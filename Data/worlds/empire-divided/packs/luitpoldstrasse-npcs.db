You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess.

The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Helmut sees the theft of the Ottinger papers as a blow against a corrupt establishment.

Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} in all Intimidated targets. You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed.

You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess.

The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>For every step larger than Medium, a creature counts as +1 creature for the sake of being outnumbered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Ranged Attacks</h3>\n<p>You gain a hefty bonus when shooting at larger targets, but for every +10 you receive, you subtract 1 from your damage. (Ex. +40 to hit Enormous, -4 Damage).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true},"specification":{"value":"Tiny","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":500000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"systems/wfrp4e/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"z9SgiPqeUodFH7pb","name":"Infected (Blood Rot)","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>The creature, or its weapon, carries a nasty infection.

Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n  <p>If larger:</p>\n  <ul type=\"disc\">\n  <li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n  <li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n  <li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul type=\"disc\">\n  <li>For every step larger than Medium, a creature counts as +1 creature for the sake of being outnumbered.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>If smaller:</p>\n  <p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n  <p>You suﬀer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <h3>Ranged Attacks</h3>\n  <p>You gain a hefty bonus when shooting at larger targets, but for every +10 you receive, you subtract 1 from your damage. (Ex. +40 to hit Enormous, -4 Damage).</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n  <p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step diﬀerence. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n  <p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n  <p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <h3>Stomp</h3>\n  <p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n  <p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n  <div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n  <table style=\"direction: ltr;

You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents. With your GM’s permission you may try to Intimidate them again in a later Round, but this will incur a negative modifier, as they are less likely to fear you having seen through your bravado once already.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Alternative Characteristics For Intimidate</h3>\n<p>While strength is the default stat for Intimidate tests, the GM may decree certain situations may allow you to use a different characteristic: a steely witch hunter may use Willpower to stare down an inquisitive bystander, or an academic may use Intelligence to cow a lowly student with his intimidating knowledge, for instance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Example: </span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Facing a group of footpads, Svetlana the Strong rolls 4 SL on her Intimidate Test.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Large","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description","core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q"}}},{"_id":"GjAYmgWNXuhzHUET","name":"Amphibious","type":"trait","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"The creature is at home in water.

Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} in all Intimidated targets. You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel","num":38,"abrev":"Fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":10,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":43},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":1400000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"t4WOIZoAdD2pgpqk","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and oﬀers 30.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>For every step larger than Medium, a creature counts as +1 creature for the sake of being outnumbered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suﬀer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Ranged Attacks</h3>\n<p>You gain a hefty bonus when shooting at larger targets, but for every +10 you receive, you subtract 1 from your damage. (Ex. +40 to hit Enormous, -4 Damage).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step diﬀerence. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true},"specification":{"value":"Small","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":100000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-content/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[]}],"effects":[]}

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

For instance, Lore (Geology) may give you an edge if fighting in a rocky cavern, or Lore (Engineering) may help you if fighting a foe armed with a complex mechanical device. You may continue building Advantage in subsequent turns providing the circumstances are correct (as determined by the GM) and you are not interrupted; you may gain a maximum Advantage equal to your Intelligence Bonus in this manner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Specializations: </span>Engineering, Geology, Heraldry, History, Law, Magick, Metallurgy, Science, Theology&nbsp;</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"adv","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"isSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"int"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":5,"costModifier":0,"force":false},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh"}}},{"_id":"wrUUDRo6hosWMNVI","name":"Ranged (Bow)","type":"skill","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/adv-skill-bs.png","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Whilst anyone can throw a rock simply using their Ballistic Skill, it takes training and practice to use weapons like bows and pistols.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Intimidate is almost always Opposed by your target’s Cool Skill; if successful, you can intimidate a number of targets up to your Strength Bonus + SL. Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause @Compendium[wfrp4e.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} in all Intimidated targets. You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>For every step larger than Medium, a creature counts as +1 creature for the sake of being outnumbered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Ranged Attacks</h3>\n<p>You gain a hefty bonus when shooting at larger targets, but for every +10 you receive, you subtract 1 from your damage. (Ex. +40 to hit Enormous, -4 Damage).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

Like her eight siblings, she was encouraged to attend university at a young age. The young girl became fascinated by medicine, and by 16 had attained one of the finest medical educations Tilea could offer. However, though obviously a prodigy, and considered by some to be Shallya reborn, Giliani was not satisfied, and travelled abroad to learn the medical practices of other Old World realms.

The precise manner of initiating an Intimidate Test depends on context: while it is generally accompanied by an overt threat, sometimes a subtle implication or even a look is enough. Intimidate is almost always Opposed by your target’s Cool Skill; if successful, you can intimidate a number of targets up to your Strength Bonus + SL. Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause @Compendium[wfrp4e.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} in all Intimidated targets. You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents. With your GM’s permission you may try to Intimidate them again in a later Round, but this will incur a negative modifier, as they are less likely to fear you having seen through your bravado once already.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Alternative Characteristics For Intimidate</h3>\n<p>While strength is the default stat for Intimidate tests, the GM may decree certain situations may allow you to use a different characteristic: a steely witch hunter may use Willpower to stare down an inquisitive bystander, or an academic may use Intelligence to cow a lowly student with his intimidating knowledge, for instance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Example: </span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Facing a group of footpads, Svetlana the Strong rolls 4 SL on her Intimidate Test.

With your GM’s permission you may try to Intimidate them again in a later Round, but this will incur a negative modifier, as they are less likely to fear you having seen through your bravado once already.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Alternative Characteristics For Intimidate</h3>\n<p>While strength is the default stat for Intimidate tests, the GM may decree certain situations may allow you to use a different characteristic: a steely witch hunter may use Willpower to stare down an inquisitive bystander, or an academic may use Intelligence to cow a lowly student with his intimidating knowledge, for instance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Example: </span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Facing a group of footpads, Svetlana the Strong rolls 4 SL on her Intimidate Test.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;
