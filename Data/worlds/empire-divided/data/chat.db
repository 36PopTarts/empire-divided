to the monastery of Taal in free territory of Frugelhorn to try and impress him.&nbsp; While there, he saw some Questing Knights of Bretonnia who stopped and regaled him with their recent exploits.<br />Dieter than decided that he wanted to be a Bretonnian Knight.&nbsp; When he was not helping raise the family in place of his mother and helping Alexei with Taal work, he absorbed knightly romances voraciously.<br />Alexei bought him Gaston (originally named Trotter) in the hopes that he could redirect Dieter's enthusiam to into being a Longshank.&nbsp; Met Galina while practing his riding far afield.&nbsp; She woed him and Dieter aqcueised after a while <br />when he realized his children could be as tall as her.&nbsp; Trying to be a provider of a father, which includes attempting to have kids.&nbsp; Went back to Stirland with her to get poop thrown at him before their wedding.<br /><br />Dieter's motivation is to be remembered to the point he has epics, plays, poems, and books written about him.&nbsp; He thinks that if he just does enough noble deeds he can become a Bretonnian Knight, despite not being a knight or a Bretonnian.<br />He believes in the idealized version of the Bretonnian Knights that serves their lord, the realm, and helps the needy.&nbsp; Righting wrongs and serving justice wherever he goes (not necessarily to the letter of the law).&nbsp; His wife has to constantly tie him back to reality and practical problems.<br />Dieter prays for the Blessing of the Lady each time he knows he is going into a battle.&nbsp; Since he does not know the actual pray though, he says a modified Taal pray instead.<br />Attempts to be good humored about life's troubles, suiting his Hochland ancestry.&nbsp; He is open minded about the fact that other people live their lives by different standards than he and thinks that probably suits them quite well.<br /><br />Dieter is convinced that Gaston is the reincarnation of some hero of the past.&nbsp; When he was younger he of course assumed he was once a Bretonnian Knight, hence his name, but now realizes the chances are realisticly low.<br />He could be the hero of some far off country like Cathay, or maybe a hero of Elven or Dwarven blood.<br /><br />As part of the knightly romance he has built in his head, he wants to be the best vassal he can be and support Jurgen in his youth.&nbsp; While he also hopes that someday Jurgen will acknowledge him as a peer.<br />For Kazarick, he hopes that he too can someday experience marital bliss with a woman bethrothed only to him.&nbsp; Dieter is unsure how to best help

You use your Charm Skill to Blather. Attempt an <strong>Opposed Charm/Intelligence</strong> Test. Success gives your opponent a Stunned&nbsp;Condition. Further, for each level you have in Blather, your opponent gains another Stunned Condition.

Once the last Stunned Condition comes to an end, the target finally gets a word in, and may not be best pleased with you — after all, you have been talking about nothing or nonsense for some time.

A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed. If so, your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation using the target’s Earnings, increasing the amount according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel","num":43,"abrev":"Fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":43},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"cost":10},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[],"prepared":true},{"_id":"exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

For example, a successful Trade (Apothecary) Test may be useful if fighting in an Apothecary’s shop as you identify some astringent chemicals to hurl at your foes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Trade Skill is also used for enacting a Crafting Endeavor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Specialisations: </span>Apothecary, Calligrapher, Chandler, Carpenter, Cook, Embalmer, Smith, Tanner&nbsp;</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"adv","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"isSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"dex"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":5,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":62},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":5100000,"flags":{},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/adv-skill-dex.png","effects":[]},"speaker":{"actor":"BNxW5IDuKy9Yws0J"},"other":"","postFunction":"basicTest"},"template":"systems/wfrp4e/templates/chat/roll/skill-card.html","rollMode":"roll","title":"Trade (Herbalist) Test","hideData":false}},"type":0,"user":"hWNxrHgD6tOVKAVx","timestamp":1633294641174,"content":"<div class=\"wfrp4e chat-card\" data-actor-id data-hide=\"false\">\n\n     \n            <div class=\"chat-buttons\">\n                <a class=\"chat-button-player\" title=\"A contextual menu could be available on this card (right click)\"><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"edit-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Edit Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-edit\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"opposed-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Opposed Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-exchange-alt\"></i></a>\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content test-data\" data-actor-id data-loc data-sl=\"+5\" data-roll=\"14\" data-target=\"62\">\n                <b>Trade (Herbalist) Test</b>\n            </div>\n        \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                14\n                vs 62\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"roll\" value=\"14\" />\n                vs\n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"target\" value=\"62\" />\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle\">\n               <b>SL</b>: +5 \n            </div>\n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle \" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>SL</b>: <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"SL\" value=\"+5\" /> \n             </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content\">\n                <b>Description</b>: Impressive Success\n        \n            </div>\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n   \n</div>","speaker":{"actor":"BNxW5IDuKy9Yws0J","alias":"Kazrik Leadfoot"},"whisper":[],"_id":"xXtDLinJXsHEmCyi"}
