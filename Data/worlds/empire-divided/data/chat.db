His father, Alexei, wanted him to follow in his footsteps and perhaps even inherit his particular parish.<br />When he was 8, his father took him to the monastery of Taal in free territory of Frugelhorn to try and impress him.&nbsp; While there, he saw some Questing Knights of Bretonnia who stopped and regaled him with their recent exploits.<br />Dieter than decided that he wanted to be a Bretonnian Knight.&nbsp; When he was not helping raise the family in place of his mother and helping Alexei with Taal work, he absorbed knightly romances voraciously.<br />Alexei bought him Gaston (originally named Trotter) in the hopes that he could redirect Dieter's enthusiam to into being a Longshank.&nbsp; Met Galina while practing his riding far afield.&nbsp; She woed him and Dieter aqcueised after a while <br />when he realized his children could be as tall as her.&nbsp; Trying to be a provider of a father, which includes attempting to have kids.&nbsp; Went back to Stirland with her to get poop thrown at him before their wedding.<br /><br />Dieter's motivation is to be remembered to the point he has epics, plays, poems, and books written about him.&nbsp; He thinks that if he just does enough noble deeds he can become a Bretonnian Knight, despite not being a knight or a Bretonnian.<br />He believes in the idealized version of the Bretonnian Knights that serves their lord, the realm, and helps the needy.&nbsp; Righting wrongs and serving justice wherever he goes (not necessarily to the letter of the law).&nbsp; His wife has to constantly tie him back to reality and practical problems.<br />Dieter prays for the Blessing of the Lady each time he knows he is going into a battle.&nbsp; Since he does not know the actual pray though, he says a modified Taal pray instead.<br />Attempts to be good humored about life's troubles, suiting his Hochland ancestry.&nbsp; He is open minded about the fact that other people live their lives by different standards than he and thinks that probably suits them quite well.<br /><br />Dieter is convinced that Gaston is the reincarnation of some hero of the past.&nbsp; When he was younger he of course assumed he was once a Bretonnian Knight, hence his name, but now realizes the chances are realisticly low.<br />He could be the hero of some far off country like Cathay, or maybe a hero of Elven or Dwarven blood.<br /><br />As part of the knightly romance he has built in his head, he wants to be the best vassal he can be and support Jurgen in his youth.&nbsp; While he also hopes that someday Jurgen will acknowledge him as a peer.<br />For Kazarick, he hopes that he too can someday experience marital bliss with a woman bethrothed only to him.&nbsp; Dieter is unsure how to best help a dwarf court the ladies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attempted to learn Sturdy +10</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Had Itching pox, now immune.&nbsp;

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess.

The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

He is intelligent, cultured, insightful, sensitive, and courageous (not forgetting exceptionally handsome).</p>\n<p>So why is he a prize asset of the Altdorf Purple Hand?</p>\n<p>As a child, nine tutors were found for Wolfgang, experts in a wide range of skills from across the Old World.

However, these tutors, known as the Nine Eyes, are dedicated to subverting knowledge in the cause of their true master, Tzeentch. The Crown Prince is not a worshipper of Chaos &mdash; it is the one area in which he is notably ignorant &mdash; but through his tutors&rsquo; influence, he is primed to be sympathetic towards the Purple Hand.</p>\n<p>Or, he would be had Kastor Lieberung not subverted this plot.</p>\n<p>The very man who recruited the Nine Eyes wished the Crown Prince to be more than a political pawn.

A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed. If so, your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation using the target’s Earnings, increasing the amount according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel","num":65,"abrev":"Fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":5,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":70},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"cost":15},"sort":200000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[],"prepared":true},{"_id":"exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.

Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel","num":65,"abrev":"Fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":5,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":70},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"cost":15},"sort":200000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[],"prepared":true},{"_id":"exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.
