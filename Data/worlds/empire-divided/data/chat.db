You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation.

The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

If there is no natural hierarchy in place, or the order is particularly challenging — such as ordering your soldiers to charge a Hydra head on — the Test is Opposed by your targets’ Cool.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Leadership to encourage your subordinates. A successful Leadership Test confers a bonus of +10 to all Psychology Tests until the end of the next round (see @JournalEntry[Psychology]).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further, Leadership can be used to transfer Advantage to allies able to hear you; following a successful Leadership Test, you may transfer an Advantage to one ally of your choice, plus a further +1 Advantage per SL scored, which can again go to any allies of your choice within earshot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Example: </span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lord Ludwig von Schemp has been watching his two bodyguards discourse with some ruffians for three Rounds, using his Intuition Skill to build up 3 Advantage.

A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed. If so, your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation using the target’s Earnings, increasing the amount according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel","num":54,"abrev":"Fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":15,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":69},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"cost":30},"sort":4400000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[],"prepared":true},{"_id":"exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.

The time required for a Gossip Test depends on how circumspect the players are being, and how busy the area is, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that Gossip will be much use in combat, but if your attacker happens to be local, and you happen to know something really juicy…</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Half-Heard Whispers</h3>\n<p>While it may be expedient for GMs to quickly share information gleaned from Gossip tests to all players at once, it is often more fun to share the information only with individual players (either through a note, or through brieﬂy taking them aside). This means the players must relate this information to one another in-character — aiding the immersive roleplaying experience — which allows for mistakes and misunderstandings, sometimes leading to hilarious, or horrific, results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":10,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":45},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":5000000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[]},"speaker":{"actor":"BNxW5IDuKy9Yws0J"},"other":"","postFunction":"basicTest"},"template":"systems/wfrp4e/templates/chat/roll/skill-card.html","rollMode":"roll","title":"Gossip Test","hideData":false}},"type":0,"user":"hWNxrHgD6tOVKAVx","timestamp":1627854256291,"content":"<div class=\"wfrp4e chat-card\" data-actor-id data-hide=\"false\">\n\n     \n            <div class=\"chat-buttons\">\n                <a class=\"chat-button-player\" title=\"A contextual menu could be available on this card (right click)\"><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"edit-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Edit Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-edit\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"opposed-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Opposed Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-exchange-alt\"></i></a>\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content test-data\" data-actor-id data-loc data-sl=\"+2\" data-roll=\"33\" data-target=\"50\">\n                <b>Gossip Test</b>\n            </div>\n        \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                33\n                vs 50\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"roll\" value=\"33\" />\n                vs\n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"target\" value=\"50\" />\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle\">\n               <b>SL</b>: +2 \n            </div>\n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle \" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>SL</b>: <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"SL\" value=\"+2\" /> \n             </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content\">\n                <b>Description</b>: Success\n        \n            </div>\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n   \n</div>","speaker":{"actor":"BNxW5IDuKy9Yws0J","alias":"Kazrik Leadfoot"},"whisper":[],"_id":"7HqYPwFuaIMWM2ts"}
