The precise manner of initiating an Intimidate Test depends on context: while it is generally accompanied by an overt threat, sometimes a subtle implication or even a look is enough. Intimidate is almost always Opposed by your target’s Cool Skill; if successful, you can intimidate a number of targets up to your Strength Bonus + SL. Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} in all Intimidated targets. You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents. With your GM’s permission you may try to Intimidate them again in a later Round, but this will incur a negative modifier, as they are less likely to fear you having seen through your bravado once already.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Alternative Characteristics For Intimidate</h3>\n<p>While strength is the default stat for Intimidate tests, the GM may decree certain situations may allow you to use a different characteristic: a steely witch hunter may use Willpower to stare down an inquisitive bystander, or an academic may use Intelligence to cow a lowly student with his intimidating knowledge, for instance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Example: </span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Facing a group of footpads, Svetlana the Strong rolls 4 SL on her Intimidate Test.

If this happens, use the roll on the Critical Table to also act as the roll for the second attack. So, if you scored a critical to the head and rolled 56 on the Critical table for a Major Eye Wound, your second attack would then strike out with a to-hit value of 56. If you choose to attack with both weapons, all your defensive rolls until the start of your next Turn suffer a penalty of –10. You do not gain an Advantage when you successfully strike or Wound an opponent when Dual Wielding unless both attacks hit.</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"max":{"type":"String","label":"Max Advances","value":"ag"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":1},"career":{"value":"","type":"String","label":"Career"},"tests":{"type":"String","label":"Tests","value":"Melee or Ranged when attacking with two weapons"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":2100000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description","core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.URwIDtInCsxOoGqM"}},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/talents/dual-wielder.png","effects":[],"numMax":4,"cost":200,"prepared":true},{"_id":"cSa2nV0dGBI7D2d4","name":"In-fighter","type":"talent","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>You are skilled at drawing in close to an opponent.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed. If so, your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation using the target’s Earnings, increasing the amount according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel","num":20,"abrev":"Fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":20},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"cost":10},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[],"prepared":true},{"_id":"exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

The precise manner of initiating an Intimidate Test depends on context: while it is generally accompanied by an overt threat, sometimes a subtle implication or even a look is enough. Intimidate is almost always Opposed by your target’s Cool Skill; if successful, you can intimidate a number of targets up to your Strength Bonus + SL. Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} in all Intimidated targets. You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed. If so, your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation using the target’s Earnings, increasing the amount according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel","num":20,"abrev":"Fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":20},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"cost":10},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[],"prepared":true},{"_id":"exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

If so, your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation using the target’s Earnings, increasing the amount according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel","num":20,"abrev":"Fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":20},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"cost":10},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[],"prepared":true},{"_id":"exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.

Intimidate is almost always Opposed by your target’s Cool Skill; if successful, you can intimidate a number of targets up to your Strength Bonus + SL. Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} in all Intimidated targets. You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} in all Intimidated targets.

Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed. If so, your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation using the target’s Earnings, increasing the amount according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel","num":20,"abrev":"Fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":20},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"cost":10},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[],"prepared":true},{"_id":"exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

The precise manner of initiating an Intimidate Test depends on context: while it is generally accompanied by an overt threat, sometimes a subtle implication or even a look is enough. Intimidate is almost always Opposed by your target’s Cool Skill; if successful, you can intimidate a number of targets up to your Strength Bonus + SL. Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} in all Intimidated targets. You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed. If so, your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation using the target’s Earnings, increasing the amount according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel","num":20,"abrev":"Fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":20},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"cost":10},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[],"prepared":true},{"_id":"exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed. If so, your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation using the target’s Earnings, increasing the amount according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation.

The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed. If so, your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation using the target’s Earnings, increasing the amount according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel","num":20,"abrev":"Fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":20},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"},"cost":10},"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[],"prepared":true},{"_id":"exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq","name":"Charm","type":"skill","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Charm makes people think favorably of you, your opinions, and proposed actions.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

The precise manner of initiating an Intimidate Test depends on context: while it is generally accompanied by an overt threat, sometimes a subtle implication or even a look is enough. Intimidate is almost always Opposed by your target’s Cool Skill; if successful, you can intimidate a number of targets up to your Strength Bonus + SL. Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you cause @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear} in all Intimidated targets. You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents.
