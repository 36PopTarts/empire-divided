If the crowd is unruly, or not receptive to your words, the test is opposed by the crowd’s average Willpower (typically 35). A failure shows the crowd is unconvinced. the public speaking and master orator talents can significantly increase the number of people you affect with public speaking. an astounding Failure (-6) (see page 152) in a charm test means your crowd quickly becomes an angry mob, with you as the target of their ire…&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Begging</h3>\n<p>The Charm skill can be used to beg on the streets. A successful test will scrounge Fellowship Bonus × SL brass pennies per hour from passers-by, with the Difficulty modified by the pitch chosen for begging, and how much sympathy your appearance can elicit. If you score no SL, but still pass the skill test, you only manage to scrounge a single pfennig. an astounding Failure (-6) means you may have attracted problems from the local Watchmen, found some trouble with&nbsp; other, local beggars, or suffer some other significant set-back.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Characters who are caught begging by their peers or associates will likely lose status unless they are already in the Beggar, or in some other destitute, career.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":10,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":45},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":4000000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[]},"speaker":{"actor":"BNxW5IDuKy9Yws0J"},"other":"<b>Argumentative</b>: Can use unit place for base SL (+0 bonus SL) if debating.","postFunction":"basicTest"},"template":"systems/wfrp4e/templates/chat/roll/skill-card.html","rollMode":"roll","title":"Charm Test","hideData":false}},"type":0,"user":"hWNxrHgD6tOVKAVx","timestamp":1633893869588,"content":"<div class=\"wfrp4e chat-card\" data-actor-id data-hide=\"false\">\n\n     \n            <div class=\"chat-buttons\">\n                <a class=\"chat-button-player\" title=\"A contextual menu could be available on this card (right click)\"><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"edit-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Edit Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-edit\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"opposed-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Opposed Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-exchange-alt\"></i></a>\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content test-data\" data-actor-id data-loc data-sl=\"+1\" data-roll=\"45\" data-target=\"50\">\n                <b>Charm Test</b>\n            </div>\n        \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                45\n                vs 50\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"roll\" value=\"45\" />\n                vs\n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"target\" value=\"50\" />\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle\">\n               <b>SL</b>: +1 \n            </div>\n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle \" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>SL</b>: <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"SL\" value=\"+1\" /> \n             </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content\">\n                <b>Description</b>: Marginal Success\n        \n            </div>\n        \n    \n                <div class=\"card-content\">\n                <b>Other</b>: <b>Argumentative</b>: Can use unit place for base SL (+0 bonus SL) if debating.\n                </div>\n    \n    \n\n   \n</div>","speaker":{"scene":"ISUHNZhYj1YuMgME","actor":"BNxW5IDuKy9Yws0J","token":"yidiaioWgjiInmDz","alias":"Kazrik Leadfoot"},"whisper":[],"_id":"ID7bijyrWUMwCAtI"}

Each SL either offers you an additional piece of information, or the chance to spread a rumor to a number of individuals equal to your Fellowship Bonus. The time required for a Gossip Test depends on how circumspect the players are being, and how busy the area is, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that Gossip will be much use in combat, but if your attacker happens to be local, and you happen to know something really juicy…</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Half-Heard Whispers</h3>\n<p>While it may be expedient for GMs to quickly share information gleaned from Gossip tests to all players at once, it is often more fun to share the information only with individual players (either through a note, or through brieﬂy taking them aside). This means the players must relate this information to one another in-character — aiding the immersive roleplaying experience — which allows for mistakes and misunderstandings, sometimes leading to hilarious, or horrific, results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":5,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":43},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":5000000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[]},"speaker":{"actor":"fcIUXb2sCaEDcomN"},"other":"","postFunction":"basicTest"},"template":"systems/wfrp4e/templates/chat/roll/skill-card.html","rollMode":"roll","title":"Gossip Test","hideData":false,"fortuneUsedReroll":true}},"type":0,"user":"Jvf2teS6cv0359RH","timestamp":1633892024223,"content":"<div class=\"wfrp4e chat-card\" data-actor-id data-hide=\"false\">\n\n     \n            <div class=\"chat-buttons\">\n                <a class=\"chat-button-player\" title=\"A contextual menu could be available on this card (right click)\"><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"edit-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Edit Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-edit\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"opposed-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Opposed Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-exchange-alt\"></i></a>\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content test-data\" data-actor-id data-loc data-sl=\"+4\" data-roll=\"36\" data-target=\"68\">\n                <b>Gossip Test</b>\n            </div>\n        \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                36\n                vs 68\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"roll\" value=\"36\" />\n                vs\n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"target\" value=\"68\" />\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle\">\n               <b>SL</b>: +4 \n            </div>\n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle \" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>SL</b>: <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"SL\" value=\"+4\" /> \n             </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content\">\n                <b>Description</b>: Impressive Success\n        \n            </div>\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n   \n</div>","speaker":{"scene":"ISUHNZhYj1YuMgME","actor":"fcIUXb2sCaEDcomN","token":"OOOFLBIYVPwBTP1O","alias":"Dieter Schippel"},"whisper":[],"_id":"ovcOifnN4mO06Dyf"}
