A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed. If so, your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation using the target’s Earnings, increasing the amount according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income.

A successful Gossip Test means you have found out one useful piece of information, which your GM can impart to you, about the local area. Each SL either offers you an additional piece of information, or the chance to spread a rumor to a number of individuals equal to your Fellowship Bonus. The time required for a Gossip Test depends on how circumspect the players are being, and how busy the area is, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that Gossip will be much use in combat, but if your attacker happens to be local, and you happen to know something really juicy…</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Half-Heard Whispers</h3>\n<p>While it may be expedient for GMs to quickly share information gleaned from Gossip tests to all players at once, it is often more fun to share the information only with individual players (either through a note, or through brieﬂy taking them aside). This means the players must relate this information to one another in-character — aiding the immersive roleplaying experience — which allows for mistakes and misunderstandings, sometimes leading to hilarious, or horrific, results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":5,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":44},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":300000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[]},"speaker":{"actor":"XKEBsflN9Y1x344e"},"other":"","postFunction":"basicTest"},"template":"systems/wfrp4e/templates/chat/roll/skill-card.html","rollMode":"roll","title":"Gossip Test","hideData":false}},"type":0,"user":"hWNxrHgD6tOVKAVx","timestamp":1630872874571,"content":"<div class=\"wfrp4e chat-card\" data-actor-id data-hide=\"false\">\n\n     \n            <div class=\"chat-buttons\">\n                <a class=\"chat-button-player\" title=\"A contextual menu could be available on this card (right click)\"><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"edit-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Edit Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-edit\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"opposed-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Opposed Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-exchange-alt\"></i></a>\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content test-data\" data-actor-id data-loc data-sl=\"+2\" data-roll=\"50\" data-target=\"69\">\n                <b>Gossip Test</b>\n            </div>\n        \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                50\n                vs 69\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"roll\" value=\"50\" />\n                vs\n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"target\" value=\"69\" />\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle\">\n               <b>SL</b>: +2 \n            </div>\n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle \" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>SL</b>: <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"SL\" value=\"+2\" /> \n             </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content\">\n                <b>Description</b>: Success\n        \n            </div>\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n   \n</div>","speaker":{"actor":"XKEBsflN9Y1x344e","alias":"Gerhardt Muller"},"whisper":[],"_id":"hrtf3gis1IeJNDtr"}
