Each SL either offers you an additional piece of information, or the chance to spread a rumor to a number of individuals equal to your Fellowship Bonus. The time required for a Gossip Test depends on how circumspect the players are being, and how busy the area is, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that Gossip will be much use in combat, but if your attacker happens to be local, and you happen to know something really juicy…</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Half-Heard Whispers</h3>\n<p>While it may be expedient for GMs to quickly share information gleaned from Gossip tests to all players at once, it is often more fun to share the information only with individual players (either through a note, or through brieﬂy taking them aside). This means the players must relate this information to one another in-character — aiding the immersive roleplaying experience — which allows for mistakes and misunderstandings, sometimes leading to hilarious, or horrific, results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"advanced":{"value":"bsc","type":"String"},"grouped":{"value":"noSpec","type":"String"},"characteristic":{"type":"String","label":"Characteristic","value":"fel"},"advances":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":10,"costModifier":0},"modifier":{"type":"Number","label":"Advances","value":0},"total":{"type":"Number","label":"Total","value":55},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":700001,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/basic-skill-fel.png","effects":[]},"speaker":{"actor":"T6Yj9vHdvwEeweRu"},"other":"","postFunction":"basicTest"},"template":"systems/wfrp4e/templates/chat/roll/skill-card.html","rollMode":"roll","title":"Gossip Test","hideData":false}},"type":0,"user":"0ASvjGC88ifVZG73","timestamp":1642365154113,"content":"<div class=\"wfrp4e chat-card\" data-actor-id data-hide=\"false\">\n\n     \n            <div class=\"chat-buttons\">\n                <a class=\"chat-button-player\" title=\"A contextual menu could be available on this card (right click)\"><i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"edit-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Edit Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-edit\"></i></a>\n                <a class=\"opposed-toggle chat-button-gm\" title=\"Opposed Test\"><i class=\"fas fa-exchange-alt\"></i></a>\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content test-data\" data-actor-id data-loc data-sl=\"-1\" data-roll=\"73\" data-target=\"60\">\n                <b>Gossip Test</b>\n            </div>\n        \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                73\n                vs 60\n            </div>\n    \n            <div class=\"card-content hide-option display-toggle\" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>Roll</b>: \n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"roll\" value=\"73\" />\n                vs\n                <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"target\" value=\"60\" />\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle\">\n               <b>SL</b>: -1 \n            </div>\n            <div class=\"card-content display-toggle \" style=\"display:none\">\n                <b>SL</b>: <input class=\"card-edit\" type=\"text\" data-edit-type=\"SL\" value=\"-1\" /> \n             </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"card-content\">\n                <b>Description</b>: Marginal Failure\n        \n            </div>\n        \n    \n    \n    \n\n   \n</div>","speaker":{"scene":"X5ju3GQjkOFb1Tbi","actor":"T6Yj9vHdvwEeweRu","token":null,"alias":"Jurgen von Haalstein"},"whisper":[],"_id":"mFGkrLR3HqxKb25C"}

If the crowd is unruly, or not receptive to your words, the test is opposed by the crowd’s average Willpower (typically 35).
