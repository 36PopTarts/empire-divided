{"_id":"01PN4MXAyw3mxvZl","name":"Fate and Resilience","content":"<p>Whether it’s guts, luck or the favour of the gods, there is something special about you. Fate and Resilience represent the different ways you stand out from the masses. </p>\n<p>Characters gain their starting Fate and Resilience in Character Generation. Both are related to pools of points: Fate to Fortune, Resilience to Resolve. You may spend your points to achieve small benefits, and these pools will refill over the course of play. You spend your Fate or Resilience points for a significant benefit during play but this permanently reduces them and also reduces the associated pool of Fortune or Resolve points. While Fate and Resilience points may be regained, this occurs only rarely, so spend them carefully. </p>\n<p>Although they are very rare and normally reserved for PCs, the GM may also want to apply Fate and Resilience to noteworthy NPCs, like a necromantic nemesis, a local luminary of significance, or a recurring cult leader.</p>\n<h3>Fate and Fortune</h3>\n<p>Player characters have destiny. While their ultimate future is a mystery and there is no guarantee it will be glorious, heroic, or even pleasant, they are seemingly fated for something important.</p>\n<p>To represent this, you begin play with a number of Fate Points. Fate points mark you out from the rest of the denizens of the Old World. They allow you to survive against impossible odds and prevail where ordinary folk fail.</p>\n<p>Fate is directly related to your Fortune points. Fortune points are spent to receive minor bonuses, including the ability to reroll failed Tests or gain an edge as luck favours you, and the number you have will likely fluctuate wildly during play. Fate determines how many Fortune points you can have, and be permanently spent in the direst of circumstances to avoid death.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Spending Fortune</h4>\n<p>You may spend a Fortune point from your pool to turn luck to your advantage: hitting with that difficult crossbow shot when you would have otherwise missed; or perhaps an opponent slips, granting you a chance to land a blow. Your three options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reroll a failed Test</li>\n<li>Add +1 SL to a Test after it is rolled</li>\n<li>At the start of the Round, choose when to act in that Round disregarding Initiative order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Spending Fate </h4>\n<p>You may spend a permanent Fate point to avoid death and survive even the most unlikely situations. When you do this, choose one of the following two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Die Another Day</strong>: Instead of dying, your character is knocked out, left for dead, swept away by a river, or otherwise taken out of action; your character will survive, no matter the fatal incident's circumstances, but takes no further part in the current encounter.</li>\n<li><strong>How Did That Miss?</strong>: Your character completely avoids the incoming damage by some extraordinary fluke, such as slipping just as a blow is about to connect, a weapon mysteriously jamming, or an unexpected source of light blinding an opponent; your character can continue on without penalty, but has no guarantee of survival in later rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The first option takes you out of play, but allows you to fight another day, for all your character may be battered, bloody, bruised, and perhaps even captured in the process! The second option allows you to continue fighting side-by-side with your companions, but leaves you in significant danger, meaning you may need to spend more Fate points in later Rounds to ensure survival. Each option has advantages and disadvantages, depending upon the context of the situation, and it is up to you to decide which is the best choice to take.</p>\n<p>The GM describes how you survive a given situation after spending a Fate rating point. </p>\n<h4>Regaining Fate and Fortune</h4>\n<p>You regain all Fortune points at the start of every gaming session, up to the maximum of your current Fate. In addition, certain in-game encounters may also replenish (or remove!) Fortune points. </p>\n<p>Your GM may grant you a Fate point for an act of extreme heroism, bravery, or significance. Normally this only happens at the successful end of an important adventure, so make sure to spend them carefully as they rarely replenish.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Resilience and Resolve</h3>\n<p>While Fate points represent your destiny, perhaps chosen by some distant, uncaring deity, Resilience is an indication of your personal drive and determination to endure, and overcome, no matter the obstacles you face.</p>\n<p>Like Fate, Resilience is directly linked to a pool of points, this time called Resolve. Resolve points are spent to push through minor obstacles, such as ignoring the negative effects of critical wounds for a Round or removing Conditions. Resilience determines your upper limit of Resolve points and can be permanently spent to push yourself through seemingly impossible situations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Spending Resolve</h4>\n<p>You may spend a Resolve point to draw upon your inner reserves: maybe confronting a terrifying Ogre without flinching; or ignoring the effects of even the most powerful of blows. Your choices are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Become immune to Psychology until the end of the next Round.</li>\n<li>Ignore all modifiers from all Critical Wounds until the beginning of the next Round</li>\n<li>Remove one Condition; if you removed the @Condition[Prone] Condition, regain 1 Wound as you surge to your feet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Spending Resilience</h4>\n<p>You may also choose to spend Resilience point to defy the corruption curling  within, or to succeed where it would seem certain you should fail. Here, you have the following two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I Deny You!</strong>: You may choose not to develop a rolled mutation. Because you do not mutate, you do not lose any Corruption Points.</li>\n<li><strong>I Will Not Fail!</strong>: Rather than roll the result of a Test, you can choose the number instead, allowing you to succeed in even the direst situations. In an Opposed Test, you always win by at least 1 SL. You can even choose to do this on a Test already failed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Saving permanent Resilience to rebuff the influence of Chaos is wise, but it does not remove your Corruption points, meaning mutation is still perilously close. By comparison, using permanent Resilience to succeed in any Test can allow you to land a blow on an otherwise impossible-to-hit target, create an artefact that astounds all who see it with a Trade skill, or even perfectly manifest a spell you would normally find impossible to cast.</p>\n<p>When you spend a Resilience point, take time to describe the enormous feat of will your character has undertaken, and how this manifests in play.</p>\n<h4>Regaining Resilience and Resolve</h4>\n<p>Resolve is regained whenever you act according to your Motivation. During play, whenever you feel you have done this, you may ask the GM if you can recover one or more Resolve points.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Griselda is a nun with the Motivation ‘Sigmar’. While her allies gossip in a tavern seeking clues, she elects to visit the local temple to make a donation and offer prayers to her deity. As this fits her Motivation, her GM decides to replenish one of her Resolve points but tells Griselda’s player that she will need to pray and donate in a different temple to receive that benefit again this week. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The GM may grant a Resilience point for an act of extreme importance to your Motivation, permanently nourishing your soul, but such an event will be very rare.</p>\n<p>Example: After many adventures, Griselda finally finances a new temple to Sigmar in her home village of Velten not far from Nuln. The GM recognises the importance of this to Griselda’s faith and grants her a permanent Resilience point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: A bandit leader is on the rampage, having built up 10 Advantage while evading the party’s blows. Things are about to get messy! Salundra decides to attack the bandit, but loses the Opposed Test by 7 SL, which is going to hurt a lot. So, she spends a permanent Resilience point to invoke ‘I Will Not Fail’. This means she automatically wins the Opposed Test by +1 SL. She also chooses the result of the roll to be 11, causing a Critical. The bandit leader will take some Wounds and a Critical Wound. More importantly, his rampage comes to an end as he also loses all 10 Advantage as the fight turns in the heroes favour. </p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"KBFMpqeeMFWhdpSI","sort":400001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":400001}}}
{"_id":"03r3y37RFKAFM82c","name":"Pursuit","content":"<p>Desperate chase scenes through busy markets and high-speed pursuits hanging from the back of careening coaches are the centrepiece of many exciting adventures. Here’s how to run a pursuit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Determine Distance </strong>— The GM decides how far ahead the pursued are from the pursuers, and assigns a number to represent the size of the head start, called the Distance. Typically, this will range from 1 for those almost in reach, to 4 for those with a good lead, to 8 for those almost beyond reach when the pursuit begins.</li>\n<li><strong>Test</strong> — Everyone actively moving in the pursuit rolls a Test for their movement — typically this will be a Drive, Ride, or Athletics Test depending upon the circumstances. </li>\n<li><strong>Update Distance</strong> — The lowest SL of the pursued and the highest SL of the pursuers is compared, the difference between these is added to the Distance if the pursued won, and subtracted from the Distance number if the pursuers won.</li>\n<li><strong>Determine Outcome</strong> — If the Distance falls to 0 or less, the pursuers have caught their quarry! The pursued can then sacrifice their slowest member that Round to delay the pursuers as the rest continue to flee, or they can stop and confront their pursuers. If the slowest of the pursued is abandoned, the pursuers decide who stops to confront the unfortunate and who continues in pursuit. If the poor abandoned runner is not a priority target it’s quite likely the pursuers will continue their pursuit of their target. If Distance reaches 10+, the pursuers have lost their quarry and the pursuit is over… for now! If the Distance is still 1–9, the pursuit continues, return to step 2.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As each Round passes, it’s important to describe what just happened in a fun and exciting fashion. If you score a large SL, describe people getting out of the way, giving you an opportunity to make ground. If you score a negative SL, describe tripping over crates, running into people, or slamming your coach against a wall, slowing you down.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong><em>: Eichengard and Sigrid are chasing three cultists through the streets of Altdorf. The cultists got a decent head start, so the GM gives him a lead of Distance 2. Each character rolls an Athletics Test to start the pursuit. Sigrid scores +3 SL;  the cultists score +0, +2, and +2 SL; and Eichengard scores +2 SL. </em></p>\n<p><em>So, after the first round, the difference between the slowest cultist (0) and the fastest pursuing character (Sigrid with 3) is 3, meaning that the characters catch up with the cultists. The cowardly cultists abandon their slowest member in the hope of saving their hides, and Sigrid stops to subdue the abandoned aberrant. </em></p>\n<p><em>Next round the cultists start at a Distance of 1 (the difference between the next slowest cultist and Sigrid last round) so Eichengard just needs to beat them by +1 SL to catch up again.</em></p>\n<h4>Movement Modifiers</h4>\n<p>If some of the characters in the pursuit have a higher Movement, they gain a bonus SL equal to the difference in Movement. So, if you had Move 5 and you were chasing a Move 4 character, you would gain +1 SL on your pursuit roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Perdita is urging her horse forwards, trying to chase down two Bandits. Her horse has Movement 8, where the Bandits are on Movement 7 and Movement 9 horses. Thus, the first Bandit has an unmodified Test, Perdita gains a bonus of +1 SL, and the second Bandit gains a bonus of +2 SL when they all roll their Ride (Horse) Tests.</em></p>","folder":"xeg3gSX34lWS8L4B","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Moving"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Moving","sort":300001}}}

{"_id":"0axJFzuRiFgSagii","name":"Attacking","content":"<p>One of the most common Actions is to attack an opponent. To make a ranged attack, your weapon must be in range and your target visible in line-of-sight. For melee attacks, you must be adjacent your target with a weapon ready (see Engaged).</p>\n<h4>1: Roll to Hit</h4>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong>: To attack, perform an Opposed Melee Test with your Opponent (both you and your opponent Test your Melee Skill). Whoever scores the highest SL wins. If you win the Test, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage. If you lose the Opposed Test, your opponent gains +1 Advantage and your Action is finished.</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged</strong>: Roll a Ranged Test for the weapon you’re using. If you are successful, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage. If you fail, your Action is over. Your opponent doesn’t gain Advantage in ranged combat.</p>\n<p>In both melee and ranged Combat, it’s possible to score an impressive hit called a Critical, or to make a mistake, called a Fumble. See Criticals and Fumbles in the section below.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Test to hit your opponent with your weapon. This Test is Opposed in melee. Any winner gains +1 Advantage.</em></p>\n<h4>2: Determine Hit Location</h4>\n<p>If you successfully hit, find out where — reverse the roll to hit and compare this number to the Hit Locations table. So, a roll of 23 to hit would become 32 on the table, a hit on the Right Arm.</p>\n<p>Creatures with different body shapes may use different hit location tables.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong>Location is&nbsp;<strong>not reversed&nbsp;</strong>in Foundry. Instead, an entirely separate dice roll is performed to find the location. Additionally, you can assign a creature a specific hit location table in the configuration menu, accessible by the \"Configure\" button at the top of the sheet</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>3: Determine Damage</h4>\n<p>Once you have determined the hit location, it is time to work out how much Damage you deal. Each weapon has a Weapon Damage characteristic. This is usually your modified Strength Bonus for melee weapons, or a fixed number for ranged weapons. Take the SL of your Opposed Test and add it to the Weapon Damage of the weapon you’re using. This final number is your Damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><em>: Damage = Weapon Damage + SL</em></p>\n<h4>4: Apply Damage</h4>\n<p>Using the Damage and the Hit Location you struck, you now see how many Wounds your opponent loses from your attack. Subtract your opponent’s Toughness Bonus and any Armour Points protecting the Hit Location from your Damage. The remaining Damage is suffered as Wounds by your opponent. If this is 1 or less, your opponent has shrugged off the worst of the attack and only loses 1 Wound.&nbsp; Should the Wounds lost exceed your opponent’s remaining Wounds total, your opponent takes a Critical Wound (see page 172) and gains the Prone Condition (see page 169).</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Wounds Suffered = Damage – opponent’s (Toughness Bonus + Armour Points)</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Opposing A Melee Attack</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">You can Oppose an incoming melee attack with more than just your Melee Skill. The most obvious choice is Dodge, which allows you to avoid incoming blows, but there are many other Skills that just might be useful in combat, including Intimidate, Charm, Leadership, and more. If your GM thinks it’s appropriate for the situation, and you’re happy missing out on the opportunity to score a Critical Hit against your opponent, then why not give it a go.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Engaged</h4>\n<p>Whenever you attack an opponent, or are attacked, in melee combat, you count as Engaged. This means you are tussling with each other in a fight, and others rules (due to Talents, Spells, etc.) for being Engaged might apply. If you don’t attack each other for a full Round, you are no longer Engaged.</p>","img":null,"folder":"c8pB03MJECRvVVdb","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Combat"}}}

{"_id":"0hJn73SxER55dvmA","name":"The GM's Goals & Principles","content":"<p>Whilst it&rsquo;s one thing to know how to GM the systems of WFRP, it&rsquo;s another thing entirely to know how to GM the world. To help with this vital part of roleplaying, we&rsquo;ve outlined goals to follow, and a set of principles to help you choose between multiple courses of action.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The goals and principles are used in similar ways by many roleplaying games to help GMs answer the question &lsquo;<em>What should happen next?</em>&rsquo; These tools are designed to help novice-to-experienced GMs align themselves with <strong>WFRP</strong>, and to think critically about the kind of experience they want their Players to have.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These tools are not prescriptive. If you don&rsquo;t follow them, you&rsquo;re not playing the game &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;. But we encourage you to be open to trying them out &mdash; you may find they suit your group well!</p>\n<p>Lastly, this section details the thematic pillars that hold up Warhammer, and give some guidance on how to accentuate and focus on individual themes over the course of your campaigns.</p>\n<h2>The GM's Goal</h2>\n<p>The following list explains your goal as the GM, beyond that laid out in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. These four points should tell you what you&rsquo;re trying to do, and why. Everything you do as a GM should serve these four goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the Old World come to life</li>\n<li>Create gripping and action-packed&nbsp;scenarios</li>\n<li>Build a story together</li>\n<li>Understand the Characters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Make the Old World Come to Life</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;re there to make the Old World feel real, filled with believable people and places. But the Old World is a weird and often impossible place &mdash; with Beastmen, magic, mutation, and Chaos &mdash; so your job is to ground that in reality. What does it mean to have Second Sight? What is it really like to face a horde of ravening Greenskins?</p>\n<h3>Create Gripping and Action-Packed Scenarios</h3>\n<p>As a GM you&rsquo;re there to inject drama and conflict into the lives of the Characters. You&rsquo;re there to place walls between them and their Ambitions, and to tempt their Motivations with rewards. But Warhammer thrives on the mundane, juxtaposed with the epic. You&rsquo;re there to make injury and illness exciting, to make the quest to afford one more meal, or a roof over one&rsquo;s head, worthwhile.</p>\n<h3>Build A Story Together</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;re there to facilitate group storytelling. You&rsquo;re there to share the spotlight, as evenly as possible, so everyone at the table has the opportunity to contribute. You&rsquo;re not there to script the outcome of any action, but to interpret your Adventure, and the actions of your Characters.</p>\n<h3>Understand the Characters</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;re there to discover how the Characters are going to get through the challenges you give them. You&rsquo;re there to be surprised and entertained, just like the other Players are! Don&rsquo;t bother writing Adventures with balance or solutions in mind &mdash; in fact, throw your own solutions out the window. Present problems, and let your Players solve them creatively.</p>\n<h2>The GM's Principles</h2>\n<p>The following principles should be a guide: advice on what to do and not do in general. These aren&rsquo;t specific instances of &lsquo;<em>when X happens, do Y&rsquo;,</em> but rather good ways to approach running a game of <strong>WFRP</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reveal the Old World</li>\n<li>Incorporate the Characters</li>\n<li>Embody Uncaring Gods</li>\n<li>Evil is Rampant, Good is Rare 0&nbsp; Focus on the Characters</li>\n<li>Everyone Has a History</li>\n<li>Lead the Players to Their Story 0 Be a Friend, and an Enemy</li>\n<li>Always Advance the Story&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Embrace Conflict</li>\n<li>Be Truthful (to Players)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reveal the Old World</h3>\n<p>The Old World isn&rsquo;t like most fantasy lands. It is full of juxtapositions and conflicts: a middle class rising up from the oppressed peasants under the boot of the tyrannical nobility; the conflicts of doctrine between the preaching, doom-laden churches of the myriad cults; the screaming of babies with empty stomachs, drowned out by the crashing of plate armour, and the beat of drums as the Imperial Army marches by. The Old World is grim, gritty, and largely &mdash; but not entirely &mdash; without hope. Flickers of life, of happiness, and a gallows-humour peek through, which prove the indomitable spirit of Humanity, and shed light on Sigmar&rsquo;s Heirs.</p>\n<p>You should work to cultivate knowledge, not just of the Old World as described in practical terms &mdash; the towns, rivers, forests, and so on &mdash; but also the themes and imagery that make it unique. You should consume media that shows off the glory and tragedy of the Renaissance, and then flood it with monsters, and magic at its edges.</p>\n<h3>Incorporate the Characters</h3>\n<p>Speak directly to the Characters, not the Players. State clearly the information that would be apparent to them. Remember that we, as people, take cues from our world: smells, sounds, the way someone twitches. These cues can be wrong, disguised, or misleading, but we still take them in. The Players should interrogate a scene by using their Character&rsquo;s Skills, but you should be vigilant to give that information up front &mdash; and direct it at the Characters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: &lsquo;Hans, you can tell the woman isn&rsquo;t saying what she truly feels. You can&rsquo;t tell why, but she&rsquo;s holding something back, and her hand keeps slipping to the belt at her waist. She&rsquo;s on edge, her eyes almost pleading with you not to force her to act rashly.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This passage tells us a lot more than a clinical description of what&rsquo;s happening: it breaths context and emotion into the Scene, and Hans&rsquo;s Player will feel it more. It&rsquo;s more visceral.</p>\n<h3>Embody Uncaring Gods</h3>\n<p>Look through the eyes of uncaring Gods! Nothing is sacred in the Old World, when you look at it from on high. Nothing is beyond being killed, burned, maimed, or crushed. Consider always how things could get worse, and put those threats against all of your creations. No NPC is safe, no boon given to a Character is permanent.</p>\n<p>Further, consider the malevolence of the Ruinous Powers. Always look for the failings in every Character that crosses your path. How can you tempt them? How can you corrupt them? How can you raise them up, only to bring them low again? Pull no punches.</p>\n<h3>Evil is Rampant, Good is Rare</h3>\n<p>Reward evil, punish the good. Crime pays. Chaos runs rampant not through the lack of heroes, but the abundance of villains. The easy way out is almost always unclean. The right thing to do comes without reward, without celebration, and often with a knife in one&rsquo;s back. Look always to offer easier solutions through compromised means, and stress that the world is unkind to optimists.</p>\n<h3>Focus on the Characters</h3>\n<p>Despite the Old World being an awful place to be, and our Characters are frequently far from heroes, in the end the story is about them. They may not always be the focal point of the stories unfolding around them, but they are our focus for how the story is told. They are our protagonists. You should be always hoping for the best for your Players&rsquo; Characters, whilst setting threats in their path. Every Combat should be one you hope they survive. Every moment your Players are on the edges of their seats, so you should be!</p>\n<p>But, like any good story, we can only hope if there is something threatening that hope. You are not focusing on your Characters if you fail to create appropriate challenges for them to tackle. By that same token, you do not focus on your Characters if you never let them celebrate, nor celebrate with them. You are not there to be their enemy, but to present enemies for them to &mdash; hopefully &mdash; overcome.</p>\n<h3>Everyone Has a History</h3>\n<p>Name everyone &mdash; give them a home and a heart. The Old World is made of regular people, not caricatures. Everyone has a name, a history, a home, and a heart. Though evil does truly exist in the Old World, it is almost always a tool to follow one&rsquo;s ambitions and dreams. No one commits evil for no reason, not even the monsters of the deepest darkest places.</p>\n<p>You should strive to give a reason for things, and for the actions of the NPCs. These need not be complex, covering multiple pages of notes, but they should exist. A good rule is to give every NPC a Motivation and at least one Ambition.</p>\n<h3>Lead the Playres to Their Story</h3>\n<p>Ask leading questions, and build on the answers. Don&rsquo;t just ask, &lsquo;<em>Johann, you&rsquo;re a soldier, do you have any scars?&rsquo; </em>but rather<em> &lsquo;Johann, who gave you your worst scar, and how does that memory haunt you to this day?</em>&rsquo;&nbsp; The latter invites creativity far more than the former. It gives agency to a Player to describe their Character in depth. Further, the answers should be used by you at a later point to give weight to a Scene. Perhaps Johann got his scar from a Beastman&rsquo;s axe? Later, maybe Johann finds a body in the forest, with wounds made by an axe that shares an uncomfortable similarity to his own scar&hellip;</p>\n<p>These questions can also be used to disclaim decision making, granting the authority to the Players. If they ask, &lsquo;<em>Is there a chandelier in this room that I can swing off of?</em>&rsquo; you could answer &lsquo;<em>Yes</em>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<em>No</em>,&rsquo; or better yet, &lsquo;<em>There wouldn&rsquo;t normally be, but why don&rsquo;t you tell me why there is?</em>&rsquo; These sorts of leading, disclaimed questions allow the Players to share in the world, and make it feel like their own.</p>\n<h3>Be a Friend, and an Enemy</h3>\n<p>Give with one hand, and take with the other. Warhammer isn&rsquo;t about getting what you want. Or rather, it&rsquo;s about getting what you want at horrendous cost. With every inch of ground the Characters claim, new problems, threats, and scars are sure to arise. They should pay for every victory in blood &mdash; often that of their enemies, but their own is very much on the line. Even simple things, like moving one rung up the social ladder, means someone else is displaced, and another enemy joins the fight against the Characters.</p>\n<h3>Always Advance the Story</h3>\n<p>Move off-screen, in the shadows. Whilst the story is about the Characters, it doesn&rsquo;t revolve around them. Keep the action flowing in the background. Have your NPCs act without regard for the Characters; living their own lives, pursuing their own Ambitions. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ambush the Characters, or to have opportunities pass them by. The Old World isn&rsquo;t waiting for them to solve its problems, but is driving full steam ahead toward the drop-off. If the Characters don&rsquo;t get in the road, or try to change tracks, it&rsquo;s gone &mdash; as it should be.</p>\n<p>This might mean that the Characters lose sometimes, or that they don&rsquo;t have time to solve every problem. That&rsquo;s perfect. In the real world, no one person has time to do everything, and can only act on their priorities. In the Old World, we can call our priorities our Ambitions &mdash; everything else has to fend for itself.</p>\n<h3>Embrace Conflict</h3>\n<p>Trust your Characters to create their own conflict. You rarely have to challenge the Characters directly to create conflict &mdash; trust in the Motivations and Ambitions of the Characters. Create situations that threaten those Ambitions, and promise Motivations, and your Players will get themselves into conflict. The best Adventures are ones the Characters choose to undertake themselves, so your job is to let them do that.</p>\n<h3>Be Truthful (To Players)</h3>\n<p>Speak truth to Players, speak lies to Characters. Never lie to your Players. Ever. But never tell your Characters the whole truth. This means being frank with your Players: tell them, right at the start, that not everything they&rsquo;re told will be true. But when your Players ask a question &mdash; when they use their Skills to interrogate a scene &mdash; be truthful with the information they gain. If they succeed on their Perception Test, tell them truthfully what they find. If they fail on their Intuition Test,&nbsp;tell them what they truthfully believe.&nbsp;Make sure your Players know&nbsp;the difference between&nbsp;their knowledge, and&nbsp;the knowledge of their&nbsp;Characters. Make&nbsp;them understand the&nbsp;difference between&nbsp;those truths.</p>","folder":"5lgcrfb3I58JxD8Y","sort":600001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"}}}

Whenever you are instructed to damage a piece of armour, the APs in the location damaged are reduced by 1. </p>\n<p>If this lowers the APs to 0 in that location, the armour there is rendered useless.</p>\n<p>Armour is generally damaged in one of two ways: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>A special ability triggers, such as a spell or Talent, damaging a piece of armour</li>\n<li>A Critical Wound is deflected</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Critical Deflection</h4>\n<p>This only occurs should you choose it to. If you suffer a Critical Wound from an incoming attack on a location protected by armour, you can choose to let your armour be damaged by 1AP in order to ignore the Critical Wound. </p>\n<p>You still suffer all normal Wounds (and given your APs are now 1 point lower, you probably suffer an extra Wound), but you avoid the Critical Wound effects as the blow is absorbed by your now-damaged armour.</p>\n<h4>Repairing Armour</h4>\n<p>It costs 10% of the armour’s base price per AP lost to repair it. So, if you had a Sleeved Chainmail Coat with 1AP of damage on the Body, and 1AP of damage on the Arms, it will cost you 20% of your armour’s base cost to fix it, in this case 12/–. If a section of your armour is completely broken, it will cost you 30% of the armour’s base cost to fix, and you’ll likely be waiting some time before it’s completed. </p>\n<p>You can also repair your own armour if you have the appropriate Trade Skill, Trade Tools and, for Plate Armour, a Workshop.</p>\n<h3>Armour Qualities</h3>\n<p>Armour can possess the following Armour Qualities:</p>\n<h4>Flexible</h4>\n<p>Flexible armour can be worn under a layer of non-Flexible armour if you wish. If you do so, you gain the benefit of both.</p>\n<h4>Impenetrable</h4>\n<p>The armour is especially resilient, meaning most attacks simply cannot penetrate it. All Critical Wounds caused by an odd number to hit you, such as 11 or 33, are ignored.</p>\n<h3>Armour Flaws</h3>\n<p>Some armours have points of weakness, as described by Armour Flaws.</p>\n<h4>Partial</h4>\n<p>The armour does not cover the entire hit location. An opponent that rolls an even number to hit, or rolls a Critical Hit, ignores the partial armour’s APs.</p>\n<h4>Weakpoints</h4>\n<p>The armour has small weakpoints where a blade can slip in if your opponent is sufficiently skilled or lucky. If your opponent has a weapon with the Impale Quality and scores a Critical, the APs of your armour are ignored.</p>","folder":"BrtIycD1u7HxITud","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":2,"2eWcsG16yyPBsHaS":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide","sort":100001},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LFTg4GQkhW0md8cA"}}}

To do this, you require appropriate Trade Tools, raw materials, and access to an appropriate workshop. In general, the raw materials to create the trapping of your choice will cost a quarter of the trapping’s list price, and must be purchased before Crafting begins (with an Availability as determined by the GM); the GM may rule the raw materials are cheaper or more expensive according to the trapping to be created, and the nature of the raw materials required.</p>\n<p>To craft the trapping, attempt an Extended Trade Test, with a Difficulty set by the GM, typically using the Trapping’s Availability as a loose guide.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 85px; width: 209px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 85px;\"><strong>Availability</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 117px;\"><strong>Difficulty</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 85px;\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 117px;\">Average (+20)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 85px;\">Scare</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 117px;\">Challenging (+0)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 85px;\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 117px;\">Difficult (-10)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 85px;\">Exotic</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 117px;\">Very Hard (-30)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The number of SL required to succeed at the Test is also set by the GM, using the listed price for the trapping in the Consumers’ Guide as a reference.</p>\n<p>The SL required is further modified by the Qualities or Flaws you work into the trapping.

{"_id":"1LL8pYaKevaL3XR3","name":"Brunhilde Klaglich - Wasmeier's Right Hand","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/brunhilde-klaglich.webp\" width=\"274\" height=\"274\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich}</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Brunhilde is smart enough to know that Wasmeier has no loyalty to her. She works for him because it furthers her own goals. She is not a member of the Purple Hand and does not know that her master worships Tzeentch — but if she did, she wouldn't care.</p>\n<p>During the adventure, Klaglich wants to keep the taxes in place to destabilise the powerful people of Middenheim and make way for control by @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}.  Her aim is to ensure the critical NPCs support the taxes and nobody upsets the plan to replace the Graf.</p>\n<p>On a deeper level, she revels in the idea of disruption. She wants to see the current order torn down, because she believes that society must be constantly renewed through turmoil and disorder. She does not want a better world, she just wants to upset the current one.</p>\n<p>Klaglich takes great personal satisfaction in outwitting others. If she can, she deceives and lies to others whenever the opportunity presents itself — it makes her feel superior.</p>\n<h4>Potion of Resistance</h4>\n<p>This potion makes the drinker utterly incoherent, as though drunk, but at the same time immune to pain. These effects last [[/r 2+d10]] hours. During this time, the imbiber suffers three @Condition[Stunned] Conditions, and cannot make Endurance Tests to remove them until the effects of the potion wear off. During that time, they also gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.IAWyzDfC286a9MPz]{Immunity to Psychology} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.wMwSRDmgiF2IdCJr]{Painless} Traits, making them immune to interrogation and torture.</p>\n<h3>Secret Identities</h3>\n<p><strong>Brunhilde Klaglich</strong>: Undisguised, Brunhilde is a striking woman with blonde hair, unusually bright green eyes, and full lips. She has an open, friendly expression that completely belies her personality. Going about the city, she wears plain burgher’s clothes and a broad hat with a brim that’s easily pulled down to shadow her face. </p>\n<p><strong>Elise Kaltblutig</strong>: When in the role she used to blackmail @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}, Brunhilde wears her hair dyed black, centre-parted and scraped back in coiled braids on the back of her head. She rouges her skin to make it look flushed and pushes cotton wadding into her cheeks to make them fuller. Her simple clothes are typical of an Ulrican pilgrim. When meeting Ar-Ulric, she pulls a grey cowl over her head and speaks in a flat monotone.</p>\n<p><strong>Frau Kenner</strong>: In this guise, Klaglich plays to the Chancellor’s inexperience with women. She wears her blonde hair down and speaks softly but persuasively from under a deep blue hood. Her fingers are covered with silver rings bearing Ranaldite symbols. She affects a coastal Nordlander accent.</p>\n<p><strong>‘Charlotte’</strong>: When she hypnotised @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}, Klaglich looked and acted like the kind of attractive person who floats on the periphery of carousers in Middenheim’s upmarket taverns. She wore a wig with brown curly hair, a great deal of makeup, and a revealing dress, but nothing that attracted too much attention. If she suspects Schmiedehammer’s hypnosis is wearing off, she uses this disguise to revisit him.</p>\n<p><strong>Baroness Marlena Klochmann</strong>: If she needs to talk directly with @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, Klaglich visits him disguised as a Middenland minor noble. She powders her skin to make it very pale, streaks her hair with grey ash, and uses a tight corset to change her shape and stiffen her movements. She wears outdated but expensive robes and speaks in a refined, dry voice — at least until she can be sure that she and the Law Lord are alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Zena Kroll</strong>: If the party make good progress in their investigation, Klaglich may engage them directly as Zena Kroll — who looks exactly like a ‘potential replacement party member’. She approaches them in the @JournalEntry[ieHrUyFz83TkBikg]{Templar’s Arms} and introduces herself as a former road warden looking to join an adventuring party. She asks them about their exploits and then subtly drops a clue to implicate the Gausser family of Nordland in a clandestine plot to influence the Graf and destabilise Middenheim. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Middenheim)</strong> Test reveals that the Gaussers have often voiced disquiet at Todbringer influence in Nordland. ‘Zena’ also hints that Nordlanders are suspect anyway, what with so many of them having Norscan blood. This is an attempt to put the Characters off the scent, and maybe even get them away from Middenheim. </p>\n<p>As Zena, she rubs dust into her skin and hair to look beaten. She wears hardy, travel-stained clothes, and the remnants of a Delberz road warden’s uniform. </p>\n<p>If this plan works a little too well, a GM could clue the party into the fact that they have been tricked without exactly exposing Klaglich. When the party are miles north of Middenheim, she vanishes into the night, leaving them stranded in inhospitable terrain while she flees back to the city to regain control of the other folks she has tricked.</p>\n<p>Klaglich is an expert at disguise. To recognise that any of the above are the same person requires a specific inspection, and a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test. </p>\n<p>That said, there are several ‘tells’ that reveal her true identity. Anyone getting into conversation or glimpsing her full face notices her bright green eyes (+10 to <strong>Perception </strong>Tests to see through her disguise). </p>\n<p>Moreover, the carrier pigeons she uses to communicate with Wasmeier tend to drop feathers that get everywhere. There’s a good chance there are pigeon feathers on her clothes, despite her best efforts at disguise.</p>\n<h3>Schemes </h3>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} and Klaglich know exactly who has influence on the Graf, so they focused their plotting on the most critical NPCs. As a summary, here are the schemes that Klaglich used to secure support for the taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: She deals drugs to him in the guise of Frau Kenner. She has threatened to break off his supply if he does not support the new taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: Disguised as ‘Charlotte’, she hypnotised him on a night when he was drinking with friends. He now offers unthinking support for the taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Reiner Ehrlich} – Law Lord</strong>: Wasmeier arranged for a Chaos band to kidnap Ehrlich’s niece Reya and smuggle her into the city, where she is kept prisoner by Klaglich and her henchmen. The girl is now in the @JournalEntry[n2j6nlkc2s2LcieJ]{ruined house} that Klaglich uses as a hideout.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Klaglich obtained letters between Ar-Ulric and @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} that revealed an affair between the High Priest and the Graf ’s paramour. Disguised as Elise Kaltblutig, she blackmailed him into supporting the taxes.</p>\n<p>If the GM wants to add complexity to an already tricky scenario, Klaglich may fall back on alternative schemes, especially if the party are successfully building support to repeal the taxes:</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: Klaglich and Wasmeier know how the Graf dotes on his daughter. If forced to find additional support for the taxes, they implement a plot to blackmail the princess. Under cover of darkness, they smuggle Wasmeier’s henchman @Actor[GPmecH5STMzLNLc8]{‘Hawk’} into her chambers in a state of undress. Wasmeier then arranges for Klaglich (disguised as a palace guard) to ‘discover’ the princess with a dirty commoner. She threatens to tell the @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Chaperone Zimperlich} (impossible, of course) and the Graf about her shameful behaviour if Katarina does not support the taxes.  </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emanuelle Schlagen} – the Paramour</strong>: The Graf ’s paramour does not know that @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} is being blackmailed. If discovered, she would likely flee the city. However, Wasmeier knows she has influence over the Graf and can be manipulated if necessary. Through subterfuge, he and Klaglich hide a cache of papers and artefacts in her chambers. These implicate her as a cultist of Slaanesh, who seduced the Graf and Ar-Ulric through sorcerous wiles. Disguised as Kaltblutig, Klaglich threatens to reveal this to the Witch Hunters if Emanuelle does not support the taxes. Although the evidence is faked, it is very convincing and enough to get the paramour a biased ‘trial’ at the hands of the city’s religious authorities.</p>\n<h3>Her Actions </h3>\n<p>For simplicity’s sake, the GM may decide to use Klaglich just as a route to confronting Wasmeier, as outlined in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. It’s possible to give her more agency, where she can be used as an active opponent, working against the party’s actions as they get closer to success. Klaglich can be employed as the mirror image of @Actor[bUILl7b6hxsVqIqu]{Nastassia}, frustrating their progress if they’re advancing too easily.</p>\n<p><strong>Unaware</strong>: Before Klaglich finds out about the party, she continues her business as usual. She continues supplying the Chancellor, awaits Wasmeier’s instructions in the ruined house, and tries to keep his other servants out of trouble. She spends the rest of her time surreptitiously watching the major NPCs for signs of unexpected behaviour. In this situation, she may even be open to the party hiring her.</p>\n<p>The GM needs to decide when the party’s actions become apparent to Klaglich or @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}. Asking questions around the City Council or Guilds will do it if they’re indiscreet in talking about the taxes and their supporters.</p>\n<p><strong>Observing</strong>: When Brunhilde becomes aware of the party making enquiries, she starts spying on their movements. She adopts one of her disguises and watches them when they’re in public places, such as at the Carnival or the @JournalEntry[JAi2HLfYRkYwLC63]{Templar’s Arms}. A <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test reveals that someone is following or watching them.</p>\n<p><strong>Checking</strong>: Klaglich becomes more suspicious if she knows the Characters have met and discussed tax with any of the NPCs who have a weaker influence on the Graf — those with one influence ‘vote’ (@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Schmiedehammer}, @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Lafarel}, @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Zimperlich}, the @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Midden Marshals}, the @JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{Wizards}, @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}, or @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti}). If this happens, she works to increase the pressure on Ar-Ulric with another visit as Elise Kaltblutig, meets Schmiedehammer to test his hypnosis in the guise of ‘Charlotte’, and checks Ehrlich is still hiding in his house. The Characters could happen across her in any of these situations if they’re in the right place at the right time.</p>\n<p><strong>Thwarting</strong>: If the Characters meet with any of the most influential NPCs (the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina}, or @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Schlagen}) or look to have won more than seven ‘votes’ to influence the Graf, Klaglich takes direct action. She orders @Actor[klwNbpAHe1oQ1oo6]{Dagmar}, @Actor[frMWa4mngN7z7n3g]{Hultz}, or @Actor[eeJoYIenRt8CbtVU]{Anton} to ambush any Character who separates from the party. Wasmeier commands her to initiate one or more of the fallback schemes above, or adopt the role of Zena Kroll to meet the party and throw them off the scent.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovered</strong>: If the Characters discover Klaglich’s identity or follow her back to the ruined house where she is staying with her henchmen and the imprisoned Reya, follow the guidelines on @JournalEntry[n2j6nlkc2s2LcieJ]{The Lair of the Pawns}.</p>","folder":"hQfHL1VS2zKPRt1T","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":200000}}}

Since the fighter is allowed no armour except a shield, only the bravest warriors take part. The @Actor[4iMDGr19M9tUx1SW]{Minotaur} is armed with a two-handed club. This year there are three Minotaurs in prime fighting condition, and in between bouts there will be lesser bouts pitting visiting warriors against captured Beastmen and other creatures. Two of the Minotaurs are already booked; one by the Dwarf @Actor[7qgDlG8BryDHpn4a]{Glugnur} and the other by Alchred von Hintz, a young, impoverished noble from Altdorf. This means that one Minotaur is free should one of the Characters wish to take part.</p>\n<p>While the Minotaurs do their best to kill their opponents, the fighters must @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.Ssod4QuBdyMS6F79]{Pull Their Blows}, which means that their strikes will not cause Critical Wounds. The beast is defeated when its Wounds are reduced to zero, causing it to keel over unconscious for [[/r 1d10]] rounds. The Minotaurs are rewarded with food when they win.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The p</span>rize for winning a fight is a purse equal to sixpence from each person in the crowd, and since a normal crowd is 2000 + (D10x100), the prize can be from 50-75 GCs, though particularly entertaining fights might attract additional coin from an exultant crowd. Ticket prices range from @Pay[2bp]{2 brass pennies} to @Pay[10ss]{10 silver shillings}, depending on the quality — or presence — of the seating. The winner of a Minotaur fight gains general public respect for the duration of the Carnival, and is noticed by the Midden Marshals and by any other major NPCs attending the event.</p>\n<p>If the challenger loses the fight by being reduced to zero Wounds, a number of trained ‘bullies’ leap into the ring.  They try to entice the Minotaur away before it starts eating its victim and enters a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.yRhhOlt18COq4e1q]{Frenzy}. Betting on Minotaur fights is fast and furious, and for outsiders the odds are generally based on species: Dwarfs 2:1; Humans 3:1, Elves 3:1, and Halflings 15:1. Longer odds are rare, since the view is that only good fighters take up the challenge.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[uvx3NKMXnaA1BO9o]{Minotaur Fights}</h4>\n<h3>Bernabau Stadium</h3>\n<h4>This event is attended by the following NPCs</h4>\n<h4><strong>Wellentag</strong></h4>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulric Schutzmann}</p>\n<p>@Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Johann Schwermutt}</p>\n<p>@Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Maximillian von Genscher}.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Matinee of Bards and Poets (2–5 p.m.)</h2>\n<p>Poets and singers from across the Empire compete for the prestigious Graf ’s Cup, a silver chalice awarded each year to the leading competitor.

(7–9:00 p.m.)</h2>\n<p>Synopsis:</p>\n<p>Dulcina and Dulcetta are two sisters who live in the small hamlet of Schweinberg under the yoke of their domineering and evil father, Bastando. Bastando forbids his daughters to marry so they may continue to look after him in his old age. Dulcina is the fairer of the two and is pursued by two local youths, Lysenter and Salacio. Dulcetta, her plain and plumper sister is in love with Salacio, and curses her sister for preventing her affections from being realised.</p>\n<p>Taking pity on the girl, the Goddess Rhya offers the girl a single wish, and Dulcetta asks for her sister to be turned into a pig. However, when granting the wish, Rhya is distracted by her lover Taal, and the spell goes awry: Dulcina does indeed become a pig, but this does nothing to deter Lysenter and Salacio’s amour. They are enraged to find her in the hands of the Butcher, and rescue her. In the climax of Act One, Lysenter and Salacio fight a duel over ‘Dulcina’, allowing Bastando to appear and try to kill the pig he does not know is his daughter. At the last moment, Dulcetta stops the blow, but her explanations do not stop the two men loving the same pig. However, the Old Priest of Sigmar arrives and announces that while a woman may have only one man as his wife, there is no such rule for pigs. Overjoyed, Lysenter and Salacio plan for a double wedding, despite Bastando’s rage at such events.</p>\n<p>Act Two begins with the wedding preparations. Dulcetta, distraught, prays to Rhya to end the situation. Rhya agrees but once again is distracted by Taal and disenchants the men but forgets to turn Dulcina back into a girl. Moments later, the pig herd is gathered by the Butcher once again. Dulcetta begs Lysenter and Salacio to go after Dulcina but they do not believe a pig could be their beautiful love. Dulcetta goes after Dulcina alone, and seeing her sister alone and afraid, softens her heart. The two escape only to run into Bastando, who has come to kill Dulcina for abandoning him, knowing that killing a pig is no crime at all. Dulcetta protects her sister, and just as the blow is falling, the men arrive and Salacio leaps to save her.</p>\n<p>Bastando is defeated, and Salacio realises he loved Dulcetta all along. Lysenter however, is still stuck marrying a pig, and now also wishes to wed Dulcetta. Salacio and the cast remind Lysenter that a pig can still make a good wife. Bastando too sings of the virtue of a good wife, saying that the lack of one is why he sought to keep his daughters to himself, since his wife died so young. Seeing such humility, Rhya relents and turns all of the pig herd into women. Lysenter marries Dulcina, Salacio marries Dulcetta and Bastando marries the very alluring Porcalina. As the rest of the male cast also find brides, they sing of the joy of their wedding day. </p>\n<h3>The Royal Gardens</h3>\n<h4>This event is attended by the following NPCs</h4>\n<p>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich}</p>\n<p>@Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Johann Schwermutt}</p>\n<p>@Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}</p>\n<p>@Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen}</p>\n<p>@Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich}</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<p>@Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Joachim Hoflich}</p>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}</p>","folder":null,"sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

Known for his black moods and erratic temper, folk claim his cult is needed more than any other, for if ever there is a god that must be appeased, it’s Manaan. He’s depicted as an enormous, black-bearded man with seaweed in his hair and a great, five-pointed crown of black iron upon his troubled brow. He’s said to dwell at the bottom of the ocean, the rise and fall of his massive chest forming the waves and tides as the greatest monsters of the deep gather in his court.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Manann is worshipped along coasts throughout the Old World, wherever people make their living from the sea or live close enough for storms and floods to threaten their homes. Even those who know little of Manann will throw a coin or other small treasure into the water before beginning a sea voyage in the hope of a smooth crossing.</p>\n<p>The cult has a significant number of orders, mostly monastic, tasked to guard isolated, sacred islands. The Order of the Albatross is largest, comprised of priests who maintain temples across the Old World and bless merchant or naval vessels with their presence. Often accompanying them, the Order of the Mariner is the military arm of Manann, the cult’s templar-marines, sworn protectors of Marienburg.</p>\n<p>Manann’s clerics usually wear robes of dark greenish-blue or blue-grey, trimmed with a white wave-pattern.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Manann’s temples are found in all coastal towns and cities, and in most river ports where seagoing vessels berth. The high temple is in the great port-city of Marienburg: a huge, lavishly decorated complex open to the tides. The Matriarch of the Sea, head of the Order of the Albatross, is based there, a woman who ostensibly leads the entire cult of Manann, although in practice the sea-god’s clerics are as mercurial as&nbsp; their god, and as likely to be stubborn as to serve.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cult also maintains many monasteries and abbeys on small isolated islands, most dedicated to one of Manann’s many saints.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances from Manann often involve hazardous, maritime pilgrimages, tests of sailing skills, or expeditions against the sea-god’s enemies, especially followers of the heretical cult of Stromfels, God of Pirates, Wreckers, and Sharks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"font-style: normal;\"><strong>Strictures</strong></h3>\n<ul style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n<li>No whistling or swearing when at sea or on holy ground.</li>\n<li>Never harm an albatross.</li>\n<li>First catch to Manann.</li>\n<li>A silver and fish to every Manannite temple and shrine approached.</li>\n<li>Hunt down the servants of Stromfels wherever they may hide.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Blessing of Hardiness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.eBRjKAF6U0yR0KK8]{Blessing of Savagery}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Blessing of Tenacity}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Geo6EAR39JzaP9P2]{Becalm}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.i5DW3xX2lGu6Pps6]{Drowned Man's Face}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.nQ9Fydtqshroi11E]{Fair Winds}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.IKW03JiqXVdDoPA6]{Manann's Bounty}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.VUyCJ5LRPkuC5iZx]{Sea Legs}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iWVQRVDVDCx1SyPA]{Waterwalk}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/manann.webp","folder":"NkiXlTQtgNkW3FMs","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"}}}

{"_id":"2IwaKatBpKLgtBYJ","name":"The Cult of Rhya, Goddess of Fertility","content":"<p><strong>Seat of Power</strong>: None officially</p>\n<p><strong>Head of the Cult</strong>: None</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Orders</strong>: None</p>\n<p><strong>Major Festivals</strong>: Summer Solstice, with equinoxes also celebrated</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Holy Books</strong>: None, though many oral traditions exist Common Holy Symbols: Sheaf of wheat, fruit, spirals</p>\n<p>Bountiful Rhya is the Goddess of Fertility and Summer, widely known as the Earth Mother and She Who Sustains Life. Though typically depicted as the wife of Taal, myths connect her to many gods, and she has children from many of those relationships. Most commonly portrayed as a tall, beautiful women wreathed in leaves and bedecked in fruit, Rhya’s statues are normally nude, pregnant, and surrounded by her children. Many theologians tie Rhya to the Old Faith, a prehistoric cult comprised of ancient farmers and hunters who wrested a living from the land before the Empire was born, and one still found in secluded communities to this day.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Rural folk across the Old World venerate Rhya, relying on her to provide the crops upon which their lives depends. Womanfolk comprise the main body of the cult, and most midwives pay at least lip-service to Rhya’s Wisdom, a set of oral traditions surrounding childbirth. Although she is not openly worshipped in the towns and cities — townsfolk often turning to Shallya in her stead — her name is frequently tied with Taal’s, so she is still well known amongst such people. </p>\n<p>Because the cult has no great temples and protects no holy books or relics of significance, many scholars believe her worship to be declining, and possibly already dead. Her many cultists do nothing to contradict such talk.</p>\n<p>Rhya’s cultists have no fixed vestment or preferred garb, though greens are very common, as is using plants, flowers, or herbs to accessorise any clothing. They often dress in a fashion considered far too revealing by Sigmarite doctrine, which can cause friction as the Rhyans believe giving in to such prudishness is tantamount to encouraging the Prince of Excess into your lives, as it builds forbidden desires. Devotees of Sigmar invariably disagree, believing abstinence and restricting temptation is a better response to such dangers than indulgence.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Rhya has no large temples, though many ancient sites constructed from oghams (standing stones) are centres of worship for her cult, and some still echo each equinox with the cries of fevered celebrants.</p>\n<p>Shrines to Rhya are usually simple statues of the goddess, often piled high with offerings of food and drink. Older shrines are often made of small standing stones marked with worn, spiralled patterns.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Rhyan penances may involve replanting devastated areas, helping broken households, and maintaining sacred groves. It is also common to find Rhyans tasked to protect helpless families, which can often put them at odds with local bailiffs and law enforcement. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>Strictures</strong></em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Defend families, children, and crops from all harm.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never feel shame for the flesh Rhya gave you.</em></li>\n<li><em>Life is sacred, do no harm lest another life is in danger.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never judge whom another loves.</em></li>\n<li><em>Interrupt the work of the Prince of Excess wherever it may thirst</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.maUl7MoLvuvTOhM0]{Blessing of Grace}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.C92dpJPRYpkZFsGu]{Blessing of Healing}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Jkt465WPdRcejLwl]{Blessing of Recuperation}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.qB1T6ii29jreZBRP]{Rhya's Children}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.OiMiQmsv1mut24jD]{Rhya's Harvest}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.25trttu8NxFQQCo9]{Rhya's Shelter}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.pBWXlJDOE7tfl8hP]{Rhya's Succour}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0uT3mzx8v4H3gVQj]{Rhya's Touch}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.dDxhGgBBM9CugxsH]{Rhya's Union}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/rhya.webp","folder":"NkiXlTQtgNkW3FMs","sort":700001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":700001}}}

They usually go around in groups of 2-12. If there's a big game (like the cup competition during the Carnival), there is a 25% chance that the hooligan couldn't get a ticket and so is in a foul mood. The character will be drunk 40% of the time before a match, and 80 % of the time after one.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Performer: The Snakeman.

A highly-skilled charlatan, specialising in fortune telling.</li>\n<li>The Mystical Oracle Zagor. Another fortune\u0002teller, but who has some genuine precognitive ability.

A dramatic presentation of the tale of Sigmar and Artur (see Warhammer City, pp7- 8). This version, however, panders to the local audience and presents Artur’s defeat by Sigmar as a tragic result of betrayal.</li>\n<li>Professor Attenberg’s Marvellous Menagerie. This venerable exhibit has been a fixture at the Carnival for many years, though it is now well past its best.</li>\n<li>Doctor Malthusius’ Zoocopeia. This show is as described in Shadows Over Bögenhafen (p11) and provides the PCs with an opportunity to renew their acquantaince with Malthusius. He has not yet replaced the three-legged goblin and is keen to procure a new attraction. He is interested by the rumours of creatures lurking in the Undercity and will offer a reward for the capture of something suitable for his show.</li>\n<li>Heinrich Liebestrüdel’s Amazing Circus. Liebestrüdel’s show is a variety of traditional entertainments, including acrobats, a strongman, a trick-riding display and a comic show by a group of gnome jesters. It takes place throughout the day on the Eastenders’ snotball pitch in the Altquartier.</li>\n<li>The Kleinmoot Pie Festival. Shops and stalls throughout the Kleinmoot sell all manner of sweet and savoury pies and public spaces host competitions in pie baking, eating and throwing. Children are entertained by adults dressed in the green felt costume and wide-brimmed straw hat of the popular Pie Man character of halfling folklore, who traditionally makes gifts of small sweet pies to children.</li>\n<li>Jakob Händrichs’ Mandolin Experience. Händrichs is a supremely talented itinerant mandolin player, with extensive knowledge of mandolin music from across the Old World. He has been impressing Carnival audiences with his eclectic Liederland show.</li>\n<li>The Chucker Brothers. Sadly this popular dwarf\u0002tossing show (in which a pair of ogres throw dwarf acrobats through the air) is not making an appearance this year. Rumour suggests this is due to the Dwarf Tax, though in reality the group have simply disbanded because of “artistic differences”. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>1. <strong>Pickpockets: </strong>One of the Characters is targeted by a pickpocket (Thief – Brass 3) with Sleight of Hand 45. If thetargeted Character is standing still in the crowd, they may make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test in order to catch them in the act. Otherwise, all the pushing and jostling makes it a <strong>Difficult (–10%) Perception</strong> Test, as it ishard to tell exactly which push or jostle is caused by a pickpocket.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>False Accusations:</strong> An NPC close to the party has just been robbed by a pickpocket, and the Characters findthemselves accused of the crime and surrounded by a press of hostile townsfolk. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm or Intimidate</strong> Test is required before they can move on. Failure may mean the crowd calls the guards, or worse forms an impromptu mob to take care of business themselves!</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Nice Doggy:</strong> To a small dog, a crowd of people is nothing more or less than a forest of ankles to bite and lowerlegs to… well, inconvenience. These small dogs can’t seriously wound anyone — they aren’t vicious after all — but they are quite annoying. Detaching a biting (or otherwise attached) dog from one’s leg requires a full round and asuccessful <strong>Challenging (+0) Agility or Strength</strong> Test.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Trip:</strong> People in a crowd very seldom look at the ground, so it is important to keep one’s feet. Anyone who trips orfalls must make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics</strong> Test to rise before they are trampled, taking 1 Wound in Damage. Armour and Toughness does not reduce this damage.. The Athletics Test must be repeated once per round until successful.</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Lost Child:</strong> A young child has become separated from her family in the crowd, and is forcing her way through,pushing, kicking shins, and howling for her mother. Although no damage is caused, a push or kick requires the victimto make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics</strong> Test or trip and fall, as above. Kind-hearted characters may feelobliged to reunite parent and child, leading to further delays. If you are feeling cruel, the child is a diversion used by a gang of pickpockets (see Pickpockets above), and anyone who tries to help her suffers a further –10 penalty to Perception Tests as they are robbed.</p>\n<p>6. <strong>Every Home Should Have One:</strong> An enterprising tradesman is selling crudely-carved wooden mannequins withthe word ‘witch’ or ‘heretic’ painted across the chest. Each one comes with a handful of straw and kindling in a small bag of coarse cloth. ‘Witches and heretics!’ he cries, ‘Only a shilling each! Take a couple home for the kids! Witches andheretics!’ He wanders through the crowd, and eager buyers shove their way towards him — possibly impeding the Characters as they try to make their own way through the crowd. Given the current religious tensions, some of the‘heretics’ might sport crude hammers of Sigmar painted on their chests. A crowd-pleaser among Middenlanders, these might lead to conflict with visiting Sigmarites.</p>\n<p>7. <strong>Brawl:</strong> A brawl spills into the street from a nearby tavern or side-alley, or breaks out between members of thecrowd. The Characters are in the wrong place at the wrong time, and the expanding fight engulfs them. There isno neutrality — indeed, no concept of friend or foe — as punches, kicks, and chair legs fly in all directions. Each Character is attacked once per round, and must disengage or flee (see WFRP, page 165) to get out of the brawl. After 1d10 rounds, a watch patrol appears, wading into the crowd and arresting everyone they can subdue.</p>\n<p>8. <strong>A Tough Crowd:</strong> There are rules in Power Behind the Throne for handling occasions where an especially poor performance turns a crowd ugly. The Characters run smack into a failed entertainer who is fleeingfrom a small but angry crowd. The Characters must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Dodge</strong> Test to avoid collision and possible trampling; it is almost impossible to avoid the barrage of fruit and dung the crowd is throwing.</p>\n<p>9. <strong>Hot Headed: </strong>As the Characters pass by a fire-eater busking on the street, an ill-timed burst of flame catches the feather on someone’s hat, or some other vulnerable target. They gain one <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Condition[</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Ablaze] Condition.</span></p>\n<p>10.<strong> A Volunteer from the Audience: </strong>One of the Characters is targeted by a group of buskers — clowns, for example,or a knife-thrower’s assistants, or some other act that requires a victim from the audience. They try to drag the Character into their performance, laughing maniacally and refusing to take no for an answer. The Character canexpect a few minutes of danger or humiliation unless they fight their way free, which risks angering the smallcrowd of onlookers and turning the situation into a brawl. As always, there is the chance that one of the troupe is a pickpocket who uses all the manhandling as a distraction.</p>\n<p>11.<strong> Just Dropping In:</strong> An acrobat has stretched a tightrope between the upper-floor windows of two houses, and slips and falls as the Characters are walking beneath the rope. One of the characters chosen by the GM must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics</strong> Test or suffer 1 Wound as the performer falls on them. If they score an Impressive Failure, they take 2 Wounds and the performer is seriously injured. With an Astounding Failure, the performer meets a tragic end. The crowd might take a turn for the worse, thinking the Characters killed the acrobat.</p>\n<p>12. <strong>A Splendid Race:</strong> Two young nobles, fresh from the horse fair on Backertag, are riding their newly purchased mounts through the crowd at a furious speed, having made a bet over who can reach their home in the Grafsmund first. Those who fail to dodge risk being ridden down.</p>\n<p>13. <strong>A Question of Faith:</strong> The Characters pass by a street-corner preacher — a priest, or warrior priest, or even a flagellant — who has gathered a small but enthusiastic crowd through fiery rhetoric. The preacher and the crowdmight be Ulrican or Sigmarite. If one or more Characters has the misfortune to be showing emblems of the opposing deity, one of the preachers points them out with a howl and denounces them as traitors, heretics, and enemies ofall that is good and true. As the crowd turns toward them, fired up by the preacher’s words, the Characters need asuccessful <strong>Difficult (–10) Charm or Intimidate</strong> Test — or a swift exit — if they hope to avoid a beating or worse.</p>\n<p>14. <strong>What Are You Looking At?</strong> The crowds and plentiful drink at the Carnival regularly lead to small disturbances, and the Characters encounter just such a situation. A few townsfolk, drunk and spoiling for a fight, decide that the Characters have offended them somehow. The altercation starts with a couple of rounds of threats and posturing, during which time a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm or Intimidate</strong> Test may calm the situation. If not, things escalate to a brawl (see above) almost instantly.</p>\n<p>15.<strong> The Wrong Colours:</strong> The Middenball competition draws spectators from all over the north to the Bernabau Stadium, and those whose team is not playing roam the city looking for food, drink, and entertainment — which,in some cases, includes fighting. One such group, decked in the colours of their favoured team, spots the Characters and takes exception to a garment that one of them is wearing, which happens to be in the colours of the group’s arch-rivals. Even if the Characters can convince them that they are not rival supporters, they insist that the offending garment is removed immediately and burned in the street, and they are prepared to use force to get their way.</p>\n<p>16. <strong>Look Out Below: </strong>The Characters are walking along a narrow street lined with buildings whose upper storeys jut out almost close enough to touch each other. By an accident of timing, they pass beneath a particular window justas someone is emptying a chamber pot out of it. A cry of ‘Look out below!’ is their only warning.</p>\n<p>17. <strong>A Cry for Justice:</strong> The street ahead is blocked by a dense crowd gathered around an agitator. If you have Middenheim: City of the White Wolf, the agitator might be a New Millennialist, but their cause does not matter. The Characters must push their way through the crowd with an Average (+20) Athletics Test. The crowd is already whipped up to a fever pitch by the agitator’s words and tempers are dangerously high. If a Character scores an Impressive Failure, a brawl breaks out.</p>\n<p>18. <strong>Guilt by Association:</strong> An agitator comes running down the street toward the Characters, pursued by a Watchpatrol. A collision is almost inevitable, and unlucky Characters may even be knocked down, but the agitator is up and running again before the Characters can react, leaving a snowstorm of pamphlets swirling in the air around them. Having lost their quarry, the Watch decides to arrest the Characters instead, for possessing seditious material.</p>\n<p>19. <strong>Poor Sportsmanship: </strong>The Characters — perhaps while chasing one of the many NPCs in Power Behind the Throne — run into the improvised booth of a bunko artist in the middle of a game. They are immediately grappled by the bunko artist’s lookouts, who insist on an outrageous sum in ‘damages’ and look ready to resort to violence. If any Character is a Rogue, there is a chance that the gang assumes that the accident was a poorly disguised attack aimed at taking over their turf.</p>\n<p>20. <strong>The Wisdom of Fools:</strong> A beggar on a street corner notices the Characters. His face is transformed into a maskof shock and wonder as he seems to recognise one of them. This might be the Lieberung character, in keeping withone of the campaign’s major themes, or it might be someone else entirely, just to keep the Characters and the Players guessing. The beggar hauls himself unsteadily to his feet and totters after the Characters, babbling semi-coherentlyand giving the impression that he once served the Character and wants to do so again. If the Characters stop, theycan’t make sense of anything he says and he cannot be induced to do anything useful. He just keeps babbling andfawning. If the Characters decide to ignore him and keep moving, he follows, calling after them in increasingly piteous tones, until they manage to leave him behind. If the Characters seek magical or miraculous healing for hispoor, damaged mind, he does not recognise them when cured, and has no memory of why he fixated on one of them.</p>\n<p>21. <strong>A Regrettable Accident:</strong> Pushing through a crowd, one of the Characters accidentally bumps into a passerbyhard enough to knock them down, perhaps as the result of an impressive failure on an Athletics Test while moving through a Very Crowded area. A middle-class lady’s husband shouts and calls for the Watch, as does anyone who sees them knock down an old person. Alternatively, a martial passerby — perhaps one of Middenheim’s many knights —steps in to teach the culprit some manners.</p>\n<p>22. <strong>Future Champions: </strong>A dozen or so children come running along the street, whacking at each other with sticks in imitation of the contestants they have been watching at the Minotaur fights or the challenges to the Graf ’s Champion. While trying to negotiate this moving obstacle, the Characters suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests relating to shadowing or pursuit — and an exceptionally unlucky Character might also catch a stick in the eye, gaining one <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Condition[</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Blinded] Condition.</span></p>\n<p>23. <strong>The Upper Crust:</strong> A cultural event has recently finished, or is due to start shortly. Possibilities include any eventat the Royal Gardens or the Royal College of Music, especially the Graf ’s garden party on Marktag. Group of gorgeously-dressed nobles and other worthies are making their way to or from the event, taking up the full width ofthe street whether they are on foot or in coaches. In either case, they are accompanied by an escort of guards whose only duty is to push anyone and everyone out of the way, including the Characters. An NPC whom the Charactersare following just manages to dodge past the nobles, leaving the guards especially determined not to let anyone elsepass.</p>\n<p>24. <strong>Student Larks:</strong> A small group of students from the Collegium Theologica rampage drunkenly through the crowd, throwing firecrackers or casting petty magic to their own immense amusement, and the annoyance of everyone else.</p>","folder":null,"sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"2aOu8k1gNO1UgasZ","name":"Siegfried Prunkvoll","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/siegfried-prunkvoll.webp\" width=\"252\" height=\"255\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>As Siegfried loves to explain, the post of Knight Eternal has its origins in distant history. As he tells it, when Middenheim was first founded, a soothsayer predicted that the city must always be protected by a knight of great virtue and selflessness, selected by the most honest and brilliant men of the city. At once, a volunteer stepped forward; the people rejoiced and awarded him a stipend from the city’s coffers. The Knight Eternal — since such a protector would be needed for all time — was also given a magnificent white suit of magical plate mail created by the city’s wizards. Handed down from one Knight Eternal to the next, this armour became a badge of office.</p>\n<p>The first Knights Eternal were fine warriors, although it has been claimed that the first one just happened to be the soothsayer’s son, who was unemployed at the time. The post has lost much of its glory over the centuries, but no one wants to end the tradition. Siegfried actively campaigned for the post while the last Knight Eternal was struggling with a fatal illness, and succeeded largely for want of any better candidate.</p>\n<p>No court functions or duties are attached to the post, except that according to the prophecy, the Knight Eternal must always remain within Middenheim’s walls or a terrible fate will befall the city. Siegfried has no influence on @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris}.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Siegfried lives in the Outer Palace, but attends certain cultural events during Carnival week. He does not frequent informal or lowbrow events, markets, or other ‘common’ locations.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>A Character of high social class (for instance, in the Noble Career, or possessing the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.1IVGksL10N7GVrw3]{Noble Blood} Talent) who is well dressed and well spoken — or a lesser Character who can convincingly imitate these qualities — receives a bonus of up to +20 on all Fellowship Tests with Siegfried. Grimy, uncouth, and even plain spoken individuals are dismissed out of hand.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Siegfried knows nothing of any value, and talking to him will be a complete waste of time; persistent players may take a little while to realise this. If he detects the slightest whiff of any threat to Middenheim’s security, Siegfried will consider it his sacred duty to march in to the Graf and tell him all, and will insist that the Characters accompany him. He will not listen to any arguments in favour of delay, or gathering further information, or avoiding tipping the enemy off. The only way to stop him will be by force — which will convince him that the Characters, too, are part of a terrible plot to destroy the city.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Siegfried has little idea of who influences Graf Boris. He thinks, wrongly, that he has significant influence, and he believes that the @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Marshals} have more influence than they actually do. He refuses to believe that any female NPC could possibly have any influence over the Graf, clothing his chauvinistic views in pompous and mealy-mouthed chivalry.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>In his simplistic and misinformed way, Siegfried is devoted to his post and to Middenheim. While he regards financial discussions as sordid, he may reveal that he dislikes the Temple Tax, but is in favour of the other two: Dwarfs are inherently less noble than Humans, and wizards less noble than knights or priests.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>Siegfried is completely unaware that most other NPCs find him tedious or even ridiculous. In most cases, his opinions are based on the rank rather than the person.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam}— Chancellor</strong>: A good enough fellow, sound on antiques and history. Unfortunate that he must soil his hands with financial matters.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: A fine fellow, doing his best despite his low birth. When they meet, Siegfried’s forced display of good-fellowship is embarrassing.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Fine songs are well and good for diverting the ladies, but Siegfried doesn’t care for an Elf moving so freely among court’s feminine flowers.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘The Princess’</strong>: The highest lady in the land and a paragon of virtue. Siegfried attempts courtly compliments and the occasional dreadful poem, blind to their invariably disastrous results.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: A fine, dutiful lady. Their relationship is highly formal, perfectly mannered, and quite excruciatingly polite.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Fine fellows and great warriors, though lacking his own heroic qualities. Siegfried is quite unaware of their dislike of him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Sorcery is rather unchivalrous, though of course a wizard made his wonderful plate mail. Janna Eberhauer makes him uncomfortable — there is a term for female spellcasters, and it is not Deputy High Wizard.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: As a devoted follower of Sigmar, Siegfried is concerned that a priest of Ulric has the Graf ’s ear, even if that priest is also an Imperial Elector. However, he hardly knows Ar-Ulric, and will not criticise him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Siegfried treats them all with a condescending and impersonal chivalry. He is unaware of any affairs, and will be unable to process the information if he is told. However, he has failed to banish the memory of one lady (Petra, though he could not name her) making an improper suggestion to him despite his vow of chastity; rather than think her naturally capable of such sentiments, he puts the incident down to some aspect of the moons. He has heard that ladies are affected by such things.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Allavandrel has been abusive to Siegfried in the past, and the Knight Eternal loathes him. It is bad enough that the Graf must hunt with ragged countrymen, but an Elf in the hunt — as something other than quarry — is beyond bearing.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Knights do not consort with leech-handlers.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: No contact, but they are surely learned and worthy fellows, if bookish and dull.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Thinks him a fine servant and a credit to the court, but obviously one does not become familiar with a servant. What was the fellow’s name again?</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Prunkvoll drones on about history to Mueller, assuming she knows basically nothing and will benefit from his educating her.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>He has some respect but little time for the Cult of Shallya, which he dismisses as ‘a woman’s religion’.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, <em>@JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{A Knight’s Midsummer Dream}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Horse Fair}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants and Jousting}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 1)}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 2)}</em>, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>\n<h3>Siegfried at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>Between his scheduled activities, Siegfried often wanders the streets, letting the common folk see him and be comforted by his presence. If the party becomes involved in some small fracas — in one of the better parts of town, of course — the Knight Eternal may intercede. Most thugs flee when he appears, even those hired by another major NPC to ambush the Characters. If they suspect that the encounter has been staged by the Knight Eternal, a few minutes of conversation should convince them this cannot possibly be cunning… could he?</p>\n<p>The key to Siegfried’s good graces is his naïve vanity. If the Characters are, or can pretend to be, impressed by his position, devoted to the ideals of chivalry, and sufficiently well-born to merit his attention, they can flatter him into almost complete pliability. This of course, leads most of the other major NPCs to regard the Characters with a level of contempt similar to their low opinion of the Knight himself. They will quickly discover that he has no friends, very little influence, and absolutely no knowledge of value. He is also about the most irritating person with whom one could ever hope to spend an evening.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: If sufficiently flattered and manipulated, Siegfried happily demonstrates his position and influence — or rather, the position and influence that exist only in his own imagination — by furnishing the Characters with florid but beautifully-scribed letters of introduction to anyone in the city. As a demonstration of his spectacular vanity and lack of judgement, this includes the Graf himself. However, anyone presenting such letters to another major NPC starts off with a –20 penalty to all <strong>Fellowship </strong>Tests in the first interview, being tainted by association with this overblown fop. @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Zimperlich} the Chaperone is the only exception.

{"_id":"2jOnMEHS9Xt26AQ7","name":"Dwarfs","content":"<p>Dwarfs — or ‘Dawi’ as they call themselves — are legendarily gruff and stubborn. While the majority reside in vast mountainside fortresses known as Holds, most larger towns and the capital of the Reikland also have Dwarf populations. Given their clannish nature, they tend to band together, forming enclaves or districts wherever they settle. Many of the Dwarfs living in Reikland are the descendants of those driven from Fallen Holds many centuries ago, but most still consider themselves as Dwarfs of the Grey Mountains, although some have never seen a hill, let alone a mountain.</p>\n<p>Dwarf culture respects skill in crafting — chiefly stonework, smithing and engineering — and Dwarf Holds are resplendent with impressive feats of artifice. They also covet gold and jewels, mining deep beneath the mountains in the pursuit of precious metals and gemstones. However, more than these material possessions, Dwarfs venerate their elders and ancestors, and have entire religions focussing upon important progenitors. Dwarfs cannot cast spells, although their runesmiths carve artefacts with intricate runes to harness magical power. </p>\n<p>However, their prowess as engineers is so impressive that some of their more ingenious clockwork or steam-powered devices are mistaken for magic by simpler folk. </p>\n<p>Dwarfs are squat with thick, muscular limbs and stout, broad torsos. Their features are heavy and their hair is thick. Length of hair is a mark of pride and status amongst Dwarfs, with elaborate braids and adornments demonstrating rank: to shave a Dwarf causes terrible shame. Indeed, honour is a  fundamental aspect of their character. Given their long memories and proud natures, they bear grudges against those who have slighted or dishonoured them, gripping tight to their grievances for many years, even taking on the grudges borne by their ancestors, knowing their forebears will be watching over them, nursing their bitterness long after death. Whilst it might be hard for others to win a Dwarf ’s friendship, once given it is absolute. While not as ageless as the near-immortal Elves, Dwarfs can live for many centuries. Indeed, some say that as long as a Dwarf has a purpose, they will not die unless struck down in battle, such is the strength of their conviction.</p>\n<h3>Opinions</h3>\n<h4>On Reiklander Humans…</h4>\n<p><em>‘Like my father and my father afore me, I’ve been living in Reikland all me life.

If they don't, she will be out of commission for the rest of the evening.</p>\n<p>At this point, heads turn at an offended outcry from the reception room.

Dieter moves in high society because of what, not who, he is, but Graf Boris has always liked him, and he has modest influence (1 vote).</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Dieter is an easily accessible NPC. The easiest way of meeting the champion is to challenge him (see @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Carnival Events: Square of Martials}), but he attends many other events, and is often to be found wandering around markets, attending performances, etc. His carousing is limited by his need to be fighting fit on most mornings, when he may have to defend his title as the Graf ’s Champion. </p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: +5 to all Fellowship Tests. Dieter regards them as doughty fighters, worthy of respect.</p>\n<p><strong>Warriors</strong>: +10 to all Fellowship Tests made by Gold-status characters with at least one completed Warrior Career level.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Dieter and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} are engaged, they discuss people and events (which is how Dieter knows the latest gossip from the Ladies at Court). Also, Dieter has been hypnotised (see below) into speaking out in favour of the tax changes. In addition, Dieter remembers @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} the Minstrel enthusing about the Dwarf Tax.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Dieter thinks that the Midden Marshals have more influence with the Graf than they actually do; this is because his own conversations with the Graf — before his decline — have mostly been about military matters.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Dieter’s main goal is to marry his fiancée, @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} of the Ladies at Court. He plans to settle down as a blacksmith and horse-trader, have a family, and live a comfortable but quiet life. He will not miss high society with its gossip and back-biting, so the Characters must appeal to his sense of injustice and hatred of corruption if they wish to draw him into the developing intrigues.</p>\n<p>Dieter has been hypnotised to express enthusiasm for all of the tax changes if asked. <strong>Note</strong>: This contradicts his expressed admiration for Dwarfs, which — along with his parrot-like repetition of the responses he has been taught under hypnosis — may arouse suspicion.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Indifferent; hardly knows him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</strong> <strong>— Minstrel</strong>: A good friend and drinking companion. Dieter has a fondness for music. He tries to cheer Rallane up when needed, and commiserates with him when the Elf has had another of his unfortunate affairs. The two often go drinking with Allavandrel, Master of the Hunt.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</strong> <strong>— ‘Princess’</strong>: Very correct in his behaviour towards her. They do not meet often. He likes her, but thinks she is not too bright. Nonetheless, he will be slightly jealous of anyone who wins her affections, although he will try not to show it.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich}</strong> <strong>— Chaperone</strong>: He is oddly fond of the old dragon.  He is highly chivalrous towards her, gently teasing her formality in ways that make her smile. He knows she loves her charge, and that she has made many sacrifices for the Todbringer family over the years.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Dieter has friends in the military, but not in high places; he has trained many of those rising to prominence, and has good connections with them. He rarely meets the Marshals, but is sure they are honest and capable.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: No dealings with them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Knows him only indirectly, through court functions. While a few warrior friends revere Ulric, Dieter is not especially religious; he respects the title, but does not know the man.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: He has escorted her to court functions in past years (as is the case with all the Ladies at Court) and likes her. He does not know of her relationships with Graf Boris or Ar-Ulric.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: He is engaged to Kirsten Jung, and is wholly committed to her. He has often escorted all of the three Ladies at Court and likes them all; he won’t hear a word against them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</strong> <strong>— Knight Eternal</strong>: Thinks he is pompous and not much of a warrior, but won’t readily admit this in conversation. Defends him against criticism with equivocal excuses, but tries to avoid him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}</strong> <strong>— Master of the Hunt</strong>: Good friends. They enjoy friendly competitions, jousting, and archery, and often attend Carnival Week events together, often with Kirsten and/or Rallane Lafarel. Dieter worries that Allavandrel can sometimes be impulsive.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}</strong> <strong>— Komission Convenor</strong>: Wallenstein swindled Dieter over a pair of horses two months ago; he could not prove anything, and this still annoys him. Dieter remains convinced that Wallenstein is corrupt.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Knows him only by reputation: so strong opinions, but suspects he may be a quack, using Baron Stefan’s condition to advance his own social status.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Dieter has very few dealings with them, although he thinks them able enough people. He feels sorry for the painfully shy Reiner Ehrlich, but he has no particular feelings about the other two. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer:</strong> Met Sascha once when visiting a horse trader. He couldn’t quite work out why he was there, but they got on well enough.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Dieter is polite about Breugal when speaking to others, and when dealing with him in person. Privately, though, he thinks he is a little drunk on the power he has over the Graf ’s household, and would do better to see people as people, and not simply as the sum of their status and position.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Has a surprisingly congenial relationship with Edel. The role of Judicial Champion is technically a legal position and he was interested enough to ask Mueller about it. He finds her a little wry, but more engaging than he expected.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>He admires the High Matriarch’s quiet devotion to helping those in need and has made some small donations, but when they meet he has little to say to her.</p>\n<h3>Deadly Secret: Hypnotised!</h3>\n<p>While out drinking two months ago, Dieter found himself alone with a pretty woman who called herself Charlotte (actually a heavily disguised @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich}). As the two sat in a secluded tavern booth, she hypnotised him. Ever since then, Dieter repeats one of the following lines whenever the subject of taxes comes up: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘I think the Temple Tax is a good idea. Those priests have been stacking up gold for years. Look at the Temples!’</p>\n<p>‘Everyone knows the Wizards have chests of gold put away, and the Alchemists actually make the stuff!' </p>\n<p>'Dwarfs are thrifty people, very good with gold. They can afford to pay a little more.’</p>\n<p>‘The city needs the money, and those who can pay should pay.’</p>\n<p>‘Not the taxes again! Let’s talk about something else. What did you do yesterday?’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No matter how many times these phrases are repeated, Dieter’s tone does not vary in the slightest.</p>\n<p>If the Characters can undo the hypnosis (see @JournalEntry[m2iCtJ3eBsUwP0Dd]{You Are Feeling Sleepy...}), they will gain an ally with some influence. Alternatively, one of them might defeat Dieter in combat to replace him as the Graf ’s Champion (see @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Carnival Events: Square of Martials}).</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Barnumble’s Incredible Elephant Show}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Horse Fair}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Dwarven Valley Choirs}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 3}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Semi-final 2}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Final}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>\n<h3>Dieter at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>The best way to encounter Dieter is by making a good impression at the @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{challenges}. Another option, almost as good, would be to run into him at the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{horse fair}. If the Character can  talk knowledgeably about horses: Dieter is a good judge of horseflesh, and hopes to become a blacksmith, and horse trader after he retires as the Graf ’s champion.</p>\n<p>Dieter can be encountered at other Carnival events, as shown on his NPC card. The best of these, for engineering a casual encounter, are the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{festival of fine ales} and the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{garden party}. At both, Dieter may be found slightly drunk, in the company of friends, and possibly debating the taxes with other NPCs — who find his attitude puzzling. He may even be in a heated argument with one or more Dwarfs, wizards, priests, or others affected by the taxes: as tempers run high, the Characters have a chance to calm the situation, which wins them the gratitude of Dieter and his closest friends — especially @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten}.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: If the Characters make a favourable impression on Dieter, he can introduce them to his circle of friends, which consists of @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}, @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}, and @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}. He can also provide introductions to the other Ladies-at-Court, including @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}. If the Characters seem respectable enough, he might also be persuaded to introduce them to @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich}, the Chaperone.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/dieter-schmiedehammer.webp","folder":"YbdT1wAfqZmWtR79","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}

{"_id":"3OAZM8M36mkHMmyf","name":"Endeavours","content":"<p>In-between adventures, you have a selection of activities you can undertake — these are known as Endeavours. You may undertake a maximum of one Endeavour per week you are not adventuring, and you may attempt a maximum of three Endeavours in total, regardless of how long the gap between adventures may be. The rest of your time, whether it be weeks, months, or years, is taken up with living your life in relative peace — whatever that may to look like to your character. </p>\n<p>While most of these Endeavours can be attempted by anyone, some are better suited to a particular Class or Career.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Year In, Year Out</p>\n<p>If the period between adventures is particularly long, you can discuss with the GM how to lengthen the narrative scope of your Endeavours. For instance, if you want to commission a new sword with the Commission Endeavour, you may first have to find a skilled smith, then the correct materials, then wait for other commissions to be completed, then maybe your sword is stolen, and so it goes on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Money To Burn</strong></h3>\n<p>After you’ve rolled on the @Table[event], you can spend the money earned during your last adventures using the normal rules. Then, after completing your Endeavours, all money held by your character is considered spent. All of it. The silver lifted from a Burgher’s purse? Gone. The booty liberated from pirates? Also gone. That Troll hoard you raided? Gone, too. All of it.</p>\n<p>What happened to it? It was spent, stolen, drunk, gambled, used for repairs, to pay off debts or taxes, given as a charitable donations or votive offerings, spent on bribes, or used in whatever other way you prefer. You should concoct the best story for what happens to those funds, as it explains a lot about your character.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep some of your hard-won coin to use in the future, you should undertake the @JournalEntry[If8o9wgSOggLiHCV]{Banking} Endeavour. If you want money at the beginning of the next adventure —honestly, or otherwise, depending on your Career — you should undertake the @JournalEntry[lRWvy2uSVgq4RADa]{Income} Endeavour.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Duties &amp; Responsibilities</strong></h3>\n<p>You may lose one or more of your Endeavours due to your Career or Species. </p>\n<h4><strong>With Great Power…</strong></h4>\n<p><em>‘The common folk will never understand my burdens. The sheer weight of the duties I bear. The guilty will not judge themselves and there are always so many villages to cleanse, for our enemies are legion.’ </em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Lothar Metzger, Witch Hunter</em></p>\n<p>As you climb the ranks of your career, you accrue expectations and responsibilities that cannot be avoided. Noble Lords must see to the affairs of their estates, Guildmasters must oversee their guild’s work, and Watch Captains must watch their watchmen. If you neglect your responsibilities, you will soon lose status amongst your peers.</p>\n<p>If you have attained one of the top two tiers of your Career Path and do not undertake the Income Endeavour, which reflects taking care of your obligations, you drop one level within your Career; reverting from the fourth level to the third, or the third to the second. This costs no Experience Points, acting as a free Career change, albeit downwards.</p>\n<p>With this step backwards in your Career Path, you will now have a lower Status, and will earn less money should you perform future @JournalEntry[lRWvy2uSVgq4RADa]{Income} Endeavours. See @JournalEntry[uOqWtxfjRN3BfC2z]{Status} for more information. The loss in status does not remove any Advances acquired while you were in your previous Career.</p>\n<p>If you wish to reclaim your lost Career level, you must once again pay the XP cost to re-enter the higher level of your Career and retake your ‘proper’ place in society. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4><strong>Elf Improvement</strong></h4>\n<p><em>‘There are times when I can barely stand Altdorf. It is not the stench — though that is abhorrent — it is not the noise, either — it is just that you are all so very ugly to look upon, I feel that I must gaze at something beautiful for a time or I know that I shall start screaming, and never stop.’</em> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Irlianmaris Ellarel, Asur Envoy</em></p>\n<p>Elves, even those resident within the borders of Empire, do not consider themselves citizens of the Empire. There are High Elves with diplomatic positions in Karl-Franz I’s court, as well as traders and merchant princes in many of the great cities of the Empire, but the majority of the Asur avoid entanglements with Humans (not to mention Dwarfs) and few would call a Reiklander ‘friend’. </p>\n<p>The Wood Elves are even more removed; nearly mythical, rarely seen, and when they do appear they always have their own concerns that they rarely share with others.</p>\n<p>Between adventures, all Elven characters must undertake one Endeavour maintaining contact with their own kind, seeing to their responsibilities to their people. High Elves commonly give reports on interesting things they’ve learned to agents of Ulthuan in either Altdorf or Marienburg, whereas Asrai do the same with the spies from their arboreal homes. This Endeavour offers no advantage beyond the inherent advantage of being an Elf. Note: Elves only lose an Endeavour if the Between Adventures section is at least 3 weeks long, thus the Elves have at least 3 Endeavours to complete.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\"><strong><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Elf Esteem</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">You will note high-ranking Elven characters who do not wish to lose Career status will only be able to undertake a single ‘free’ Endeavour. This is intentional, designed to offset some of the innate advantages Elven Characters receive, as well as reflecting the prolonged time it takes the long-lived Elves to adapt to change.  Of course, if you feel this is unfairly penalising an Elf character, or making the game less fun, ignore one or both restrictions. </span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"5PMBVwnydUMSobIr","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Endeavours"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.wPkMWDVlNfkbDgxf"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Endeavours","sort":200001}}}

Rickard is dressed in a black and gold tunic, which is cunningly sewn to look like chain mail, and has a golden fox-fur about his shoulders and a mask fashioned like the visor of a helmet. If the Characters are working for him, they will already be briefed to watch out for the schemes of the other Noble Houses, and to do everything in their power to protect the good Aschaffenberg name.</p>\n<p>He arrives with Ludmilla von Aschaffenberg and Markgraf Tobias von Aschaffenberg in a plain white and a half-mask respectively.</p>\n<p>Heinrich and Rickard avoid each other until Lord @Actor[CVrWIrYKaUTjVQVS]{Maximilian von Aschaffenberg} is announced some five minutes later. Maximilian is Rickard’s nephew and has long hated the Bruners, and not just because Bruner Palace is significantly larger Aschaffenberg Manor. He is dressed in black and blue Bruner colours, with a fake tentacle of stuffed and painted cloth protruding from one shoulder and a brightly coloured mutant mask. Angry words are immediately exchanged as Lord Heinrich takes exception to this outrage. If the Characters are hired by the Aschaffenbergs, their cause will suffer unless Maximilian can be persuaded to leave, and possibly return in a more suitable costume. Not only are the Bruners enormously rich and influential, and it is just unseemly to air problems in such a fashion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Actor[CwyPveyQd25d7g8m]{Heinrich von Bruner} - Dining Room</li>\n<li>@Actor[ltflgc6DUMbIwlNn]{Lady Galina Hohengolfrid} - Dining Room</li>\n<li>@Actor[r3eRbNogJrj5IDOi]{Gutele von Bruner - New} - Reception Room</li>\n<li>@Actor[m72VYyUBnBXmKfGH]{Boniel von Bruner} - Reception Room</li>\n<li>@Actor[JNIcLe9AuShIBmMx]{Moritz} - Dining Room</li>\n<li>@Actor[oGGYslnjwgwVnJ9O]{Rickard von Aschaffenberg} - Gallery</li>\n<li>@Actor[ml2iESy70xoV60Bf]{Ludmilla von Aschaffenberg (nee Bruner)} - Gallery</li>\n<li>@Actor[CL2PM83t9oPpZOXC]{Markgraf Tobias von Aschaffenberg (Party)} - Reception Room</li>\n<li>@Actor[CVrWIrYKaUTjVQVS]{Maximilian von Aschaffenberg} - Dining Room</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>7:30 p.m.</h2>\n<p>Lord @Actor[dTmgMasQMmsMR2hV]{Siegfried von Saponatheim} is announced as he arrives alongside his staff.

Halflings are also a common sight in many of Reikland&rsquo;s villages, where it is not uncommon to find them employed to staff an inn or run a farm. They are communal creatures, preferring to live in close-knit family groups, sharing houses, rooms,and even beds with dozens of friends and relatives; everyone contributes and everyone shares. This interdependent lifestyle leaves many Halflings struggling with the concept of private ownership and space.</p>\n<p>Halflings are notoriously interested in recording their lineage, and many Halfling clans can trace their ancestry back many centuries to the very founding of the Mootland (their self-governed Grand Province in the Empire).

{"_id":"3gMb9oLfh3ng7KOE","name":"NPCs With Character","content":"<p>More than any other aspect of <strong>WFRP</strong>, your creation and enacting of memorable NPCs is what will bring the Old World to life. Unforgettable NPCs help create the impetus to roleplay and cause Players to become invested in what happens to them, and by extension, their own Characters. Not every NPC needs to be a tour de force of personality, but a few &lsquo;shining stars&rsquo; go a long way towards filling the firmament with light &ndash; or darkness, as the case may be.</p>\n<p>Every NPC you introduce into an adventure should be there for a purpose, which can vary wildly from &lsquo;background scenery&rsquo; to &lsquo;biggest bad-guy&rsquo; and everything in-between. Some you may place specifically because they can assist the characters or spur them onward by offering something valuable, e.g. knowledge, training, equipment &ndash; in exchange for something the Characters can offer them, e.g. investigative skill, money, directed violence. Others serve as potential antagonists or definite enemies, and consider having a few just because they&rsquo;re fun for you to play and your Players to enjoy.</p>\n<p>The following are the building blocks of an unforgettable NPC. You don&rsquo;t have to put as much detail into an NPC destined to be a &lsquo;prop&rsquo;, but that said, remain flexible. With practice, you may find that you create even minor NPCs memorable enough that your Players will occasionally promptly latch onto one, and even though you originally intended them to be nothing more than a bit of background flavour, they&rsquo;ll soon be dragged into the Characters&rsquo; adventures. Fortunately, <strong>WFRP </strong>has a designator for such folks &ndash; they make <em>excellent </em>Henchmen.</p>\n<p><strong>A Name</strong> &ndash; A decent name will do, but a really good name will stick in the mind. It will likely help you to create a small list of names in advance, checking them off as they get used. That way, if you have to come up with a name &lsquo;on the fly&rsquo; when the Characters insist on learning all about the innocuous barkeep, you won&rsquo;t have to fumble for one. Keep in mind that other points from later in this list may well be referred to in an NPC&rsquo;s name, especially if they are rare. There are a lot of forgettable &lsquo;Karls&rsquo; in the Empire, but &lsquo;Crimson Karl&rsquo; the gent that&rsquo;s eternally bright beet-red in the face from yelling? He&rsquo;ll stick out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong>Use the `/name` command to generate a name! <br />e.g. `/name human male` `/name welf male` `/name helf female`</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Appearance </strong>&ndash; What does the NPC look like? Some folks think they need to put a lot of detail into this, but really, too many details and your Players will just lose track, especially if you have a lot of NPCs. Always note species, but then, try to stick to, at the very most, two or three solid details that stand out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Height, weight, eye colour, and so forth, only need to be noted if they are unusual. Scars, odd tattoos, eccentric clothing choices, weird trappings, the fact they always carry a bedraggled cat with a tiny peg leg &ndash; these are the things people notice and Players remember.</p>\n<p><strong>Mannerisms </strong>&ndash; This is a big category, for it covers style of speech, personality traits, unusual quirks of behaviour, and how the NPC regularly deals with other folk. When determining how an NPC regularly acts, be wary of regularly using stereotypes &ndash; not every Dwarf is grumpy and short-tempered, but that said, there is a reason for that stereotype. A general note for an NPCs outward behaviour will often suffice. Are they friendly, taciturn, impatient, hostile?</p>\n<p>Think about what the NPC&rsquo;s voice sounds like. Especially if their voice sounds nothing like yours, it is okay to tell your Players what the NPCs voice may remind them of. If you want to do a different accent for a specific NPC and feel comfortable doing so, awesome, but be wary of giving strange voices to many NPCs, especially if they hurt your throat to do them. Instead, try playing with your vocabulary, speak in short sentences, using small words for a slow-witted Ogre; speak swiftly, on the edge of breathlessness, for a flighty Halfling.</p>\n<p>A quick search of the internet will yield more lists of example personality traits and quirks of behaviour than you can sic a small but vicious dog on. There are, in fact, whole websites dedicated to such and they can serve as inspiration, but be sure to consider how your Players, and their Characters, will react to certain traits &ndash; they are unlikely to want to deal a lot with someone really annoying (which, honestly, might be fun for you if they have to, for a time).</p>\n<p><strong>Career</strong> &ndash; What the NPC ostensibly does for a living. Most folk in the Old World are completely tied to their Class and Career and can generally afford to do very little outside of them, unless they are of a higher status with enough wealth to let them &lsquo;indulge&rsquo; in different pastimes. Many NPCs may well have had a different Career at one point, but only a few rare ones will have ever jumped between different Classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Unusual Qualities</strong> &ndash; This is a catch-all for traits others wouldn&rsquo;t suspect in the NPC. Particularly high levels of skill, Talents from outside their Career, strange knowledge, Traits from the Bestiary, and so on. Most NPCs should only have one or two Unusual Qualities at most, if any. Note that &lsquo;mutations&rsquo; generally fall under &lsquo;Problems&rsquo;.</p>\n<p><strong>Drives </strong>- Whole plots are driven by these most basic questions: What does the NPC want? What are they prepared to do to get it? Like Characters, important NPCs should have ambitions, though not every ambition has to be realistic. A low-born NPC may aspire to be a Baron one day. This is naught but a weirdroot dream for most folk, but society is changing in the Empire, and a driven merchant, or perhaps a crime lord, with the right connections might just achieve such a lofty goal. Your Characters will certainly have wanted to help such an individual along their way, or perhaps, did everything they could to stop them&hellip;</p>\n<p><strong>Problems </strong>&ndash; Finally, any NPC you know will interact with the Characters should have a problem or two that the Characters might be able to help them with, or take advantage of, which may, or may not, tie into their ambitions. Try to think of problems with multiple potential solutions, e.g. an NPC that has something the Characters desperately want, desires to advance in their Trade Guild, but feels trapped and doesn&rsquo;t know how to. Depending on the Characters&rsquo; skill sets, they could spread gossip about the superior nature of the NPC&rsquo;s wares, sabotage or kill their competition, bribe their superiors, etc. Some problems should actually be &lsquo;secrets&rsquo; which may, or may not, have an actual solution, e.g. hidden mutations, holding to a forbidden faith, an unrequited love, etc. Most such problems can&rsquo;t be &lsquo;solved&rsquo;, but they&rsquo;re ripe for blackmail.</p>\n<h2>Sample NPCs</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.ePPk15Vxu9RxPtYV]{Dieter K&auml;segeier, Cheesemonger Extraordinaire}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Rs3lMA5UavTlTiJW]{Kastor Erichson, Jumpy Hunter}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.nRJxtciIhTHKqAvY]{Stellemar, Loyal Hound}</strong></p>","folder":"5lgcrfb3I58JxD8Y","sort":400001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"}}}

Although he may have escaped, and a city gate and viaduct may have been devastated in the process, it is clear that the cult of the Purple Hand in Middenheim has suffered a terrible blow. The Watch take time to process documents found in Wasmeier’s house, an in the coming weeks raids in search of any remaining cultists intensify. Wasmeier, assuming he has survived the climax of the adventure, is licking his wounds and wondering how to inveigle himself back into society. Whilst he is a depraved follower of Tzeentch he has no desire to freeze and die in a northern wasteland - using the powers of Chaos to make himself comfortable within the echelons of Imperial power and majesty was the plan, after all. Many Purple Hand henchmen will be slain, and the Ordo Terribilis gutted, but the other two Ordos in Middenheim go to ground and weather the initial witch hunts. The Purple Hand through the rest of the Empire are unphased — indeed many of hear of @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier's} failure will smirk at his failed ambition and continue on their own plans, which will soon bear fruit.</p>\n<p>It is with a well-deserved sense of achievement, then, that the Characters return to @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{the Palace} to make their report. The Graf is clearly in their debt, and though the gratitude of royalty is fleeting, the immediate future holds the promise of great reward. When the Characters return from their attempt to apprehend Wasmeier they are met by a clearly impressed @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann} (if Schutzmann has been killed or compromised during the adventure one of the other Midden Marshals or @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} steps in). He shows concern for their wellbeing and sends for medical assistance if any of them are badly hurt. He suggests that they get some rest and refreshment and meet him the next afternoon at the @JournalEntry[uv75n0ftS1SPIHeA]{Laughing Jackass} so that he can debrief them. On a <strong>Difficult (-10) Intuition</strong> Test the Characters may get the impression that he is feeling guilty.</p>\n<h3>The Debrief</h3>\n<p>The next morning @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} meets the Characters and ensures that they are provided with refreshments before launching into a prolonged and exhaustive interogation them about their time in Middenheim. You may describe much of this in the abstract, but put each of the following questions to at least one of the Characters in turn, giving all a chance to answer at least one query — Schutzmann will be comparing their stories, after all.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who the Characters are and where have they come from?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>How did they come to know about the Purple Hand?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>What is their experience with the Purple Hand, and what do they know of the cult’s organisation and activities.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Given that Wasmeier’s body is yet to be recovered do they have any idea what may have become of him and where he may have gone?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Do the following terms mean anything to the Characters: 'Ordo Terribilis', 'Ordo Novitiae', 'Ordo Impedimentae', 'Magister Magistri', and 'The Nuln Cell?' Schutzmann's officers have made some progress in decoding Wasmeier's notes and journals, which is where Schutzmann learned the terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FLIPPING THE SCRIPT</em></h3>\n<p><em>Curious Characters will have their own questions for @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann}</em><em>, some of which have been anticipated below. Schutzmann is pleased with their efforts in defence of the city, and will attempt to answer most reasonable questions.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If the characters show Schutzmann the letter they found in Wasmeier’s house he will look at it for a few seconds before explaining that the letter uses one of the groups easier codes, and can be deciphered by reading the letters after every underlined letter.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>If the Characters bring up the von Wittgensteins Schutzmann listens respectfully, but warns against the repetition of unsubstantiated slanders against Reikland nobility.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>If they mention Gotthard Wallenstein, he assures the Character's that his agents will look into it.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>If he knows anything about their encounters with Skaven he will take as much information as he can.

He suggests that, as capable and resourceful investigators, the Characters enter into an agreement with him. Provided they remain discrete, and provided they are willing to help him carefully investigate the the threat that the Purple Hand or the Skaven pose to Middenheim, he is willing to put certain material resources of the city watch at their disposal.</p>\n<p>Should they think to ask, the Characters will be provided with whatever non-magical equipment, weaponry or armour they might want. Accomodation at one of Middenheim’s finer hostelries is arranged, and a payment of @Credit[1gc EACH]{1 Gold Crown} a week will be made to each Character. He can be haggled up to @Credit[1gc6ss EACH]{1 GC 6/-} a week, though this lowers his opinion of the Characters.</p>\n<p>If a Character has earned a position as Champion to the Graf due to vanquishing @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} during the carnival @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} points out that the two roles are complementary. Indeed, it would be in the spirit of the Graf ’s Champion to defy threats to Middenheim in this way as long as the Graf has no particular duties he wishes his Champion to perform.</p>\n<h3>Consequences of Carnival Week</h3>\n<p>Middenheim’s high society has been through a dramatic week. The trauma of discovering that one of the city’s chief legislators and trusted courtiers almost usurped the throne in the name of a Ruinous Power inspires both anger and introspection.</p>\n<p>Almost immediately @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric Jarrick Valgeir} resigns and undertakes a lone pilgrimage to the far and freezing north. He never returns. His older brother, @Actor[sn0zk1QV53XMipVw]{Emil Valgeir}, takes on the mantle of Ar-Ulric. He is notably more proactive in the promotion of Ulrican values than Jarrick, and hardline Ulrican rhetoric is openly proclaimed from the pulpit of the High Temple. Due to his elevation Emil can no longer act as Grand Master of Middenheim’s @JournalEntry[gAju4PEyv8GeeJQX]{Order of the White Wolf}, and a grizzled campaigner named Rein Volkhard is takes his place.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Reiner Ehrlich} also retires. Replacements for the three Law Lords are drawn from senior clerks at the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists}, Eberhardt Richter, Erich Kalzbad, and Hannes Brucker. They are sincere, solemn and rather tedious men who take great pains to avoid political entanglements.</p>\n<p>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsum} manages to retain his position as Chancellor following a severe reprimand and orders to seek treatment for his addiction and collaborate in a constructive and respectful way on projects managed by @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}. </p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}, if he retains his title as Champion, soon comes to an agreement with the Graf to take on a suitable protégé and train them to replace him. The new champion is chosen from those who gave Dieter a hard fight during the carnival, and may well be one of the Characters. He and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} are swiftly married. Dieter may occasionally utter strange opinions on taxation if his hypnosis has not been treated.</p>\n<p>After retiring from her courtly duties for a short while @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} leaves Middenheim for Altdorf. She tells anyone who questions her decision that she wishes to make a return to the stage, and regards Altdorf ’s theatrical scene as a promising prospect.</p>\n<p>Baron @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan Todbringer} continues to require the care of physicians. @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}, provided he has not too thoroughly disgraced himself, remains a valued courtier in the eyes of most of Middenheim’s high society.</p>\n<p>Baron @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich Todbringer} remains in Wolfenburg. Rumours suggest that whilst his input is having a moderating effect on tensions between Ostland and Talabecland, he is just delaying the onset of hostilities rather than preventing them.</p>\n<p>Graf @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Boris Todbringer} becomes increasingly active and engaged, gradually returning to his old self. He takes up hunting again, and there is talk that he has turned one eye toward the military adventuring he was famed for in his youth.</p>\n<p>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’ Katarina} seems to have been shocked out of her complacency due to the events of carnival week. The court is abuzz with gossip of how she is far more willing to exercise her influence than before. If the Characters encounter her they find her to be distinctly more confident and curious in her manner.</p>\n<p>Courtly life being what it is, not everyone is wholly pleased with these developments, but the general mood is one of revitalisation and optimism.</p>\n<p>The Characters are acknowledged for the part they have had to play, even if much of it remains a secret. While in Middenheim, the Characters’ Status becomes 3 higher than it would otherwise be (so Silver 4 becomes Gold 2, for example), and the Characters are made welcome at the court by those who know of their services to the Graf and Middenheim. </p>\n<p>While no impressive sums of gold or lavish titles are offered in reward, it should not take much for clever Characters to turn their new found status to their advantage. As long as this is done with discretion and respect, few at the court will complain.</p>\n<h3>Preparing For The Horned Rat</h3>\n<p>The next instalment of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong> is <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. The events of this adventure can occur directly after the resolution of <strong>Power Behind the Throne </strong>(and this will be easier for GMs to manage), but they can also occur after a period of respite for the Characters. </p>\n<p>The Horned Rat deals with the results of Wasmeier’s cooperation with Skaven. Certain of these creatures are developing an understanding of Dagmar von Wittgenstein’s insights into the movements of Morrslieb (see <strong>Death on the Reik</strong> for more information about Dagmar’s research) and intend to put this understanding to use.</p>\n<p>In order for the remaining parts of The Enemy Within campaign to progress smoothly you ought to keep the following things in mind.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>REQUIREMENTS</em></h3>\n<p><em>While some creativity will allow a canny GM to continue with <strong>The Enemy Within</strong> in most eventualities, certain outcomes are strongly recommended, and you should try to ensure the following remains true once the Carnival has drawn to a close.</em></p>\n<p><em>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier} still lives, and lies low in a hidden Drakwald lair for the time being.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Characters remain in the vicinity of Middenheim, and on good terms with at least some of the major NPCs.</em></p>\n<p><em>Whilst many low-ranking members of the Purple Hand are caught and killed, Senior Cult Magi Gottfried Jarmund and Erich Kalzbad keep their heads low and remain undiscovered.</em></p>\n<p><em>Purple Hand cells in other parts of the Old World, whilst suspected, are not uncovered.</em></p>\n<p><em>Whilst evidence of Skaven activity may be found, they remain a plausibly deniable menace to the city. The attack on the @JournalEntry[ieHrUyFz83TkBikg]{Templar’s Arms} by @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit’s} warband and the willingness to cooperate with humans in the kidnapping of Reya Ehrlich are aberrations that confuse even those who know of the Skaven.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Skaven lair of @JournalEntry[YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim} (see <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</strong>) remains undiscovered deep beneath the city.</em></p>\n<p><em>@Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris Todbringer} and his family remain alive.</em></p>\n<p><em>The political situation of the Empire at large remains tense. Minor border skirmishes and private wars between noble houses break out, and protests at the Emperor’s mutant edict or his takeover of Ubersreik grow heated. Nordlander separatists becomes common in the streets and taverns of Middenheim, and Ulrican disdain for Sigmarite values becomes increasingly vocal.  Ostland’s grievances with Talabecland remain unresolved, and a general sense of growing disquiet pervades the lives of folk all over the Empire.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>RECOMMENDED, </em><em>BUT NOT ESSENTIAL</em></h3>\n<p><em>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} is either still at large, or imprisoned awaiting trial.</em></p>\n<p><em>@Actor[Sy0829M1A3fxm57R]{Grand Vizier Bahr} of the Ordo Terribilis (see <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</strong>) remains at large, or at least alive.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Kastor Lieberung double lives and remains an active Character.

The desk is covered with many pots&nbsp; containing powder and face paint. A script also rests on the table, written in Breton with annotations in&nbsp; Reikspiel. In a corner of the room is a rolled up bedroll. There is also a large wardrobe in the room, containing sumptuous costumes.</p>\n<h4>Prop Room</h4>\n<p>Carboard scenery, prop weapons, table, chairs, rope</p>\n<h4>The Green Room</h4>\n<p>This large, and indeed green, room is where actors come to rest in between scenes. It is below the auditorium and the acoustics are such that speech and activity on the stage can be heard quite audibly here. There are a number of&nbsp;chairs, a table with some jugs of water and a plate of inexpensive pastries upon it. A battered but playable lute&nbsp;is propped up in one corner.</p>\n<h4>Old Store Room</h4>\n<p>This is a small room filled with clutter, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bookcase piled high with plays, including a number of very old folios.</li>\n<li>Boxes filled with paperwork regarding the running of the theatre, and old accounts.</li>\n<li>Playbills and posters.</li>\n<li>A large wardrobe filled with costumes.</li>\n<li>A broken viol da gamba (a sort of stringed instrument like a bass or cello) and a dented but serviceable trumpet.</li>\n<li>A coil of rope.</li>\n<li>Four barrels.

There is a seating area by some picture windows above the main entrance, and a small bar where nobles can order drinks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disused Office</h4>\n<p>This small room was once used as an office by the theatre management. In recent years they have moved to a less claustrophobic and stuffy office in an upper story of the building. The room contains a table and chairs, and shelves piled with more copies of plays and files of paperwork.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Check the @Condition[Unconscious] Condition.</p>\n<h4>Shooting into a Group</h4>\n<p>Ranged Tests made to hit a group of targets are <strong>Average (+20)</strong> if there is 3-6 of them, <strong>Easy (+40) </strong>if there are 7-12 of them, and <strong>Very Easy (+60)</strong> if there is 13 or more of them. Any successful hits are randomised between all likely targets as the GM prefers. If this modifier allows you to hit when the Test would otherwise have failed, you succeed with +0 SL.</p>\n<h4>Outnumbering</h4>\n<p>If you out-number an opponent 2 to 1, you gain a bonus of +20 to hit your opponent in melee combat. If you outnumber an enemy by 3 to 1, you get an even larger bonus of +40 to hit. Further, at the end of every Round, all outnumbered opponents lose 1 Advantage. Outnumbering is generally determined by how many Characters are Engaged with each other; if there is any doubt, the GM decides who is outnumbering whom.</p>\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<p>Size is an important factor when shooting at a target: it is far easier to hit a barn door than an apple. See @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q]{Size}. If this modifier allows you to hit when the Test would otherwise have failed, you succeed with +0 SL.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Combining Difficulties</em></h3>\n<p><em>There will be instances where multiple factors make taking a particular action more difficult than normal. Lurking in a gloomy forest as you attempt to shoot at a distant opponent through the trees is harder than shooting at the same opponent on a bright day in an open field. When combining multiple difficulties, use the following guidelines:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If the situation would apply two or more penalties, simply add the modifiers together to a maximum of –30 or Very Hard. For example, fog and aiming for a specific body part both make Weapon Skill Tests <strong>Hard (–20)</strong>. When combined, the Test would simply be <strong>Very Hard (–30),</strong> rather than suffer a –40 modifier. Similarly, if the situation would apply two or more bonuses, add the modifiers together to a maximum of +60 or Very Easy.</em><br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>If the situation would apply a penalty and a bonus, add them together to find the new difficulty. Attacking an opponent while standing in deep snow normally requires a <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong> Test. But attacking an opponent who is Prone requires an <strong>Easy (+20)</strong> Test. In a situation where both apply, the Test would be <strong>Difficult (–10) </strong>since –30 plus +20 equals –10.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Options: Shooting Into Melee</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">For most, simply choosing a target and rolling to hit is enough of a complication. However, some prefer the rules be more precise when firing at an Engaged target. If this is you, use the following rules:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Ballistic Skill Tests against Engaged opponents are resolved as normal, but suffer a penalty of –20 as you try your best to hit your specified target. If this modifier causes you to fail when the Test would otherwise have succeeded, you instead hit one of the target’s Engaged opponents, as determined randomly by the gM. If you do not care whom you hit, you may gain a bonus of +20 to +60 to hit, see Shooting into a Group.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"c8pB03MJECRvVVdb","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Combat"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Combat","sort":300001}}}

If the Characters enter at night, Melone is not present, and is instead off somewhere feeding, to return come sunrise.</p>\n<h3>&lsquo;WHO&rsquo;S WITH ME?&rsquo;</h3>\n<p>The Characters may be uncomfortable about confronting a Vampire by themselves and may ask other tenants to help them deal with the problem. However, each has an excuse &mdash; whether valid or not &mdash; as to why they can&rsquo;t:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfortunately, Gino is far too large to fit down the stairs and would be less than useless in the cramped basement.</li>\n<li>Annika Passerine refuses to leave her children alone, especially if the Characters are foolish enough to tell her there is a Vampire on the loose.</li>\n<li>Sreluc White-Eyes likewise refuses to leave his brother. Srulem, on the other hand, is determined to come with the Characters but can&rsquo;t even stand without at least two Characters helping him.</li>\n<li>Eluharath Wavecrest won&rsquo;t even bother to respond to their pleas for help &mdash; he&rsquo;s going to protect himself, and that&rsquo;s it.</li>\n<li>The other tenants all nervously mill around the top of the stairs if they are told what is happening and that the Characters are going into the basement. None of them are brave enough to go looking for a Vampire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Basement</h3>\n<p>The basement of the tenement building is a foul place where folks stopped going decades ago due to the quagmire below leaking through the floorboards. Now, heaps of old laundry, festering ancient mattresses, crate upon crate of spoiled goods, loose rusty nails, and all manner of awfulness creates an absolute maze for the unwary. To add to these perils, an insane Vampire stalks between the stacks, fascinated and terrified by all the changes inflicted upon her.</p>\n<p>To determine where the Vampire is in the maze, the Characters will be required to perform a <strong>Very Hard (&minus;30) Track</strong> Test. Failure means the Characters continue to stumble through the maze and must roll 1d100 on the Maze Encounters Table, adding +10 to the result per &minus; SL. On a success, move to The Vampire&rsquo;s Lair. After every failed Test, the Test must be repeated, but at a cumulative +10. If the group is working together, they perform only a single Test, gaining additional Tests only if they split up (and therefore, suffering more consequences).</p>\n<h3>PROBLEMS ALONG THE PATH</h3>\n<p>If there is ever a question over which Character suffers the effects of an encounter, either determine the target randomly or use the Character with the lowest score in the associated Skill or Characteristic. Example: Loose Nail would target the Character with the lowest Perception Skill.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if Melone is present, she can perform an<strong> Easy (+40) Perception</strong> Test each Round the Characters spend in the maze. If the Characters are specifically choosing to be stealthy, the Character with the lowest <strong>Stealth</strong> Skill in the group may make this an Opposed Test. If Melone succeeds on her <strong>Perception </strong>Test, she will wait until the party is in an ill-opportune position and will ambush them. However, it takes her as many Rounds as the &minus;SL of the last Track Test (as the Characters are far away from her, and she must reach them herself through the maze, or along the ceiling).</p>\n<h3>The Vampire's Lair</h3>\n<p>Maria Melone&rsquo;s lair is hidden against one wall in the twisting labyrinth that is the basement of the Spittlefeld Tenement Building. She has a small, broken, polished mirror (into which she can often be seen staring, wondering where her reflection has gone), and a large stash of candles (though no way to light them, nor need to use them in the dark). She sleeps on a pile of soiled and bloody bed sheets, stolen from some of her victims. In one corner are broken and grime-coated cooking utensils, set up in a mockery of a fine noble kitchen.</p>\n<p>If the Characters manage to sneak up on Maria whilst she is in her lair, she is either staring at the mirror or pretending to cook something whilst humming to herself.</p>\n<p>She acts scared when confronted, but immediately turns feral &mdash; like a rabid wolf &mdash; when threatened. If the Characters treat her kindly, she will quickly be overcome with hunger and will attack them.</p>\n<p>Maria will fight to the death once her blood is up and has no sense of self-preservation. She has been driven entirely insane by her experiences and cannot speak in anything but clipped and babbled phrases. She appears to think she&rsquo;s being disciplined by her employer, whom she keeps calling &lsquo;Lord Bruner&rsquo;.</p>"}

These rules bring another level of drama to your game and help bring the Old World’s inhabitants to life.</p>\n<h3>Psychology Test</h3>\n<p>If you are exposed to one of the following Psychological traits, you may resist its effects by passing a Cool Test at the beginning of the Round, with the Difficulty set by the GM. A successful Test lasts until the end of the current encounter, although additional Tests may be required if circumstances change.</p>\n<p>Example: Brokk has Animosity (Elves). When the Dwarf encounters some haughty Elves quaffing wine and laughing loudly in a tavern, he Tests his Cool to control himself; he passes, so is not subject to Animosity, though he does choose to spit on the ground as he passes the sneering things. Later, when one of the Elves jostles his arm, spilling his ale, his GM asks Brokk to Test again. This time he fails. So, setting down his tankard, he turns around to ‘have a word’ with the offending Elf, unable to stop himself from launching into a tirade about exactly what he thinks of their so-called nimbleness!</p>\n<h3>Psychology Traits</h3>\n<p>The following are the most common Psychology traits in WFRP.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Q2MCUrG2HppMcvN0]{Animosity (Target)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear (Rating)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.DrNUTPeodEgpWTnT]{Frenzy}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.5hH73j2NgPdsLCZN]{Hatred (Target)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.klCJX0mNpXYH5AIx]{Prejudice}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.meMkLEwdJIDLxM0B]{Terror (Rating)}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Custom Psychology</h3>\n<p>You can create your own psychological traits to reflect the events of your game. This is something that will vary depending on your group, and the style of game you choose to play. It is also an area that should be treated sensitively, and if in any doubt avoid anything that could upset a member of the group.</p>\n<p>In addition to the mechanical effects of these custom traits, they are a wonderful opportunity for roleplaying; taking on custom psychological traits allows you to show off or practice your roleplaying skills, and maybe earn some extra XP. See Advances in Chapter 2: Character for more about this.</p>\n<p>When making custom traits, you should consider both what provokes the trait to manifest, and what the effect will be. Will it make the character immune to some, or all other psychology traits? Will it offer a bonus in some situations? A penalty in others? As always, your GM is the ultimate arbiter in this situation. Sample bonuses or penalties a Psychological trait may offer include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>+1/–1 SL to specified Tests</li>\n<li>Immunity to specified psychological traits</li>\n<li>Prescribed or Proscribed Actions and Moves</li>\n<li>Gaining Conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.EBmSCscpk4vEDCD3]{Camaraderie (Group)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Mu5dU4IcP58LBQwi]{Phobia (Target)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.1y6Hv22y9C3UD8gX]{Trauma}</p>","folder":"KBFMpqeeMFWhdpSI","sort":800001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":800001}}}

Since the fighter is allowed no armour except a shield, only the bravest warriors take part. The @Actor[4iMDGr19M9tUx1SW]{Minotaur} is armed with a two-handed club. This year there are three Minotaurs in prime fighting condition, and in between bouts there will be lesser bouts pitting visiting warriors against captured Beastmen and other creatures. Two of the Minotaurs are already booked; one by the Dwarf @Actor[7qgDlG8BryDHpn4a]{Glugnur} and the other by Alchred von Hintz, a young, impoverished noble from Altdorf. This means that one Minotaur is free should one of the Characters wish to take part.</p>\n<p>While the Minotaurs do their best to kill their opponents, the fighters must @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.Ssod4QuBdyMS6F79]{Pull Their Blows}, which means that their strikes will not cause Critical Wounds.

The Minotaurs are rewarded with food when they win.</p>\n<p>The prize for winning a fight is a purse [[/r 5d10]] silver shillings, though particularly entertaining fights might attract additional coin from an exultant crowd. Ticket prices range from @Pay[2bp]{2 brass pennies} to @Pay[10ss]{10 silver shillings}, depending on the quality — or presence — of the seating. The winner of a Minotaur fight gains general public respect for the duration of the Carnival, and is noticed by the Midden Marshals and by any other major NPCs attending the event.</p>\n<p>If the challenger loses the fight by being reduced to zero Wounds, a number of trained ‘bullies’ leap into the ring.  They try to entice the Minotaur away before it starts eating its victim and enters a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.yRhhOlt18COq4e1q]{Frenzy}. Betting on Minotaur fights is fast and furious, and for outsiders the odds are generally based on species: Dwarfs 2:1; Humans 3:1, Elves 3:1, and Halflings 15:1.

Heavy leather gauntlets protect the hands against bites: holding and even carrying the cage is acceptable. In the past, live Snotlings were used, bound with leather straps into a rough ball shape. But today even the most hardened traditionalists acknowledge that this is barbaric and unnecessary. Also, being somewhat free within the cage allows them to bite anyone who handles the ball incautiously.</p>\n<p>Typical crowds are 2,000–3,000 for the quarter-finals, up to 4,000 for the semi-finals, and a capacity crowd of just over 5,000 for the final. The Bernabau Stadium is built to hold 4,800 spectators, but a typical Cup Final crowd is around 5,200. Unfortunately, the game does attract a hooligan element, and rioting is not unknown.

Since the fighter is allowed no armour except a shield, only the bravest warriors take part. The @Actor[4iMDGr19M9tUx1SW]{Minotaur} is armed with a two-handed club. This year there are three Minotaurs in prime fighting condition, and in between bouts there will be lesser bouts pitting visiting warriors against captured Beastmen and other creatures. Two of the Minotaurs are already booked; one by the Dwarf @Actor[7qgDlG8BryDHpn4a]{Glugnur} and the other by Alchred von Hintz, a young, impoverished noble from Altdorf.

Ticket prices range from @Pay[2bp]{2 brass pennies} to @Pay[10ss]{10 silver shillings}, depending on the quality — or presence — of the seating. The winner of a Minotaur fight gains general public respect for the duration of the Carnival, and is noticed by the Midden Marshals and by any other major NPCs attending the event.</p>\n<p>If the challenger loses the fight by being reduced to zero Wounds, a number of trained ‘bullies’ leap into the ring.  They try to entice the Minotaur away before it starts eating its victim and enters a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.yRhhOlt18COq4e1q]{Frenzy}.

{"_id":"5UVBumUG1gBLetDB","name":"The Cult of Shallya, Goddess of Mercy","content":"<p><strong>Seat of Power</strong>: Couronne, Bretonnia</p>\n<p><strong>Head of the Cult</strong>: Grande Matriarch</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Orders</strong>: Order of the Bleeding Heart, Order of the Chalice</p>\n<p><strong>Major Festivals</strong>: None</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Holy Books</strong>: <em>The Book of Suffering, Livre des Larmes, The Testament of Pergunda</em></p>\n<p><strong>Common Holy Symbols</strong>: White doves, keys, heart with a drop of blood</p>\n<p>Shallya is the Goddess of Healing, Mercy, and Compassion. She is the daughter of Verena and Morr, and the sister of Myrmidia. Shallya is normally portrayed as a young, beautiful maiden whose eyes are perpetually welling with tears as she weeps for the world’s pain. It is said Shallya’s compassion knows no bounds, and in some myths — such as the stories of Ranald tricking her into granting him immortality, or Manaan trapping her at the bottom of the sea — she seems trusting to the point of foolishness. However, her cultists maintain her mercy is available to all, without judgment. True foolishness consists of presuming to judge who is worthy of Shallya’s grace and who is not.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Most Old Worlders think of Shallya’s cult as composed of healers and physicians, but her worshippers also include many who work to help alleviate suffering of other kinds: charitable souls who help the poor; workers in orphanages, asylums, and refuges; and even brave folk who go in search of lost and missing people on behalf of their loved ones.  The cult is ruled by the far-reaching Order of the Bleeding Heart, which maintains all the temples, hospices, mercyhouses, and other holy sites. The significantly smaller Order of the Chalice tasks its mendicants to cleanse the Fly Lord’s influence, tackling the worst diseases and plagues wherever they may fester.</p>\n<p>Shallya’s cultists all wear white robes, often hooded, with a bleeding heart symbol embroidered on the left breast.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>The high temple of all Shallya’s cult is in Couronne, Bretonnia, built over a famous healing spring. Locals claim the magical waters were once poured there from the same chalice Shallya used to grant Ranald immortality, which they claim is the holy grail of the Lady, the patron Goddess of Bretonnia. Whatever the truth, it is a popular destination for pilgrims, many of whom travel there to be healed from intractable disease. Elsewhere, every town or city of any size has a temple to Shallya, and most smaller settlements have at least a shrine dedicated to her. Temples of Shallya normally consist of a courtyard with a temple on one side and an infirmary on the other, all constructed in southern styles. Larger temples have smaller subsidiary chapels, commonly endowed by local families, and are often connected to hospitals. Shrines are usually simple, often with the dove or heart of Shallya carved into stone, or with small fountains gushing eternal tears from simple statues.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances set by Shallya always involve helping the sick, poor, or downtrodden. A cultist might be sent to a village struck by a plague to tend the sick until the disease has passed. Shallya often tasks her servants to help the wounded at war, or patrol popular pilgrimage routes for those unable to complete their journeys due to ill health.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Strictures</span></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Always render assistance without judgement, based only on a person’s need.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never kill except in self-defence or when facing followers of the Fly Lord.</em></li>\n<li><em>Hunt down servants of the Fly Lord wherever they may fester.</em></li>\n<li><em>Shallya’s work is never done, so turn not to self-indulgence.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never take up arms; a walking stick and courage will suffice.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.C92dpJPRYpkZFsGu]{Blessing of Healing}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Jkt465WPdRcejLwl]{Blessing of Recuperation}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Blessing of Tenacity}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.uMECZBuDnb3qkc7k]{Anchorite's Endurance}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.8LcAFB6W37LDN70K]{Balm to a Wounded Mind}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.UtgGJK46K08TZpP5]{Bitter Catharsis}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.YCjWyU567vb4Rs11]{Martyr}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.YAauxOwJJa3JahxQ]{Shallya's Tears}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.SItGUVYokyOo7csk]{Unblemished Innocence}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/shallya.webp","folder":"NkiXlTQtgNkW3FMs","sort":800001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":800001}}}

However, he is optimistic about the future, letting it be known that he will grant his daughter's hand to the brave knight who slays the Jabberslythe and returns with its head. While the baron does leave the chateau to go hunting, he does not go beyond the barony's borders, claiming he is reluctant to \"Ieave my subjects to face the horrors of the Jabbeslythe alone\".</p>\n<p><strong>Baroness Fleur de la Rose (Steward)</strong> - An attractive blond woman somewherein her mid to late thirties, F!eur is a courteous and regalwife to the baron.

{"_id":"5gvMwgLgn3fAW3VM","name":"The Cost of Living","content":"<p>As they wander the Empire, adventurers likely fill their purses with coins of all three denominations, perhaps poor one day, unexpectedly rich the next. However, outside adventuring, most lives centre on a single coin type as determined by @JournalEntry[uOqWtxfjRN3BfC2z]{Social Status}. </p>\n<p>Those seeking to maintain their Status must also keep up appearances. After all, if you repeatedly appear as poorer than you are, others will unsurprisingly think you’re poor. In practice, dressing and eating as expected, and using trappings that are fitting for your station, is enough for most folks to simply accept you at face value. What this requires in practice is left up to the GM to determine, using the following as a guide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brass Tier</strong>: The poorest members of society are unlikely to see a gold coin in their lifetimes. They live humble lives, subsisting on plain foods and sleeping in shared rooms, and have little appearances to maintain. Indeed, peers are more likely to call them out for having airs and graces for spending too much on fine clothes and food than they are likely to note spending too little.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Silver Tier</strong>: The swelling middle-classes may use pennies for ale and gold for major purchases, but shillings are their standard currency. They dine well, sleep in comfortable beds, and wear good quality clothing.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Gold Tier</strong>: The wealthiest elites rarely bother themselves with pfennigs. They eat luxury foods, sleep on satin sheets, and always stand out from the crowd due to their expensive garb and trappings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For GMs preferring hard numbers, spending around half your Status every day is usually enough to maintain appearances, though you may be living a little frugally. So, if you have a Status of Silver 4, spending at least 2 shillings per day will do for food and board, where if you have Brass 2 Status, you need only spend a pfennig a day.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Money Slang</em></h3>\n<p><em>Various slang terms are used for coins across the Empire. Here are some of the more common terms.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Gold Crowns</strong>: Marks, Karls, Gelt</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Silver Shillings</strong>: Bob, Shimmies, Mucks</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Brass Pennies</strong>: Pfennigs, Clanks, Shrapnel</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":"BrtIycD1u7HxITud","sort":600000,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide","sort":700001}}}

Instead she sneaks off to the stables for a secret meeting with<strong> Fabio </strong>the stable hand.</p>\n<p><strong>10:05</strong></p>\n<p>After he finishes his drink, the elf sneaks upstairs without the innkeeper noticing him, he knocks on <strong>Felix&rsquo;s</strong> door and draws his dagger. When Felix opens the door, he is swiftly and savagely murdered by the elf in a brutal parody of the attack on the dryad. As he attacks the peasant, the elf tearfully repeats the dryad&rsquo;s name. &lsquo;Lorelei! Lorelei! Lorelei!&rsquo; Once Felix is killed, <strong>Kel Thanna</strong> arranges his body on the bed into a rough representation of a tree. The elf leaves the room through the window before he can be discovered. (See the murder scene section and floorplan for more details).</p>\n<p><strong>10:10</strong></p>\n<p>The elf creeps along the back of the inn and goes towards the stable. He enters the stable looking for a place to get rid of the bloody dagger. While looking for a suitable place he spots two figures rolling about in the haystack. He realizes that he has spotted the innkeeper&rsquo;s wife in a compromising position with a man who is not her husband. He stashes the bloody dagger under a drinking trough. As he goes to leave he realizes that the innkeeper&rsquo;s wife is watching him with a shocked look on her face. The elf smiles at her, puts a finger to his lips, makes a shushing gesture and then draws his finger across his neck. This leaves the innkeeper&rsquo;s wife in no doubt as to her fate if she informs on him. He then winks at her and strides out of the stable and enters the inn.</p>\n<p><strong>12:15</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marianne de Maromme</strong> and her servant Sophia Krupke arrive in a coach. Their coachmen give their bags to the innkeeper <strong>Tobias Wirtz</strong>. The innkeeper is annoyed because his wife has left him short staffed. He brings the two newly arrived females to the bar room and assigns one of the few remaining rooms to them. Marianne orders a glass of red wine while the servant girl drags Marianne&rsquo;s baggage to the room.</p>\n<p><strong>19:00</strong></p>\n<p>The player characters enter the courtyard of the inn. They see a coachman (<strong>Hans Yssels</strong>) outside the coachhouse.</p>\n<p>He is washing the wheels of his coach. He is in conversation with <strong>Fabio</strong> the stable hand, a good humoured, burly young man who leans on his pitchfork.</p>\n<p>A successful <strong>Perception test</strong> allows the character to overhear the stable hand boasting to the coachmen about his latest conquest. He says &lsquo;She is an experienced woman who knows a trick or two&rsquo;. None of the two men offer to help the characters. Fabio will look after their horses if asked and he can provide general information about the inn&rsquo;s services.</p>\n<p>Inside the inn they see an overworked and sweaty innkeeper serving tables, pouring drinks and shouting food orders into the kitchen. If the characters manage to get his attention and make an easy <strong>Fellowship test,</strong> he informs them that there is only one private room still available (room number two); otherwise they can use the dormitory or the stables.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Two simple peddlers are sitting at a table close to the door.

If the player characters make a successful Perception test they will see that he does not really believe this to be the case. The innkeeper suspects something is up but is far too busy at this time to confront her. Tobias asks one of the player characters to fetch some logs for the fire from the stable. He offers the person who fetches it a free drink for their trouble but can be bargained up to a free drink and a free meal if the character succeeds in a <strong>Haggle test.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>Gardet brothers </strong>are seated close to the front door. They drink their beer, pick at their food and anxiously watch the stairwell waiting for Felix to come downstairs for his evening meal.</p>\n<p>The <strong>elf </strong>sits alone at the back of the bar. He eats a light meal of vegetables and drinks a cup of bitter herb tea from his own supply.</p>\n<p><strong>Marianne de Maromme</strong> and her servant are seated close to the fireplace. Marianne is quite talkative and speaks to Sophia about the weather, dress material and the somewhat average quality of the inn&rsquo;s food.</p>\n<p><strong>19:15</strong></p>\n<p>After finishing their meal, <strong>Marianne</strong> and her servant play a game of cards together. She can be persuaded to let someone else join the game if a successful <strong>challenging Fellowship</strong> test is made. Marianne will make polite conversation with any character that joins her but she has a dislike of clerics. She also mentions that she is worried about the rough types that frequent roadside inns and does not want anyone taking advantage of her and her servant. Sophia only speaks when spoken to.</p>\n<p>The innkeeper places the firewood in the fire and lights it.</p>\n<p><strong>19:30</strong></p>\n<p>The four monks come downstairs and eat their meal in silence. They observe the other patrons.</p>\n<p><strong>20:00</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Raulf and Claude Gardet</strong> decide to go upstairs and ambush Felix the peasant in his room. Once upstairs they knock on his door but when there is no response they open it and enter the room. They are shocked to see the gruesome scene. The blood makes Claude feel ill and he tries to be sick out the window. He does not make it and he is sick on the right hand side of the beds. After a few moments they both compose themselves. They carefully search Felix&rsquo;s mutilated body for the treasure map, taking care not to disturb it. They find the map tucked into his undergarments. Claude Gardet trashes the room in an attempt to conceal their presence.</p>\n<p>Raulf convinces him that the best option is for them to go to their room and think about what to do next. They leave and cross the corridor to their own room. (See the murder scene section and floorplan for more details).</p>\n<p><strong>20:15</strong></p>\n<p>The monks finish their meals and return upstairs.

They continue to their room in silence.</p>\n<p><strong>20:25</strong></p>\n<p>After the evening rush is over, Tobias the innkeeper takes a well&shy;earned break and pours himself a pint of beer.</p>\n<p>He then approaches Marianne de Maromme and tries to sell the inn to her for 400 gp. She is not interested and asks him to stop bothering her. Dejected by her blunt refusal, he leaves the bar room and goes into the kitchen to help Otto the cook with the dishes.</p>\n<p><strong>20:30</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ernst Seiler the bounty hunter</strong> arrives and calls out to be served. The innkeeper comes out of the kitchen and the bounty hunter tries to book a private room. If the characters have taken the last room, the innkeeper informs Ernst that he will have to sleep in the dormitory or the stable because the characters have taken the last of the private rooms. The bounty hunter reluctantly pays the innkeeper for his stay in the dormitory and curses the characters under his breath. A<strong> difficult Perception test</strong> will allow the player characters to hear this. He glares at the player characters as he walks up the stairs to the dormitory. After depositing his backpack he returns to the bar room and orders a beer at the bar. After serving him the innkeeper returns to dishwashing duty in the kitchen.</p>\n<p><strong>20:35</strong></p>\n<p>The Bounty hunter watches everyone in the bar and tries to use his Classical trap on all the male patrons (see handout). If any character falls for the trap or acts suspiciously, Ernst plans to attack them in the middle of the night. If any character uses magic in his presence he will also assume they are the evil wizard.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The bearer of this message is a bit soft in the head.

While walking to his room he overhears <strong>Raulf and Claude Gardet</strong>&nbsp;talking excitedly in their room. He creeps up to the door and listens. He hears them talk about the treasure map and the multicoloured tree. The elf walks away and goes to his room determined that these two men will not see the dawn.</p>\n<p><strong>20:55</strong></p>\n<p>The Gardet brothers return downstairs and order two beers. They make casual conversation with the other patrons of the inn.</p>\n<p><strong>21:00</strong></p>\n<p>Anyone who is in the bar area can overhear the innkeeper &amp; his wife having a heated argument in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>He can be heard accusing her of faking her illness and leaving him to do all the work. She retaliates by chucking kitchen implements at him and calls him an insensitive pig. If any of the characters enter the kitchen they should make a <strong>routine Agility</strong> test or be hit by whatever kitchen implement Jessica has handy. Tobias does not want to get hit by his upset wife and runs out of the kitchen, through the bar room and into the safety of the courtyard.</p>\n<p>She emerges from the kitchen with a rolling pin. She shouts after him &lsquo;A woman has needs Tobias!&rsquo;</p>\n<p>After the argument, she goes upstairs to her quarters to lie down for a bit. On her way along the corridor, she notices that there is some soiled linen in the doorway of the peasant &rsquo;s room. After picking it up, she peeks through the doorway of the room, accidentally discovering the grisly murder scene. The innkeeper&rsquo;s wife begins to scream her head off.</p>\n<p><strong>21:10</strong></p>\n<p>The innkeeper rushes in from the courtyard closely followed by the stable hand. They both run upstairs towards the sounds of Jessica&rsquo;s screams.</p>\n<p><strong>21:15</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gillebert le Cler</strong>, a tired and irritated squire arrives at the inn. His lord, <strong>Thierry de Betencourt</strong>, lays slumped unconscious over his horse. A <strong>prisoner</strong> walks behind the other horse, he is tied to the horse with some rope and his hands are manacled. Gillebert le Cler&nbsp;is annoyed at the lack of a welcome. He bangs on the outer gate if it is locked. If the characters are in the courtyard area, a <strong>routine Perception test </strong>will alert them to his banging, otherwise a <strong>challenging Perception test</strong> will be enough to hear it. When he gains entry to the inn compound, he drops the prisoner into the cell in the courtyard, locks him up and carries his injured colleague into the bar room.</p>\n<p>The squire clears a table and carefully lays his unconscious partner on top of it. The squire asks anyone in the bar if they can help heal his lord. <strong>Otto the cook </strong>helps as best he can and tries to make the injured knight comfortable.</p>\n<p><strong>21:20</strong></p>\n<p>The innkeeper and his wife return to the bar room. She is very distraught after witnessing the murder scene.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards the stable hand also comes down. If a character makes a<strong> routine Perception test</strong> they will notice that he looks angry when he sees his Uncle Tobias comforting Jessica and storms out of the bar. The cook pours the innkeeper&rsquo;s wife a large brandy to calm her nerves. The squire is annoyed at the poor service and demands to know what is going on. The innkeeper does his best to explain.</p>\n<p><strong>21:30</strong></p>\n<p>The squire asks the Gardet brothers to help guard the prisoner for a few hours while he gets some much&shy;needed sleep. He has spoken to them before in the inn and while patrolling the roads. He offers them four shillings for their trouble. The hunters accept and leave to guard the prisoner in the cell.</p>\n<p>The tired squire quickly investigates the murder scene but his cursory search does not discover any clues.</p>\n<p>The four monks stand silently in the corridor observing the activities in and around the peasant&rsquo;s room. The elf comes out of his room and walks down the corridor, quietly satisfied at the chaos he has caused for the humans.</p>\n<p>He then goes outside to relieve himself in the latrine. He notices the two brothers standing outside the cell and as he walks back to the bar room he begins to form a plan to kill them.</p>\n<p><strong>21:50</strong></p>\n<p>The innkeeper informs the characters that he must confiscate their room for the knights. He apologizes for the inconvenience but says that the knight is injured. Tobias says that the characters have a couple of options available to them. There is room in the dormitory, or they could sleep in the stable if they don&rsquo;t mind roughing it or they could stay in the recently deceased peasant&rsquo;s room. Of course they would have to clean it themselves because he is so short staffed at the moment. If they agree to clean it, he will not charge them for staying in Felix&rsquo;s old room. If any of the characters choose to sleep in the stables and use a light source, they may see a glint of metal under a horse trough. They will spot it if they make a <strong>challenging Perception test</strong> or a successful Sixth Sense test. Further investigation reveals it to be an ornate and bloodstained dagger. This is the murder weapon.</p>\n<p>The squire is only interested in getting a few hours sleep and he will evict the characters from their room if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>22:00</strong></p>\n<p>In the bar room, <strong>Kel Thanna</strong> announces to anyone who will listen that he has had enough excitement for one day and he is going to bed.</p>\n<p><strong>22:30</strong></p>\n<p>The Innkeeper tries to sell the inn to characters. He drops his price to 350 gp but with a bit of negotiation and a Haggle test he could be haggled down to 300 gp.</p>\n<p>The elf sneaks out of his bedroom window and watches the hunters from the rooftop. He begins to weep for his lost love. He gradually slips into a semi&shy; meditative trance, allowing the forest and the darkness to inspire him into a deeper psychopathic state. If any of the characters see him on the roof he will tell them he finds the inn to be too claustrophobic and needs to be at one with nature.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile in the stable, a tired stable hand falls asleep in the hay. A hard days work has obviously worn him out.</p>\n<p><strong>23:00</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jessica</strong> the innkeeper&rsquo;s wife is now quite drunk. The brandy has given her the courage to confront the innkeeper in the main bar area. She accuses him of being a worthless husband who cares more about his stupid inn than her. She prods him in the chest with her finger and taunts him about his inadequacies. The embarrassed and increasingly angry innkeeper slaps her across the face. Jessica responds by shoving him with both hands.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the Innkeeper stumbles backwards, loses his balance and crashes into the log fire. Within seconds his hair and clothes are on fire. The innkeeper&rsquo;s wife begins to scream for help, distraught at what she has just done. Pandemonium breaks out in the bar area as the patrons rush to avoid the blazing innkeeper. He is oblivious to their presence. All he can do is thrash about in a futile attempt to put himself out. Have the player characters make a couple of routine Agility tests to avoid getting hit by Tobias. If any of the player characters try to heal Tobias in time, a successful Heal check will enable them to patch up most of his second&shy;degree burns. It&rsquo;s amazing what you can do with the fat of a goose and some rabbit urine! He will have some superficial blistering of the skin, and he will suffer pain for the next few days. Of course, if the player characters don&rsquo;t put the flames out in time Tobias is toast!</p>\n<p><strong>23.05</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hans Fleischer</strong> wakes up in the cell. He is disorientated at first but soon finds his bearings. He overhears the brothers talking to each other and decides to feign sleep. His guile soon pays off as the loose&shy;tongued brothers talk of the treasure map, their treacherous plans for Felix and their discovery of the crime scene.</p>\n<p><strong>23.15</strong></p>\n<p>Realising that this may be his only chance to escape from the gallows, <strong>Hans Fleischer</strong> calls out to the two brothers. If the characters are in the courtyard area, a <strong>challenging Perception test</strong> will alert them to his shouts, otherwise a hard Perception test will be enough to hear his shouts. Once he gets the brother&rsquo;s attention, he casually asks if the squire knows of their theft of the map and apparent involvement in the murder. The two brothers quickly discuss the merits of this proposal and agree to help him escape, but only if he keeps quiet about their secrets. He promises to keep quiet and the brothers agree to ambush the squire when he returns to check on the prisoner.</p>\n<p><strong>23:30</strong></p>\n<p>After a couple of hours rest, a slightly less fatigued squire leaves the inn to relieve the two brothers of their guard duty. While thanking them and paying them for a job well done, both brothers ambush him. They knock him over the head with their clubs but the squire is able to shout for help before he is knocked unconscious.</p>\n<p>If the characters are in the courtyard area, a<strong> routine Perception test </strong>will alert them to his shouts, otherwise a <strong>Perception test </strong>will be enough to hear the shouts. The brothers search through his pockets for the key to the cell.</p>\n<p>They find it, open the cell, hoist the prisoner out and drop the squire down into the pit. The prisoner quickly thanks the hunters and tells them their secret is safe with him. He then runs across the courtyard to the stables in search of a decent horse.</p>\n<p><strong>23:32</strong></p>\n<p>From deep within his trance, the elf becomes aware of a commotion in the courtyard. He sees the brothers standing close to the open cell and watches as the prisoner escapes. <strong>Kel Thanna</strong> decides that the time is right to attack the brothers. He drops down from the roof and sprints across the courtyard towards them. He hurtles towards the brothers; his tear&shy;stained face contorts as he begins to attack.</p>\n<p><strong>23:35</strong></p>\n<p>While reading in her room, <strong>Marianne de Maromme</strong> hears the fighting in the courtyard and realizes that this may be a good time to slip off into the forest without being noticed. She quickly packs her belongings and tells her servant Sophia to come downstairs to see what is going on in the courtyard. Reluctantly the servant agrees.</p>\n<p>While trying to steal a horse in the stable the prisoner is challenged by the stable hand. A fight breaks out and the prisoner manages to overpower the sleepy stable hand. A successful <strong>Perception test </strong>alerts the characters to the fighting. The escaping prisoner is willing to take his chances in the dark forest rather than face the prospect of hanging for his crime. He jumps on a horse and bolts out of the stable. (Any characters in the area may attempt an <strong>Agility test</strong> or a <strong>Dodge test</strong> to avoid the charging horse. They could also make a challenging Ride test to try and dismount him.</p>\n<p><strong>23:45</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marianne de Maromme</strong> leads her servant girl by the arm across the courtyard. When Marianne reaches the outer gate, a suspicious Sophia asks her mistress what is going on. Her mistress tells her to be quiet and opens up the gate.</p>\n<p>Sophia realizes she is in danger and attempts to break free. Marianne de Maromme will do anything to deliver Sophia to the beastmen and is willing to use her full range of powers to achieve her goal. If she manages to get Sophia outside the outer walls she will scream for the beastmen who are waiting close by in the dark forest.</p>\n<p><strong>01:00 &ndash; 07:00</strong></p>\n<p>Sometime during the night the bounty hunter attacks the person who acted suspiciously when viewing the classical trap. If he witnesses Marianne de Maromme casting any spells he will attempt to bring her to justice. If no one arouses his suspicions he may realize he&rsquo;s lost out on this bounty and reluctantly return to his boss. On the other hand, he may hang around the inn for a week hassling innocent travellers with his piece of parchment. Hans is not a bright lad.</p>"}

This morning they found that one of their specimen&rsquo;s was taken from them - a small Hobgoblin judged too puny to serve in the mercenary companies that ply their trade in Tilea.</p>\n<p>However, after they docked last night a couple of things happened. Firstly, their halfling translator, Bernhardt Elderberry, went missing. The Tileans are used to him being somewhat unreliable and so have just assumed he is off somewhere filling his face with victuals or looking for some of the Mootland smoking weed he is so fond of.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the crate containing the hobgoblin, and the creature itself, was taken from the deck of their barge.</p>\n<p>The Tileans are not yet worried about their halfling companion. But if they are told about the pattern killings, or asked about why none of them speak Reikspiel despite doing business here, or why no one was on watch, they will tell the PCs all about Bernhardt Elderberry, who was travelling with them and acting as their interpreter and who they haven&rsquo;t seen since yesterday evening.</p>\n<h2>THE TILEANS AND TARWIN</h2>\n<p>The Tileans do suspect a particular person of taking the Hobgoblin, as a man was paying their vessel a great deal of attention last night. If Tarwin is brought in before they have been spoken too they will become very agitated. If not then they will give a description of the man and explain that he was loitering about when they docked yesterday. Tarwin will be very dismissive of the Tileans, and make numerous disparaging remarks about foreigners.</p>\n<h2>INVESTIGATING THE BARGE</h2>\n<p>Should the Watchmen investigate the barge they will find it carries a number of crates and cages containing various animals. One of the cabins is furnished with very small furniture and pipes and other smoking paraphernalia have been left lying out on a little desk. This is Bernhardt&rsquo;s cabin.

{"_id":"607SnbwB5tI3BQYV","name":"Politics","content":"<p>The Reikland perceives itself as a progressive, civilised realm, standing apart from the backward barbarity of the other provinces. It is ruled by an Elector Count bearing the title ‘Grand Prince of the Reikland’ — the ‘grand’ appellation indicating the prince is an elector for the next emperor when the current one dies. The grand prince’s land is divided into a patchwork of individual fiefs governed by dukes, counts, margraves, high priests, abbots and other rulers. These provinces, whose lords swear directly to the grand prince, are collectively titled the ‘Reikland Estates’, most of which have been ruled by the same families or institutions for uncounted generations, affording them significant influence. The grand prince’s decrees are ratified by the ‘Reikland Diet’, an assembly comprised of the lords of the Reikland Estates. However, certain powers were reserved for the crown during Magnus the Pious’s Imperial Reforms two centuries ago, including: the right to summon and command the State Army of the Reikland, the raising of emergency taxes in times of crisis, the right to authorise new coinage, and the right to call a High Lord Steward’s Court should a powerful noble be charged with a crime.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[1BTOtQ5fabJYODnr]{Reikland Council}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[pEOKgWew8MGemEW2]{The Reikland Diet}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[sfNEA2DvorlEiEPk]{The Reikland Estates}</p>","folder":"vrsSSGXYVnoGWa0s","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Politics"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Politics","sort":100001}}}

Since the Graf has been uninterested in the hunt for some months, Allavandrel is bored. He has no influence with the Graf in political matters, although he could if he wished — politics simply do not interest him. However, he does see the Graf moderately often.</p>\n<p>Locations</p>\n<p>Allavandrel has a town house in the @JournalEntry[UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor} district. He attends many Carnival events, and is easy to encounter at the @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tourney} or at various hostelries, ranging from swanky to dangerous.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Elves</strong>: +10 to all Fellowship Tests. While he and @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} are fast friends, he longs for more Elven company.</p>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: –10 to all Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Halflings</strong>: +5 to all Fellowship Tests. Allavandrel employs a talented and friendly Halfling housekeeper, called Cordelia Greenhill, and he has developed a soft spot for the little folk thanks to her example.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Allavandrel knows who influences @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris}, but not much more. However, the sociable Elf is well-connected and can provide introductions to @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane}, the Ladies at Court, and possibly even the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}. He may know where someone (such as the Chancellor) might obtain more exotic substances (see ‘@JournalEntry[mNMoXXZJKYGjXH7O]{The Harmacist},’), although he will be worried if the Characters specifically name the Chancellor in this regard. A solid fighter and outstanding archer, he might also be of direct, adventuring, help to the Characters, but only if this is absolutely necessary.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Allavandrel has a fair idea of who influences the Graf, although he is inclined to overestimate the influence of the @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Marshals} and @JournalEntry[O1WGhtHQNazslML1]{Ar-Ulric}.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Allavandrel likes the idea of a Dwarf Tax, but knows it will lead to trouble: he is unhappy that Rallane is being blamed, and would like to see his friend exonerated on this score. He has no opinion about the other taxes. Knowing that the Graf is ailing, and the city is vulnerable, he wonders whether he should become more active politically.</p>\n<p>The Elf has a taste for adventure. He knows that Baron @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich} thinks well of him, and he is not blind to the fact that Heinrich would make a fine Graf. He is wise enough to know that such thoughts may not be spoken, but he would encourage any Character who seemed to share in this notion. Given the Graf ’s condition, surely the time for action cannont be more than a year or two away. However, he won’t take any overt risks.</p>\n<p>During Carnival week, Allavandrel’s main goal is retain his archery title, and to have as much fun as possible: high life at night, possibly helping the Characters by day with information and introductions to other NPCs. However, he will talk the matter over with @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} first, and only after the Characters have made some appreciable headway on their own.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Allavandrel has always felt a little sorry for him, feeling that this honest but painfully shy man is not a bad fellow if given a chance. He has taken the trouble to rescue Sparsam from social embarrassment once or twice, but their relations are still formal. Allavandrel has not been in a position to notice any odd behaviour or signs of addiction.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: A good friend and drinking companion, Allavandrel enjoys Dieter's company above most other humans. Dieter and Allavandrel have not discussed the tax changes, but he was surprised to learn of Dieter’s expressed views from Rallane.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Very close friends, they wine, dine, and sing together, and encourange each other in the pursit of occassional but always memorable romances. Allavandrel is rather more steady and realistic than Rallane, and often ends up having to escort the minstrel home after a heavy night.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘The Princess’</strong>: Thinks her naïve, but kindly and charitable.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: He is indifferent to her, but treats her courteously.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: He knows von Genscher very slightly, but has no strong feelings about them.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: No dealings. He would be pleased to learn that Janna Eberhauer finds him attractive.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: No dealings. Allavandrel is not overly interested in human religious practices, though is inclined to sympathy with the cults of Taal and Rhya.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: Friends, on and off, for some years; they have enjoyed the occasional dalliance, but never more. Allavandrel is glad of this,  since he now strongly suspects that Emmanuelle is the Graf ’s Paramour. He knows nothing of her affair with Ar-Ulric, but suspects from her demeanour that there may be someone else.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Friendly with Kirsten and Petra, and has sometimes enjoyed a long evening with Petra. He has also escorted them about town many times.  He doesn’t like Natasha, thinking her cold and joyless.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Allavandrel finds him ridiculous, and will insult him to anyone who listens.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Does not know him personally, but knows from Dieter that the man is a crook, and knows from others that he treats women badly: both things Allavandrel dislikes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: They have met only once, and that was briefly. As it happened, Luigi was very quiet at the time, and they had a brief conversation about court affairs. Based on this one meeting, Allavandrel feels that the Tilean cannot be as bad as his reputation suggests.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: No dealings. He knows them only by reputation, but imagines they must be rather stuffy.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer: </strong>The Elf knows Rothbert as a casual acquaintance who can be good company and always knows a good hostelry when they need one.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Allavandrel only rarely crosses paths with Breugel, and has no particular opinion of him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[KZjUllCfHJl4kZ2F]{Thognar}- The Clerk</strong>: Allavandrel does not know Thognar well, but has had dealings with the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission of Elf, Dwarf, and Halfling Interests} in the past and is aware of his petition. If the Characters express concerns about the taxes to Allavandrel, he suggests they see the Dwarf. However, he would cool towards Thognar if he knew of Thognar’s conspiratorial talk about Rallane.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Allavandrel has no dealings with Mueller.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>No dealings.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts},  @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag: </strong>@JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag:</strong> @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag:</strong> @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Horse Fair}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag: </strong>@JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Elven Lightsingers}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 4}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag:</strong> @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Semi-Final 1}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag:</strong> @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Water Polo Tournament}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Snotball Final}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag: </strong>@JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>\n<h3>Allavandrel at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>Allavandrel is a highly sociable individual, and is relatively easy to approach, especially for fellow Elves and good-looking characters. His lack of interest in politics makes it difficult for the Characters to impress upon him the seriousness of the plot against the Graf, and even more difficult to convince him that he can be of any help to them.</p>\n<p>While he is not as likely as @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} the minstrel to be the target of Dwarf outrage at the new taxes, the Characters may still have the opportunity to rescue Allavendrel from some angry, drunken Dwarfs who are bent on delivering ‘a good kicking’ to any Elf they find. This risk is greater away from the public events of the Carnival, and among the lower-class hostelries where Allavandrel sometimes likes to drink. A good performance at the archery tournament is a somewhat safer way of making a good impression on him.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Allavandrel can introduce the Characters to a great many other NPCs, including @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane}, @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten}, @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra}, and @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle}. If the Characters have a pressing reason to meet @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} or the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess,’} Allavandrel can help, although he is not as close to them as to the others.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/allavandrel-fanmaris.webp","folder":"YbdT1wAfqZmWtR79","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}

If you want to seek out some piece of obscure arcana, you must first seek out an expert. You may undertake the Consult an Expert Endeavour either to facilitate another Endeavour for example: @JournalEntry[AOA5HIAVu5ye2c6a]{Commission}, @JournalEntry[Qs6PphnDbZMSow9A]{Training}, or @JournalEntry[BA9gvu3aNpD75VLB]{Unusual Learning} Endeavours), or to secure a piece of specific knowledge. </p>\n<p>There are two stages to this Endeavour: locating the expert, then consulting. </p>\n<p>First, you must locate your expert (this stage may be skipped with the GM’s permission if you have already identified an appropriate expert during your adventures).  Attempt a <strong>Challenging (+0) Gossip</strong> Test (the Difficulty of this Test will vary according to the size of the settlement where your character is currently living). If you succeed, you have located your expert. If you fail, you have located the loudest self-proclaimed specialist in your location, and the GM is given free rein to vary the quality or accuracy of the advice procured. You can of course refuse to deal with this somewhat suspect source, but you never know if you might have found a diamond in the rough. GMs are contrary like that sometimes.  </p>\n<p>Once successfully locate an expert, you then need to convince them to talk with you. Depending on what you wish to know, this may require no more than a Simple Charm Test or a modest donation to the local Temple of Verena. In more extreme cases, you may have to commit to performing one or more @JournalEntry[dqiHv9D7H6mZYc6i]{Favours} which may be called in during a future adventure, or ‘bought off ’ by spending Endeavours between future adventures. The level of Favour owed depends on the complexity — and danger — of the information you want as determined by the GM. </p>\n<p>The precise nature of the information gleaned depends on the expert consulted and what you seek to know. Academics will know the origins and full history on a subject with which they are familiar; wizards of the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf understand the history of magic and various mystical objects, particularly aspects relevant to their own order; an Apothecary General can identify even the rarest poison; a Verenan scholar may have information relating to any number of historical incidents. In short, the expert’s background will influence how the knowledge is presented, and with which biases.</p>\n<p>In addition to any specific information the GM imparts to their player, a successful Consult an Expert Endeavour used to seek out knowledge (and not to facilitate another Endeavour) gives you an Expert Reroll (mark this on your character sheet under Notes). This reroll may only be used on a Test specifically relating to the lore revealed and must be used before the end of your next adventure. </p>","folder":"3inZgCNdZwR3yWXW","sort":500001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"General Endeavours"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"General Endeavours","sort":500001}}}

Until the tack is repaired, all future Ride Tests suffer a &ndash;20 penalty.</p>\n<h3>Cast Shoe</h3>\n<p>The animal loses a shoe. The rider must make a <strong>Difficult (&ndash;10) Ride</strong> Test or fall off (a distance of 2 yards). The animal must move at a Walk until the shoe has been replaced by a farrier.</p>\n<p>Forcing the animal to move faster cause it to become Lame.</p>\n<h3>Lame</h3>\n<p>The animal cannot move faster than half its Walk speed, cannot be ridden or carry packs, and cannot pull a load. Attempting to bring the animal any further on a journey using the Travel rules (page 31) increases the journey length by 1 Stage. Any attempt to do any of these things costs the animal 1d10 Wounds, regardless of Toughness Bonus.

Usually, when a horse or similar breaks a leg, there is little hope of it surviving.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>BEING DRAGGED</h3>\n<p>Falling from the saddle is bad enough &mdash; the equivalent of 2 yards on to the ground &mdash; but in the Old World things can always go from bad to worse very quickly. Every rider dreads being thrown from the saddle with one foot still caught in the stirrup, and then dragged helplessly along a rocky road by a panicking mount.</p>\n<p>When a Character falls from a mount because of an Astounding Failure, they must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Dodge </strong>Test. Failure indicates that the unfortunate individual has been caught with one foot still in a stirrup. If the mount is standing still, the fallen rider can try to free the tangled foot from the stirrup by making an <strong>Extended Challenging (+0) Athletics </strong>Test requiring 3 Success Levels. With the final success, the rider has managed to bend, stretch, and twist into a position where both hands can reach the foot and stirrup.</p>\n<p>If the mount is moving, a rider is nearly helpless. The rider is<span style=\"font-style: normal;\"> @Condition[Prone] </span>and <em>@Condition[Entangled], </em>and suffers one Damage each turn if the mount is walking, or the mount&rsquo;s Movement characteristic in damage each round if it is troting or cantering. There is no Strength Test to break the entanglement, but if the rider has a sharp weapon on hand (and did not drop or lose it in the fall) a successful <strong>Very Hard (&ndash;30) Weapon Skill</strong> Test cuts through the stirrup strap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vehicle Speeds</h2>\n<p>An animal pulling a cart, wagon, coach, or other vehicle moves more slowly than one that is running free or carrying a rider. Animals pulling a vehicle may only Walk or Trot safely.</p>\n<p>Operators carrying, pushing, or pulling a vehicle may only Walk.</p>\n<p>An animal may be forced to move at a Run whilst pulling a vehicle. The driver must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Drive </strong>Test every mile, with a penalty of &ndash;10 per mile already travelled while at a Run. A failure slows the animals to a Walk, and each animal must make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test or gain a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition.</p>\n<p>An Astounding Failure (&ndash;6 SL) by the driver on the <strong>Drive Test</strong> requires a roll on the Vehicle Mishap Table. An Impressive or worse failure on any an animal&rsquo;s Endurance Test imposes an additional Fatigued Condition, and an Astounding Failure costs the beast 1d10 Wounds in addition (modified by Toughness Bonus, to a minimum of 1).</p>\n<h3>VEHICLE MISHAPS</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 40.6286%; height: 80px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 22.9345%; height: 16px;\"><strong>1d100</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 76.2843%; height: 16px;\"><strong>Riding Mishap Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 22.9345%; height: 16px;\">01&mdash;50</td>\n<td style=\"width: 76.2843%; height: 16px;\">Out of Control!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 22.9345%; height: 16px;\">51&mdash;79</td>\n<td style=\"width: 76.2843%; height: 16px;\">Damaged</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 22.9345%; height: 16px;\">80&mdash;95</td>\n<td style=\"width: 76.2843%; height: 16px;\">Broken</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 22.9345%; height: 16px;\">96&mdash;100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 76.2843%; height: 16px;\">Crash!</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Many of these mishaps result in a vehicle Crashing if it is moving faster than Walking speed.

The vehicle may continue at a walking speed only until repaired by someone with an appropriate Trade Skill, such as <strong>Trade (Carpenter)</strong> or <strong>Trade (Cartwright)</strong>. If driven faster, the vehicle becomes Broken after 1d10 rounds.</p>\n<h3>Broken</h3>\n<p>Something vital breaks: a harness, wheel, or axle. If the vehicle is pulled by a team of animals, they may have become untied from the vehicle: the driver must make a successful<strong> Challenging (+0) Athletics</strong> Test in order to let go of the reins and avoid being pulled out of the driver&rsquo;s seat. A failure indicates a Fall and <strong>Being Dragged</strong>, per the riding mishap (page 26).</p>\n<p>The vehicle suffers 1d10 Damage immediately, modified by Toughness Bonus minimum 1. The vehicle may not be driven further until repaired with an appropriate <strong>Trade</strong> Skill, such as <strong>Trade (Carpenter)</strong> or <strong>Trade (Cartwright)</strong>. Anyone in the vehicle suffers 1 Wound immediately, unmodified by Toughness Bonus or Armour Points.</p>\n<p>If the vehicle was moving faster than walking speed, treat this result as a Crash instead.</p>\n<h3>Crash</h3>\n<p>The vehicle collides with something at speed. Occupants of Crashing vehicles suffer 2d10 Wounds modified by Toughness Bonus and Armour Points minimum 1. The vehicle suffers 2d10 Damage immediately, modified by Toughness Bonus, minimum 1. Crashed vehicles must be repaired by someone with an appropriate <strong>Trade</strong> Skill, such as <strong>Trade (Carpenter)</strong> or<strong> Trade (Cartwright)</strong> before they can be driven again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>MOVE OVER!</h3>\n<p>Sometimes the grass is greener on the other side, and you need to move from one vehicle or mount to another without taking the time to stop. Leaping on to a moving vehicle requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics </strong>Test. If the Character fails they miss their target, suffering a 2-yard fall. Leaping on to a moving mount without a rider requires the same Test, followed by a <strong>Challenging (+0) Ride</strong> Test if the mount has the <strong>Skittish </strong>Trait.</p>\n<p>If you attempt to leap on to a mount that has a rider, you must also make an <strong>Opposed Ride</strong> Test against the current rider &mdash; the winner remains on the mount and the loser is thrown off, suffering a 2-yard fall.</p>\n<p>These rules assume that you are jumping from a mount or vehicle that has matched speeds with your target.

When they first encounter Skaven (@JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{‘Chaos Strikes by Night’}), they will probably want to pursue them as well, having been frustrated in their previous encounter in Castle Wittgenstein.

He can Test the Gamble Skill at 36% as it is Basic, and anyone can Test Basic Skills. The Heal Skill is an Advanced Skill, so Adhemar has no idea how to patch up wounds beyond screaming loudly for a doctor!</em></p>\n<h3>Grouped Skills and Specialisation</h3>\n<p>Some Skills are classified as Grouped . This means the Skill is an array of related Skills under one heading. Each related Skill is called a Specialisation . When a Specialisation is mentioned in the rules, it is marked in brackets.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Language is a Grouped Skill, thus represents many related Language Skills under a single Skill heading. Examples of the different Specialisations of Language are: Language (Bretonnian), Language (Magick), or Language (Mootish).</em></p>\n<p>When you gain an Advance in a Grouped Skill, you must allocate the Advance to an appropriate Specialisation. Sometimes the Specialisation options will be marked clearly in your Career, so you simply select one of the options on offer. In other cases — such as when a Specialisation is marked as ‘Any’, meaning you can choose one Specialisation — you will need to select a Specialisation yourself; should this be required, either refer to the relevant Skill description and choose from the sample Specialisations found there, or, with GM permission, create a unique Specialisation that fits the Skill and best suits your character. </p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Theodora has a choice of Lore (Any) in her career. When she allocates an Advance to that option, she has to decide which Lore Specialisation to take. After some deliberation, she chooses to advance her Lore (Theology), showing she has learned something of the Gods.</em></p>\n<p>Other than that, Grouped Skills are handled in exactly the same way as normal Skills, with each Specialisation handled like a unique Skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Sigrid has 8 Advances in the Basic Skill, Entertain (Singing), but nothing in Entertain (Acting). This means she Tests her Fellowship of 41 when attempting to act, and Tests 49 when singing (41+8=49). By comparison, Theodora has a single Advance in the Advanced Skill Animal Training (Pigeons), but no Advances in Animal Training (Horses). This means she can use the Skill to train her pigeons to drop bombs on unsuspecting enemies, but she cannot train her horse to do the same, as she has no idea how to train horses.</em></p>","folder":"KBFMpqeeMFWhdpSI","sort":900001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":900001}}}

{"_id":"7XmvBR1YJPEUOgEu","name":"Healing","content":"<h3><strong>Healing</strong></h3>\n<p>In time, most injuries heal. But some are worse than others. The following explains how to heal Wounds and Critical Wounds.</p>\n<h4><strong>Healing Wounds</strong></h4>\n<p>You are considered wounded if you have lost any of your Wounds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Without medical attention, you can attempt an <strong>Average (+20) Endurance</strong> Test after a good sleep once a day. You Heal Wounds equal to the SL + your Toughness Bonus. For each day you spend taking it easy, you also heal an extra number of Wounds equal to your Toughness Bonus.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong>: This can be done automatically in the main tab of the character sheet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you wish to Heal more Wounds than this, then you need to be attended by someone with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.HXZaV1CJhmTvcAz4]{Heal} skill or you’ll need bandages, a healing poultice, or similar.</p>\n<p>There is no penalty for being wounded. Lost Wounds are considered to be small cuts, bruises, and other easily ignored injuries.</p>\n<h4>Healing Critical Wounds</h4>\n<p>If you have received any Critical Wounds, you are said to be Critically Wounded. Critical Wounds can be very serious. Refer to the appropriate Critical Table to see exactly what penalties you suffer for any Critical Wounds sustained. Critical Wounds do not count as healed until all conditions they inflict are removed, and all non-permanent negative modifiers are resolved. When you are Critically Wounded, you may still heal your Wounds using the normal rules.</p>\n<h3><strong>Medical Attention</strong></h3>\n<p>Several Critical Wound results and conditions cannot be resolved until you receive medical attention. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Successful use of the Heal skill.</li>\n<li>Application of a bandage, healing poultice, or similar.</li>\n<li>Successful use of a spell or prayer that heals Wounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Surgery</strong></h4>\n<p>Some wounds are beyond simple stitching and foul-smelling poultices. If you suffer a Critical Wound where surgery is required to attend to it (it will be marked: Surgery), you suffer the marked penalties until you visit an appropriately trained doctor or barber-surgeon, or somehow source a magical or divine surgery equivalent.</p>\n<p>Further, if you suffer an amputated body part, you cannot heal 1 of the suffered Wounds until a surgeon successfully treats it with a Heal Test. For more information on surgery, refer to the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.NP4EHyyh1yOLbsPU]{Surgery} talent.</p>","folder":"KBFMpqeeMFWhdpSI","sort":500001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"}}}
{"_id":"7b3n85kojlLKSpkT","name":"Initial Inquiries: Gotthard von Wittgenstein","content":"<p>The name of von Wittgenstein means nothing to anyone in Middenheim: the family’s castle and lands are too far away for the name to be familiar, and Gotthard adopted the alias ‘@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}’ when he moved to the city. Further, the Characters have only a vague idea of what he looks like from a portrait they may have seen @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.1wRb1a5Tku2t0UvL]{in the castle}. This need not be the case, however. Though it is certainly desirable that the Characters do not identify him too soon, the search for the last of the Wittgensteins can add depth and intrigue to the adventure, and offer you some ways to help a party that is having difficulty.</p>\n<p>There are several carnival events at which the Characters might catch a glimpse of Gotthard: all are listed on his NPC card, and all are attended by other major NPCs, whose acquaintance the Characters may be keen to make — especially as the week goes on. While Gotthard is not particularly friendly with any of the others, a party following them around will certainly have a chance to see him. While his face may not be familiar, any character who comes within 2 yd or so may be allowed a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test to notice that he wears a ring with the Wittgenstein coat of arms on the little finger of his right hand. The Character  remembers seeing the same coat of arms in Castle Wittgenstein, and may also remember that in his portrait, Gotthard wore the same ring.</p>\n<p>If a chance encounter seems too random, then the Characters might see Gotthard at an event — the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party} would be ideal — subjecting one of the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{ladies-at-court} to unwelcome attention. Spurred by gallantry — and by the desire to place an influential NPC in their debt — the Characters go to the rescue, spotting the telltale ring in the process.</p>\n<p>Another option is to encounter Gotthard through his involvement with the @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{Jade Sceptre cult}. Having learned of the cult’s existence from a captured Purple Hand cultist (see above) or by some other means, the Characters may conclude from Gotthard’s letter to his sister, and from the chapel to Slaanesh in the castle, that Gotthard is likely to be a member. Careful investigation could lead the Characters to the location of a private party: watching the place, they may see Gotthard going in.</p>\n<p>Armed with the knowledge that the city’s most influential merchant is a member of a cursed family masquerading under a false name, and/or that he is a member of a Slaanesh-worshipping Chaos cult, the Characters may decide to approach him and threaten blackmail. This leads to the question: what exactly do they want with Gotthard? The party might not have thought of this until now, but he can tell them little about his family that they do not already know, having been away for so long. If he learns that his family is dead and their castle destroyed, Gotthard takes any opportunity to get away. He hires assassins to kill the Characters, and remains in hiding until he is sure they have succeeded.</p>\n<h3>The Wallenstein Identity</h3>\n<p>Ideally, the Characters should learn of Gotthard’s true identity early on Festag night, at a time when they are preoccupied with the main plot of the adventure. If they see him out and about, it is always in crowded public places where they have little chance of approaching him directly.</p>\n<p>Once they learn that ‘Wallenstein’ is the chairman of an influential guild and a powerful city Komission, they realise — with the aid of a <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Law)</strong> or similar Test if necessary — that it would be very unwise to accuse such a prominent citizen of anything without overwhelming proof, and several other prominent citizens to back them up.</p>\n<p>Since he publicly supports the new taxes, the Characters would do well to begin their investigation of him there, especially if they already know or suspect that the Purple Hand is involved in the taxes (see above). This strategy enables them to gather evidence before making an accusation, and along the way they  are able to make the acquaintance of other powerful NPCs, and discover the plot to replace @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris}.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A DASH OF PARANOIA</em></h3>\n<p><em>While the Jade Sceptre doesn’t share the Purple Hand's penchant for colour coordination, your players may not realise this.

The Garden Party provides an opportunity for Characters to engage in this kind of activity, and while it may feel that little is being accomplished, be sure to gauge your players attitude to events. If they are enjoying themselves sneaking about the hedge maze, drinking with Luigi or gossiping with Petra, allow things to proceed. If, however, they seem at a loose end, be prepared to move things along. Hint at some of the key intrigues which contribute to the plot — the Graf's troubled mind, Ar-Ulric's affair, or Deiter's bizarre habit of repeating himself over the matter of the taxes, and move on. </em></p>\n<p><em>This is good advice to keep in mind during any of the Carnival's events. <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> was designed with the knowledge that not every group of Characters will see everything that is to be seen and uncover every detail of the plot. There are many paths to gaining influence with the Graf, and it is intended that each group find their own way to the core of the plot. If your players seem disinterested in one event, let them peruse the carnival calendar. There is certain to be something that draws their eye, and other opportunities will arise for the plot to bubble to the surface.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Mingling</h4>\n<p>Most of the guests at the garden party are here to mingle. Throughout the event guests wander about the garden, briefly and politely acknowledging other guests. In general it is considered polite to allow those of noble birth to decide whether or not to continue a conversation beyond a brief greeting. So burghers, artisans, performers, and the like tend to wander around at a fairly brisk pace, networking briefly with people they encounter, whilst aristocrats engage in deeper conversation if they feel like it. Characters would be wise to know that complaining about being treated with snobbish disregard is a good way to be asked to leave the party.</p>\n<p>Characters who mingle may still overhear some interesting titbit of information, though not from the mouths of any major NPC. A character who announces they are going to spend half an hour mingling should make a<strong> Hard (–20) Gossip</strong> Test and refer to the Mingle Outcome table (this becomes an <strong>Easy (+40) Gossip </strong>Test if the character has the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (Nobles)} Talent). If multiple characters mingle successfully at once they gain multiple pieces of information, rather than just overhearing the same snippet. Refer to @JournalEntry[ri289tDcFl3qOsaT]{rumours} from <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> if you need extra things to overhear.</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.0712%;height:171px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:27px\">\n<td style=\"width:99.5314%;height:27px\" colspan=\"3\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">MINGLE OUTCOME TABLE</h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:11.6005%;height:16px;text-align:center\"><strong>SL</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:21.354%;height:16px;text-align:center\"><strong>Result</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:66.5769%;height:16px\"><strong>Consequences</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:11.6005%;height:16px;text-align:center\">+6 or more</td>\n<td style=\"width:21.354%;height:16px;text-align:center\">Astounding Success</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.5769%;height:16px\">\n<p>The Character overhears Emmeline Helstein, a local noblewoman, discussing recent events with Abu Tawb, a diplomatic envoy from the Spice Port of Copher.

{"_id":"7yPxqLqUFRNauqHG","name":"Into The Sewers","content":"<p>Beneath the hole, a rusty, iron-runged ladder leads down a narrow shaft for 10 yards or so, finally emerging in a rough-hewn stone corridor. The course of the adventure from this point depends very much on what has happened to Tavelli.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} Escaped</h3>\n<p>If he has successfully managed to escape down the shaft, he returns to Skretth immediately and reports what has happened. He only mentions the Characters if they are pursuing him, giving the Skaven time to ready for the Characters and step up the guard around the sacrificial chamber, so that when the time for the ritual (midnight) comes, it is much harder for the Characters to ruin it.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} Killed</h3>\n<p>If the Characters killed Tavelli, or if he killed himself, he will not be missed for some time — with the impending sacrifice, the Skaven have more important things to worry about.</p>\n<p>@Actor[XviXu9z4RMAv0tmo]{Skretth’s} experiments have not been going well. He really has no idea how to achieve his goal, and he is beginning to worry that his followers will soon lose patience. Apart from anything else, he is constantly under the influence of Mandrake, and rational thought (in so far as a Grey Seer is ever capable of it) is far beyond him.</p>\n<p>The guard around the sacrificial chamber is not increased, and consequently the Characters’ task is made a little easier. Any attempt to impersonate Tavelli by wearing his clothes imparts a +20 bonus to any relevant Skill: the Skaven have difficulty telling one Man-thing from another, and they can seldom be bothered to try. Even so, there are several parts of the complex where Humans are not permitted, and trying to enter them will arouse suspicion. The cultists know exactly where they can and cannot go.</p>\n<h3>What Now?</h3>\n<p>From this point on, the action is dependent on where the Characters go. They are racing against time, so the GM should keep a careful record of elapsed game time.</p>\n<p>The rock corridor in which the Characters are standing is pitch black, without enough light for Night Vision to be effective. They will be spending some time underground, so the party risks becoming stranded in the sewers in the dark if they do not take enough oil or spare torches. If the Characters decide to turn back to acquire light sources, remember that the ritual begins at midnight.</p>\n<p>The corridor and branching passages are, rather disturbingly, filled with the echoes of strange, far-off noises. The walls glisten with moisture, and a greenish slime is present in some places. The air is distinctly cool. The GM should try to convey an atmosphere of foreboding.</p>\n<p>The corridor is quite low (about 6 feet high), so tall Characters have to duck to avoid hitting their heads against the ceiling. The floor is covered with a shallow layer of slippery mud: any movement faster than walking speed requires an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test to avoid falling over.</p>\n<h4>They Went Thataway</h4>\n<p>A clear trail marks the path taken by the cultists: no Test is necessary to make it out. There are two sets of footprints, with two continuous, roughly parallel furrows between them. A successful <strong>Easy (+40) Track </strong>Test leads a Character to conclude that the furrows were made by the heels of someone who was unconscious or overpowered, being dragged backwards by the elbows between two abductors.</p>\n<p>The tracks eventually lead to a dead end: a wall of moist, smooth stonework. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test reveals a scratched design in the wall, which an <strong>Average (+20) Secret Signs (Thief) </strong>Test identifies as meaning ‘push’. Pushing the wall at this point opens a secret door leading into the sewers. The door may be closed by pushing the stone as it protrudes from the other side: it repositions the counterweight mechanism that opens the door.</p>\n<h4>Wandering off the Trail</h4>\n<p>Should the party decide to ignore the obvious trail (see below) and take one of the side passageways instead, they soon become lost in the labyrinth of @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Middenheim’s Undercity}: a terrifying, twisting maze that winds away in every direction. No further details of the side branches are given, but if needed, you can find more information on the Undercity in <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</strong>. It should quickly become clear to the Characters that the further into the tunnels they go, the more danger they face. All manner of pitfalls and wandering, mutated creatures await the unwary, and the party could wander endlessly, slowly dying of starvation, lack of water, and festering wounds.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>DIGGING TOO DEEP</em></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">@JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{The Undercity} of Middenheim is vast. Beneath the upper areas carefully, and often thanklessly, patrolled by the dwarfs, lie ancient warrens carved by the first settlers of the Fauschlag. These halls are home to many horrors, as discussed above. Various elemental creatures drawn to the place by the strength of Ghur in Middenheim stalk the caverns, and give pause even to the Skaven.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Beneath these layers is the Skaven den of @JournalEntry[YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim}. Discussed in more detail in <strong>Middednheim: City of the White Wolf</strong>, these halls are ruled by a triumvirate of tyrants whose cruelty is all but unmatched. Should the Characters make it this far they are all but certain to die without the expenditure of a Fate point. Be sure to give the Characters plenty of warning that they are threading towards danger — foul smells, interminable sounds, and the skittering of many unseen paws over stone floors should abound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Should the Characters proceed all the same, feel free to throw any number of Skaven and Skaven-bred monstrosities at them. Regardless of their skill, armaments, or preparations they may have taken, no small group of Characters can hope to take on Skavendom directly and survive. If you are feeling generous allow them a glimpse at the vast and terrifying caverns full of uncountable rat-men, and then start looking at the Character's Doomings to see what sort of fate the Skaven are planning for each of them.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">If they do decide to run, there are reasons to be merciful. The Skaven will give chase, but not into the upper caverns patrolled by Dwarfs or filled with horrors even the Skaven wish to avoid. While this may be a case of 'out of the frying pan and into the fire', most Characters will stand a better chance facing off against a single monstrosity than against a veritable tide of well-armed vermin.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Dark, Damp, and Deadly Locations</h3>\n<p>The major encounter areas are detailed below. As the whole area below the cellar has been taken over by the Skaven and their servants, there is an 80% chance of encountering someone or something for every 10 minutes spent here. Roll 1d10 and consult the @Table[sewer-locations] table, or choose an option you prefer.</p>\n<h4>1. Sewer Entrance</h4>\n<p>The secret door leads into the sewers proper. The walls are made of dull grey stone and glisten with moisture (although this time there is no slime). The sewers, like the corridor leading into them, are pitch dark. In this part of the system, the sewers are roughly 10 feet wide, including narrow stone walkways 2 and a half feet wide, on each side of the effluent channel. The channel is 5 feet deep and half-filled with slow-flowing muck. See @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.pXSQdRzX2VCa8zMG]{Adventuring In The Sewers} in <strong>Enemy in Shadows </strong>for advanced rules and more ideas on exploring sewers.</p>\n<p>A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Track</strong> Test allows the party to follow the route taken by the cultists to the second secret door. Even if this is not successful, the Characters realise on a successful <strong>Easy (+40) Intelligence</strong> Test that although it is possible for one person to leap or wade the effluent channel, it would be practically impossible for two men dragging an unconscious or dead person, and any attempt to do so would certainly leave some sort of trail. Therefore, their quarry must have kept to this side of the channel. To the left, the channel could go on for some way, maybe even forking once or twice. However, due to other effluent channels crossing the path, or build-ups of detritus that would have given away anyone passing through, it should be obvious that the abductors did not pass this way.</p>\n<h4>2. The Ghoul</h4>\n<p>The party sees a humanoid body slumped face down over the walkway, one arm dangling over the edge. It is dressed in rags, and lies unmoving. The figure is, in fact, a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.6B7LMdYtunAftsFN]{Crypt Ghoul}, which was attracted here by the smell of dead Human flesh. It began to explore the area, but came across a Skaven patrol that attacked it immediately. The Skaven easily overpowered the miserable creature and left it for dead. However, it is currently on the verge of regaining consciousness. The Crypt Ghoul currently has 4 Wounds remaining.</p>\n<p>The Ghoul does not come to unless one of the Characters touches it. Due to previous Critical Hits inflicted by the Skaven patrol, it cannot walk, and must remain @Condition[Prone]. Even if the Characters kill it, it serves one useful purpose: to indicate that the abductors did not come this far. It would clearly have been impossible to drag an unconscious Human past even a wounded Ghoul.</p>\n<h4>3. Entrance to Skaven Den</h4>\n<p>The secret door opens into a rock corridor branching off to the right. The trail disappears into the wall here. If the Characters have lost the trail due to a failed Track Test, a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test is required to find the secret door. If the Characters miss the door and continue past, have a patrol of Skaven (as above) exit through the secret door as they are about to pass it by again after dealing with the Ghoul.</p>\n<p>The corridor beyond slopes upwards at a steep angle (evident to anyone entering it), levelling out as it reaches the guard chamber (see below). Halfway along, just before the bend in the passage, is a tripwire. Any Character approaching it spots it on a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test. If it goes undetected, each Character passing by it must make a <strong>Difficult (–10) Agility</strong> Test or unwittingly trigger it.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Measures</strong></p>\n<p>If the tripwire is triggered, two things happen: a bell rings in the guard chamber, alerting the cultists there; and a small glass globe drops to the floor, releasing a yellowish gas that initially fills a 2-yard radius centred on the unfortunate who triggered the trap. The gas spreads another 2 yards in all directions each Round for [[/r 1d10]] halved Rounds. Anyone caught in the gas must pass a <strong>Hard (–20) Toughness</strong> Test or fall unconscious for [[/r 1d10]] minutes — they may repeat this test if they suffer more wounds than their <strong>Toughness Bonus</strong>.</p>\n<p>After the gas has dispersed (which takes as many Rounds as it took to spread), the guards from area 4 take any unconscious Characters and throw them in the cells in area 6. If any Characters are unaffected by the gas, the guards seek to subdue them with their clubs: all have Strike to Stun. They avoid killing the Characters due to Skretth’s instructions to acquire sacrificial victims.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are subdued, refer to <strong>Captured!</strong> below.</p>\n<h4>4. Guard Chamber</h4>\n<p>This rough-hewn cavern serves as the common room and guard chamber for the Skaven’s cultist servants. There are a couple of tables and some chairs in the north-eastern part of the room; two sets of bone dice and a pack of cards lie on the tables. Illumination is provided by four torches mounted on the walls.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} managed to escape, he is here (unless the party is hot on his trail, in which case he is in area 9, reporting to @Actor[XviXu9z4RMAv0tmo]{Skretth}).</p>\n<p>There are 2–8 @Actor[DfOuLQkGzWUZPTXI]{Yellow Fang Cultists} in the room at all times. Their actions depend on whether or not the party triggers the tripwire in area 3. If they have avoided it, the guards are sitting at the table playing cards and the Characters can Surprise them, gaining Advantage. The guards are naturally suspicious, making any opposed <strong>Charm/Cool</strong> Test <strong>Difficult (–10)</strong> for the Characters if they try to bluff their way through instead of fighting.</p>\n<p>These guards know @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli}, and if one of the Characters is wearing the cultist’s clothes, the guards immediately recognise them as an imposter.</p>\n<p>The noise of any fighting here alerts the Skaven sentries in area 7, who attempt to ambush and capture any intruders who come into their area (the Skaven Surprise the Characters when they enter).</p>\n<h4>5. Armoury and Store Room</h4>\n<p>This small cave serves as a makeshift armoury for the guards in area 4. It contains five @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.1zaqojk0Oq1m8vYv]{Swords}, six @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.ahlxlfIl8xUhBkic]{Daggers}, three @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.1zaqojk0Oq1m8vYv]{Hand Axes}, two flasks of oil, two @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.aVLjCqY3guj1DD06]{tinderboxes}, and eleven torches. The weapons are all arranged in wooden weapon racks set against the walls, and the torches, oil, and tinderboxes are stacked neatly in a corner.</p>\n<h4>6. Corridor and Cells</h4>\n<p>This dismal corridor is accessible from the guardroom by a sturdy oak door. There are nine cells, each with a small barred window in the door. It requires a <strong>Difficult (–10) Strength</strong> Test to break down a door, or a successful Extended (3 SL) <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Test to pick the lock on any door. Of course, the jailer has the keys to the cells.</p>\n<p>Only seven of these cells are used as such. The westernmost cell holds any equipment taken from captured Characters, and is always locked. The easternmost cell is the jailer’s den, crudely furnished with a chair and a makeshift table on which stands a bottle of cheap Estalian wine. The other cells are rat-infested holes with damp straw on the floor in place of a bed. The only light comes from a single lantern hanging in the corridor.</p>\n<h4>7. Junction</h4>\n<p>The northern passageway from the guard room splits into two at this point. Standing at the junction are two @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.F1vAZZcmVKkRw8xn]{Clanrat} sentries. Humans are only allowed past them if they have been sent for by @Actor[XviXu9z4RMAv0tmo]{Skretth}— the Characters will either have to bluff or fight their way past. These Skaven believe that no pathetic Man-thing would dare go to Skretth uninvited, so they are not too difficult to bluff, requiring only a successful <strong>Average (+20) Charm </strong>Test. Fighting here alerts Skretth if he is in his chamber.</p>\n<h4>8. Shrine</h4>\n<p>The shrine consists of an altar flanked by two crudely sculpted statues of the Horned Rat, standing about 8 feet tall. The symbol of three bones forming an inverted triangle has been chiselled into the rock wall behind the rough stone altar. The roof is supported by four stone columns, and there is a small pit in front of the altar where the sniveling Skaven throw offerings to their deity. The pit is a natural narrow shaft, about 3 feet in diameter, which disappears downward out of sight. If anything is lost in here, the shaft is effectively bottomless; if a Character falls in, they become wedged about 4 feet down, and need to be pulled out. Any Tests made to rescue a Character or climb out are <strong>Challenging (+0).</strong></p>\n<h4>9. Skretth’s Chamber</h4>\n<p>Two @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.F1vAZZcmVKkRw8xn]{Clanrats} stand guard at the entrance. Unless the Characters arrive during the ritual (whose victim will be Klauss Dralst), @Actor[XviXu9z4RMAv0tmo]{Skretth} is here. Skretth’s mental state has deteriorated through his growing addiction to @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.5fowsr8vslorjeB2]{Mandrake} and the continued failure of his experiments. He spends more and more time here isolated from the rest of the group in ‘think-think time’. </p>\n<p>The only contents of the room, scattered haphazardly across the floor, are some foodstuffs, a shield, half a dozen unrefined Mandrake roots, and a small jar containing a dozen doses of Skretth’s Mandrake snuff. In addition, Skretth’s grimoire is here unless he is conducting the ritual.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><em>The Magic Ring</em></h3>\n<p><em>Somewhere in the course of his career, Skretth picked up a magical ring that casts the Necromancy spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.7BJDTRG65hwt1fUK]{Reanimate} with +6 SL. It has enough magical power to cast the spell twice: if he has no other choice, Skretth uses the ring to animate the corpses in area 12, turning them into @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies}.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>10. Robing Chamber</h4>\n<p>Skretth uses this room to prepare himself for the rituals. Two robes hang from pegs driven into the stone walls. One is black with a red lining: this is the robe Skretth uses when he performs his futile ritual. The other is white, torn, and bloodstained. Victims are dressed in this just prior to the ceremony. A sacrificial dagger lays on a natural shelf on the stone wall unless the ceremony is under way.</p>\n<h4>11. End of the Tunnel</h4>\n<p>The tunnel ends at this point, dropping away to the sewer some 7 yards below. A rope bridge spans the chasm, ending in another tunnel mouth that leads away into the darkness. A rough staircase is carved into the rock on the southern side of the gap, allowing the Skaven access to the sewer system by their own route — they prefer to avoid contact with the Humans whenever they can.</p>\n<h4>12. The Sacrificial Chamber</h4>\n<p>This huge, natural cavern is dominated by a carving of the Horned Rat on the northern wall. At the north end of the cavern is a bloodstained granite block with an iron ring set into it. The south end is bare except for two pillars supporting the entrance to the tunnel. This is where the Skaven assemble to attend the ritual. A torch in a wall bracket provides illumination: the light cast is sufficient for Skaven eyes, but Characters without @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.x0WMGwuQzReXcQrs]{Night Vision} or a light source of their own can only see dimly.</p>\n<p>All the Skaven attend the rituals, by Skretth’s command. When everyone is assembled, Skretth stands at the head of the block and leads the group in a chant: a noise so loud it can be heard as far away as area 3. This lasts for about a minute, increasing in volume and speed until the Skaven are worked up into a frenzy. The Skaven kill the victims at this point, then they fall silent, waiting for something (they are not sure what) to happen.</p>\n<p>Nothing happens. After a moment of uncomfortable silence, the body is dragged away into a corner. The six most recent victims lie here.</p>\n<p>If the adventurers reach the chamber before the ritual begins at midnight, Klauss is bound to the iron ring, a rope around his wrists, dressed only in the white robe from area 10 and too exhausted to cry for help. He is unguarded.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have to interrupt the ritual to save Klauss, the odds are against them. There may be up to a dozen Skaven in the cavern (all @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.F1vAZZcmVKkRw8xn]{Clanrats}, though you may wish to add a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.kl4qHg0mqWOApBqH]{Stormvermin} or two if you feel the Characters need an additional challenge), and these may be enough to overpower the Characters. If the party also has to deal with six @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies} raised using Skretth’s magic ring, they could be in trouble. Unless…</p>\n<p>Remember those bombs in the house? They might be enough to even the odds in a fight, or they might bring the cavern down on everyone’s head. Sensible Players should be able to use them to cover the Characters’ retreat if they find themselves outclassed.</p>\n<h2>CAPTURED!</h2>\n<p>If the Skaven capture the Characters, they are stripped of their possessions (which are placed in the westernmost cell of area 6) and tossed into different cells until Skretth is ready to use them in a future ritual. They can shout to one another from their cells, and the Players may use this opportunity to discuss wild and unlikely escape plans. However, as the jailer is exceptionally dim-witted, all they have to do is think up a remotely convincing story, succeeding at an <strong>Easy (+40) Charm</strong> Test, and @Actor[sRBnbhLgu3bBM3cq]{Tigrati}, the jailer, simply opens a door. A well-placed kick and a swift grab for the key could leave him in the cell, and a Character outside with the keys.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/yellow-fang-cultist.webp","folder":"cgVwF73JqHGJFy4a","sort":325000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Ritual","sort":325000}}}

{"_id":"8CaBRBSeYH6bFGEQ","name":"Maubast","content":"<p>Maubast is a small but wealthy village of 48 souls (and their children). Map 2 details the local area and Map 3 shows the village proper. In addition to a farmhouse, each household has a large fermenting shed where casks of wine are stored and the grapes are pressed. Bottles of the better vintages are usually kept in cellars beneath the farmhouses.</p>\n<p>Livestock is limited to a few pigs, goats, and hens. The latter are allowed to wander freely and spend a lot of their time scratching around the northwest area of the village, since this is where people are buried and the worms grow fat as a result.</p>\n<p>Surrounding the village are vineyards grown on man-made terraces that have been cleared from the forest; the wine produced provides the sole source of income for the inhabitants. Maubast Reisling is a light delicate wine that is gaining in popularity throughout Parravon. In recent years harvests have been particularly good and the village has prospered as a result: buildings and carts are in a good state of repair, animals are sturdy, and the people are well fed. Surprisingly (to some) the village does not have an inn, and socialising takes the form of frequent “wine-tastings” at one house or another; this is a very closely knit community. By far the most popular sessions take place at the home of Henri-Phillippe Rocheteau, the Mayor of Maubast.</p>\n<p>The village is at its busiest during the grape harvest, and the timing of this is crucial to the village’s continued prosperity. The grapes must be picked within a 7-day period, if the wine is to be at its best. Judging just when to start requires years of experience, and the adventurers arrive just two days before the harvest of this year’s crop must begin if the wine is not to be ruined. Migrant workers from the surrounding areas have yet to arrive but some wine merchants have already visited. The grapes have been assessed, and prospects look good—provided the harvest starts on time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Arriving in Maubast</h2>\n<p>The rough track from Parravon emerges from the forest to reveal a small valley, intensively cultivated with acre upon acre of healthy-looking vines. If the party is travelling with Hans Krug they will hear a grunt of surprise. If they enquire further the farmer will state his curiosity that nobody is working the vineyards. The GM should assume that the PCs arrive on Day 0; events are timed accordingly.</p>\n<p>Arriving in the village proper (across a well-maintained but rather inadequate ditch), the PCs will be struck by both its prosperity and quietness. A couple of houses have crude planks nailed across the windows, and large sprays of flowers on the front doors. A successful Challenging (–10%) Common Knowledge (the Empire) Skill Test will reveal they are “nanny’s fingers” generally considered to ward off evil spirits. The doors of these houses are also inscribed with meaningless symbols, but it requires a successful Secret Signs (Ranger) Skill Test to appreciate that they are indeed meaningless.</p>\n<p>Travelling further with Krug or general investigation will reveal that all the villagers are attending a meeting outside the house of Henri-Phillippe. The scene is quite confusing, with many people speaking and shouting at once. Things will quiet down when strangers are spotted, and at this stage the villagers will be wary of newcomers and act accordingly.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of the lull, Henri-Philippe will speak. “Look, there’s no point arguing until we’ve all calmed down and can discuss things rationally. And there’s no sense blaming people without cause.” At this there is a general murmur of dissent, but Henri-Phillippe continues. “Everyone go home and we’ll meet again in a couple of hours.” This is met with broad approval and the villagers begin to disperse. If the PCs arrived with Krug, the farmer and assistants will drop them off and continue on their way (but not before visiting the local store to find out what’s going on).</p>\n<p>Once the meeting is concluded, Henri-Phillippe will be free to greet the party, and reference should be made to his description in the NPC listing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Recent Events</h2>\n<p>A little over a month ago a child, Seel Baldurich, came running into the village having seen “a ghost” in the woods (see Sighting 1 on Map 3a, and Seel’s entry in the NPC listing). Seel is well known in the village for his various tall tales and this one was put down to imagination. However, a few weeks later, Isolde Guderian was out collecting fruit when she noticed a skull sitting on a branch. The skull did not move but when she returned with a couple of militiamen the skull had gone (see Sighting 2). The villagers did not take her seriously. However, three days ago two farm workers, Sigismund Halsbret and Knud Gropenfrotteur, both claimed to have seen a “glowing skull” floating in the woods while out working (see Sighting 3). This was taken seriously, but a fullscale search by the militia failed to reveal any clues.</p>\n<p>Finally, on the morning of the PCs’ arrival, Erietta Surhardt was attacked, again while working the vines. Three other workers heard her scream and rushed over to where Erietta was last seen. They discovered her unconscious and bleeding, but worse still, a skull was resting on her body (see Sighting 4). The skull took to the air, but instead of attacking flew off into the forest. Erietta was carried back and now lies in the Rocheteau house, attended by Elisabet.</p>\n<p>An already frightened village had gathered to “do something” when it was noted that Sigismund Halsbret (one of the witnesses in Sighting 3), was missing. A search of the village has failed to find him and this has unnerved the villagers further. (Actually, a very scared Sigismund left secretly before dawn. He had no relatives in the village and decided to pack his bags and run.) With the grape harvest due to begin in 2 days time, the villagers are now worried about their livelihood: they are frightened to go into the fields, and migrant workers are sure to hear of events and stay away.</p>\n<p>All the above is common knowledge, but the PCs are likely to obtain a more coherent version from Henri-Philippe. Speculation in the village is rife and it will be recalled how a young wine merchant disappeared a few years ago. In addition, there are various rumours/explanations of recent events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The graves of dead warriors from an ancient battle have been disturbed by clearing the forest. Local rumour, based on truth, has it that a Chaos hoard from the Drakwald Forest was slain over to the southwest. Perhaps some were also slain near Pritzstock?</li>\n<li>The skulls have been sent as a punishment from the gods for not making proper sacrifice in respect of the recent excellent harvests.</li>\n<li>Henri-Phillippe is somehow involved in order to buy land cheap when all the villagers have left or been killed. Who else has the capital to buy land?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last rumour is the blackest and will only be spoken if things are getting very bad (and Henri-Phillippe isn’t around).</p>\n<p>The villagers are also angry that the militia has not done anything to stop the skulls and this has created some bad feeling between people. Just what the militia (four farmers and a warrior) are supposed to do nobody says, but that doesn’t stop them from complaining.</p>","folder":"jsAKzmzu9XIh3Q9e","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

To Plan your new trapping, you first decide the trappings you wish to combine to create your invention. As examples, Pistols have been combined with other Pistols to create Repeating Pistols, and Pigeons and been combined with Bombs to create Pigeon Bombs. Let your imagination go wild. Once you have your plan, it’s time to make the blueprints, which costs 1 Endeavour to attempt. Take a <strong>Trade (Engineer)</strong> Test, with a Difficulty set by how outlandish your proposed trapping combination is as determined by the GM. If you succeed, you are ready to start Building. Each SL scored adds +1 SL to the attempt to build your invention, as the plans are well laid out and easy to follow.</p>\n<p>To Build the invention, you must either undertake a @JournalEntry[T1b7XyyA4bleKgch]{Crafting} or @JournalEntry[AOA5HIAVu5ye2c6a]{Commission} Endeavour. If it’s Crafting , you are building the item yourself, and you must have the appropriate Skills to do so for the trappings being combined; so, if you were combining Pigeons with Bombs, you would need Animal Training and Trade (Explosives). The Difficulty to craft the invention is always <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong>, and the SL is set as normal. The raw materials needed to build the invention cost twice the listed price for the trappings being combined, and have an Availability rating equal to the most scarce of the trappings used in your invention. If you Commission the invention, you will likely need to undertake a Consult an Expert Endeavour first to find someone with the required Skills. That done, follow the Commission Endeavour as normal; it costs six times the listed price for the trappings to be combined to commission the work.

Village locations are typically buildings. <strong>Examples: </strong><em>Quiet Tavern (The Empty Bottle); Pig Farm (Hertl&rsquo;s Farm).</em></p>\n<p>In step #7, each new location is related to a Boon or Bane that was added in previous rounds. <strong>Examples:</strong> <em>The Quiet Tavern is a meeting place for Rebel Outlaws (Friendly Neighbours); the Pig Farm is fortified against Goblin Raiders (Outside Threat).</em></p>\n<h3>NPCs</h3>\n<p>Each NPC is described with an adjective, profession and first name. Surnames can be added later if the player cannot think of one right away. NPCs may be related to a Location but it&rsquo;s not a requirement. <strong>Examples:</strong> <em>Boastful Baker (Martina), Dirty Layabout (Goff).</em></p>\n<p>In step #8, each new NPC is related to a Boon or Bane that was added in previous rounds. <strong>Examples:</strong> <em>Martina&rsquo;s cardamom bread is sought by Local Traders (Income Source); Goff is one of the baron&rsquo;s Illegitimate Children (Inside Scandal).</em></p>\n<h3>Boons</h3>\n<p>Boons benefit a majority of the villagers either directly or indirectly. In addition to being recorded on the roster sheet, Boons might also be drawn on the map or indicated with arrows as off-map locations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Income Source:</strong> Natural resources, geographic advantages or trade routes that stimulate local industry. Details can be added later. <strong>Examples:</strong> <em>Iron Mine; Fertile Soil; River Port.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Local Tradition:</strong> Cultural or religious practices that increase prestige, unity or divine favour. Basic details are noted in parentheses to be fleshed out later. <strong>Examples:</strong> <em>Minor Deity (River Spirit); Work Ethic; Superstition (Warding Charms).</em></li>\n<li><strong>Friendly Neighbours:</strong> NPCs that protect or aid the village.&nbsp;Indicate with arrows pointing off-map. Details can be added later. <strong>Examples: </strong><em>Rebel Outlaws, Sigmarite Monastery, Hedgefolk.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Banes</h3>\n<p>Banes disadvantage the entire village. Most Banes are recorded on the roster sheet only.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Outside Threat:</strong> Monsters or NPCs that threaten the village. Can be indicated with arrows pointing off-map. <strong>Examples:</strong><em> Goblin Raiders; Rival Noble Lord; Hostile Wood Elves.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Inside Scandal:</strong> Internal drama that creates trouble or divides the village into factions. <strong>Examples: </strong><em>Blasphemous Cult; Controversial Mutations; Family Feud.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Bad Reputation: </strong>Regional prejudice which may or may not be deserved. Villagers are judged negatively by association. <strong>Examples: </strong><em>Heretical Beliefs; Inbreeding; Swindlers.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Random Elements</h3>\n<p>Random elements are generated by rolling 1d10 for an adjective, and another 1d10 for the person, place or event. Each table can therefore generate 100 possible combinations.</p>\n<p>Players can alternate rolling for random elements, or the GM can roll them all. The group might need a minute or two for contextual discussion. The GM can expedite this process by offering suggestions and arbitrating disagreements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Terrain Feature:</strong> Terrain is usually drawn by the GM at the edge of the village map. Large features such as swamps or forests might extend a great distance off-map.</li>\n<li><strong>Local Lord:</strong> The GM decides upon a name. The Local Lord&rsquo;s estate or castle is usually indicated with an arrow pointing off-map. Smaller castles, belonging to barons or minor lords, can be drawn on the map if players desire closer proximity to their landlord.</li>\n<li><strong>Recent Event:</strong> Recent Events are recorded on the roster sheet. The group should relate the rolled event to an existing village element. More detail can be added later.</li>\n<li><strong>Notable Wildlife:</strong> Notable Wildlife is recorded on the roster sheet. Other wild animals that populate the environs can be added later.</li>\n<li><strong>Current Visitor:</strong> The GM decides upon a name. Current Visitors are recorded on the roster sheet and developed later by the GM.</li>\n<li><strong>Latest Gossip</strong>: Latest Gossip is recorded on the roster sheet. The incident has not yet affected the village, but it might soon. Details are developed later by the GM.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Extra Details</h3>\n<p>Step #10 of the Creation Turn Sequence involves group brainstorming to fill in missing details. Players edit the roster sheet while the GM modifies the map. Determine whether the settlement is a Small, Medium or Large Village, or a Small Town, so the GM can draw an appropriate number of extra houses on the map. NPCs without Locations are assigned to houses at this stage. Players are now ready to consider the village as a whole and make notes about its local government, religion and guilds.</p>\n<p><strong>Government:</strong> Most villages are ruled by the Local Lord who employs a bailiff for law enforcement and tax collection.</p>\n<p>However, village affairs are managed by residents themselves.</p>\n<p>Small and medium villages are usually governed by a council led by an elder. Large villages and small towns may be governed by a council of elders, an elected mayor or a council of burghers. Players decide which NPCs are involved in village government and note their roles on the roster sheet. If the ruling lord&rsquo;s castle is on the map, there might be no village government at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Villagers typically worship multiple gods, with favoured deities varying according to circumstance and season. Taal and Rhya are popular in rural villages. Handrich and Ranald are worshipped in villages located near cities.</p>\n<p>Ulric is generally dominant in the northern Empire; Sigmar in the south. If the village includes a chapel, its patron is probably the locally dominant god. Players decide which gods are favoured and indicate whether villagers are united or divided in their worship. Off-map temples, monasteries and holy orders are detailed by the GM.</p>\n<p><strong>Guilds:</strong> Small and medium villages rarely contain enough tradespeople to justify guilds. Large villages can sometimes support one guild representing the most popular local trade.</p>\n<p>Small towns can support between two to four guilds. Village tradespeople are often represented by guilds located in a nearby town or city. The GM decides which town or city is nearest the village, and draws an arrow pointing off-map.</p>\n<p>Players then decide which guilds are locally influential. Guild memberships are recorded on the village roster and applicable character sheets.</p>\n<h2>Finishing the Sheet</h2>\n<p>Settlement defences are based on a combination of Settlement Size and Defence Rating. Defence Rating is a simple numeric value representing threats to the village and the resources at its disposal. Defence Rating is calculated by adding together the number of &lsquo;Income Source&rsquo; Boons and &lsquo;Outside Threat&rsquo; Banes from creation steps #5-6.</p>\n<p><strong>Example: </strong><em>The village was created by five players (Large Village). It includes two Income Sources (Local Traders &amp; Fertile Soil) and one Outside Threat (Goblin Raiders). The village&rsquo;s Defence Rating is therefore &lsquo;3&rsquo;, giving it a wooden stockade plus 3 enhancements of the group&rsquo;s choice. The players choose ramparts, stakes, and a tower.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Defence Rating (DR)</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(Income Sources + Outside Threats)<span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Bold;

Their apartment is well defended, for Sreluc still suspects the day when the Dwarfs of Ubersreik come for him and his brother. The front door is reinforced <strong>(Very Hard (&minus;30) Strength</strong> Test to break down) and is bolted from the inside (impervious to lock picks).</p>\n<p>Inside, the apartment has three rooms &mdash; a bedroom</p>\n<p>for the two brothers to share, a living room where they take their meals on a rickety table and chairs, and a saferoom where they stash all their stolen goods. Currently in the safe-room is a sack of stolen coinage &mdash; 10d10 brass pennies, and 5d10 silver shillings &mdash; as well as 12 and a half pairs of stolen boots, 2 crates of stolen grog, and a box full of stolen medicines and poultices from an apothecary.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day the Characters may recall hearing Srulem yelling at the door to the penthouse. However, now Srulem is nowhere to be found. If the Characters knock on the door, they will be confronted by Sreluc and his loaded blunderbuss, who at first accuses the Characters of being agents of the Ubersreik Dwarfs.

However, he will give his oath that the medicine will be handed over if the Characters help him find Srulem. Luckily, Srulem isn&rsquo;t far off. A few minutes of searching the empty rooms on the 4th floor will turn up his unconscious form.

Srulem seems weak and dizzy, but not ill.</p>\n<p>Upon seeing the state of his brother, Sreluc will honour his oath but will fly into a rage and begin battering down the door to Eluharath&rsquo;s apartment, shouting:<em> &lsquo;I dinnae believe him, but he was right!

He attends some of the more cultural Carnival events, but is attended by an escort of half a dozen Teutogen Guards: elite warriors of Ulric drawn from within the Knights of the White Wolf. While the Guards are worried about possible threats to Ar-Ulric from fanatical followers of Sigmar or agents of a treacherous Emperor, the high priest himself is reduced to an almost paranoid state by the threat of blackmail that hangs over him, and the Graf ’s paramour, @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emannuelle Schlagen}. He is suspicious, if not downright terrified, of any stranger who approaches him in public. He is heavily guarded in private.</p>\n<p>While it is possible to engineer a situation in which the Characters can rescue Ar-Ulric from some threat, the Characters are more likely to find themselves flung out of the way by his bodyguard, who handles the situation with brutal efficiency. Any Characters who resist being flung aside find themselves treated as additional threats rather than helpful members of the public.</p>\n<p>The best, and perhaps the only, way to meet with Ar-Ulric on favourable terms is to be introduced by someone he trusts, preferably with a recommendation from @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle}. While the two cannot be too public in their meetings, she can still give the Characters a token which Ar-Ulric recognises, and that reassures him that she trusts the party. Preoccupied as he is with the threat of blackmail, he must be reassured that the Characters can help with this —or, better still, have already neutralised the blackmailer — before he can give his full attention to any stories of plots against the city or threats to the Graf ’s life.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Ar-Ulric can provide relatively few introductions, and will have to trust the Characters implicitly before he does so.

{"_id":"9JfYud9wQYoo8J4d","name":"Humans (Reiklander)","content":"<p>Humans are the most numerous and widespread of the civilised species of the Old World. From the plains of the Estalian Kingdoms to the frozen oblasts of Imperial Kislev, Humans occupy every corner of the continent, and they thrive. The largest, most powerful Human realm is the Empire, a patchwork of powerful provinces blanketed in seemingly endless forests. Standing proud at the heart of this Empire, the Reikland is its richest, most cosmopolitan region.</p>\n<p>Many Reiklanders see it as their divine right to rule, for the patron god of the Empire, Sigmar, was himself a Reiklander before he ascended to godhood many centuries ago. Temples and shrines to the god are found everywhere, and the majority of Reiklanders are devout believers in Sigmar’s message of Empire and unity. Because of this, they are significantly more friendly, open, and optimistic than other folk, since what could possibly go wrong for a land that birthed a god? By comparison, outsiders often see them as arrogant, over-bearing meddlers who stick their unwanted noses into any affair.</p>\n<p>Beyond their affluent lifestyles and pushy personalities, Reiklanders are largely the same as other Humans. They may be shorter-lived than other species, but Humans possess more vigour, versatility, and ambition. They also have a seemingly inextricable relationship with the insidious horrors of the Ruinous Powers, with more Humans falling to corruption than any other </p>\n<p>species. Perhaps it’s no surprise the declining elder species grow increasingly concerned the meteoric rise of Humanity could result in cataclysm. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Opinions</h3>\n<h4>On Dwarfs…</h4>\n<p><em>‘They’ve been our allies since Sigmar walked this very city; fought with them meself back in ’05.

A young Ubersreik wine merchant, Stefan Maranaeur, began an affair with Henri-Phillippe’s wife, Elisabet. Unfortunately, Henri-Phillippe learned of their relationship, having chanced upon a love letter (from Stefan) to his wife. If he had been able to act immediately things would have come to a head, as Henri-Phillippe confronted his wife in a typical Bretonnian rage. As it was, Elisabet was away in Ubersreik, presumably with her lover, giving Henri-Phillippe’s burning rage time to turn to ice and fill his thoughts with revenge.</p>\n<p>A month later, Henri-Phillippe sent his wife to Ubersreik with money to purchase new clothes. Elisabet readily agreed, seeing a further opportunity to meet her lover. But Henri-Phillippe had other plans for Stefan, and had simultaneously invited him to Maubast, without Elisabet’s knowledge, ostensibly to taste a new wine. Stefan duly arrived, and a day spent discussing business ended with one of Henri-Philippe’s famous wine tastings, to which the rest of the village was also invited.</p>\n<p>As part of the evening’s conversation Stefan learned that Elisabet had gone to Ubersreik. Cursing his luck, Stefan moderated his drinking in anticipation of an early start, commenting that he <em>“must return next morning and attend to important business.”</em> That night, however, Henri-Phillippe attacked Stefan as he slept, clubbing him senseless. Rocheteau dragged the body down to the cellar where a special alcove had been prepared. Having chained Stefan to the wall, Henri-Philippe waited until the young wine merchant recovered. With care and precision Henri-Philippe then began to seal the alcove with stone and mortar, oblivious to the desperate pleas from Stefan.</p>\n<p>Finally the work was completed, leaving Henri-Philippe satisfied. He had left a barrel of wine within reach to ease Stefan’s thirst, planning that Stefan would experience a slow death from starvation. All that remained was to dispose of Stefan’s horse. With the village still sleeping off the effects of the wine, Henri-Philippe had no trouble slipping out unnoticed. Scattering Stefan’s belongings by the road he let the horse loose and returned to Maubast.</p>\n<p>Three days later, Stefan’s saddle and pack were spotted. Everyone had assumed he had left early without waiting to say farewell. Despite a search organised by the Mayor of Maubast, his body was never found.</p>\n<p>For a while the disappearance, and presumed death, of the young wine merchant caused much talk and anxiety in the area. However, with no further incidents to fuel speculation, the name of Stefan Maranaeur was forgotten, or at least that’s what Henri-Philippe hoped and thought. And so things might have been, save for one person: Stefan’s twin brother, Dieter.</p>\n<p>At the time of Stefan’s imprisonment, Dieter Maranaeur was nearing the end of a successful wizard’s apprenticeship at Altdorf. Yet, as the days of Stefan’s ordeal passed, his brother began to suffer in much the same way. Linked by kinship, Dieter at first suffered sleepless nights but within a week showed signs of a severe wasting disease. Soon after, the apprentice wizard collapsed into delirium, and as his condition worsened the physicians feared for his life. Suddenly (i.e., at the moment of Stefan’s death), the month-long illness vanished and Dieter began to recover. Only then was he told of his brother’s disappearance while on a business trip to Maubast.</p>\n<p>In the three years that have passed, Dieter has learned of his late brother’s affair with Elisabet (from letters he found at Stefan’s Ubersreik residence) and the invitation from Henri-Philippe. Discussing these matters, along with the mysterious illness, with his superiors, Dieter has finally managed to piece together the nature of his brother’s demise.</p>\n<p>Dieter, now a master wizard of the Bright Order, has come to the village consumed by the idea of revenge. Driven by his own (slightly irrational) beliefs, Dieter is also affected by the spirit of his dead brother; Stefan Maranaeur now exerts a hateful force from beyond the grave and Dieter is being influenced to ruin Maubast and kill Rocheteau.</p>\n<p>The wizard’s first move was to scout the local country and find a safe base for himself and his hired bodyguard, Kurt Schultz. This is when he got lucky, after a fashion. In a cave well-hidden by vegetation they discovered numerous human and humanoid skulls, grim remnants of an ancient battle. Dieter at once sensed that they were magical in some way. After experimentation, Dieter learned that they could be controlled, to some extent at least. Since then he has been unleashing them to attack the village of Maubast; they are a perfect way of terrifying the villagers and forcing them to abandon the place. What Dieter doesn’t know is that the magical qualities of the skulls are due to trace elements of warpstone present in the cave. What neither Dieter nor the residents of the village know is that there is already a group of adventurers investigating the disturbance—a group that is likely to think that the PCs are in league with the wizard!</p>\n<p>The remainder of the adventure is set out as follows. After setting the initial scene as the PCs arrive in the village, there is a section on NPCs in Maubast: what they do, who they are, what they know and suggestions on how they will respond to various PC actions and conversation. This is followed by descriptions of Dieter, Kurt, and their cave; details of the other adventurers’ camp are also given. An important aspect to the adventure concerns time: Dieter will effectively win if the grape harvest is prevented. The atmosphere in the village will become increasingly desperate as the days pass.</p>","folder":"jsAKzmzu9XIh3Q9e","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

He may or may not recognise the Characters immediately, but as soon as he does so, he tries to get away. As the song says, a gambler knows when to run, and based on his last experience with the party, he expects that they will either attack him on sight or expose him for cheating, neither of which bodes well for his prospects.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some time has passed and many adventures have befallen the party since they last crossed paths with the gambler, so there is a chance that they might not recognise him straight away. The GM might decide to impose <strong>Average (+20) Intelligence</strong> Tests on all Characters when they first see the Bretonnian: on a Marginal success he seems familiar but they cannot place him, and on a better success they remember the incident in the <em>Coach and Horses</em>. Meanwhile, Phillipe, with a hard-earned ability to remember everyone who might present a threat, has recognised them right away and does his best to avoid them, fleeing if necessary and fighting if cornered. He might even try to set the party up in some way, so that they are detained by the local road wardens or the Watch while he catches the next coach out.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE HIGH CARD</em></h3>\n<p><em>On the other hand, Phillipe knows that luck can change any time a new hand is dealt, and that old enemies might become new friends should a mutual need arise.</em></p>\n<p><em>During Carnival Week while the commoner's inns are packed and any number of low stakes games are played, the best gamblers in the Empire meet for a game of cards where fortunes are made and lost on a single hand.

First, the grass is cut, the bushes are trimmed, and all is made perfect in the garden itself. Then, the Graf ’s pavilion, the stage, and other structures are erected. Staging areas for food and drink are set up, chairs and other furniture are brought out, and last of all, deliveries of flowers, perishable food, and other last-minute necessities arrive.</p>\n<p>At noon, @Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal} the chamberlain stalks out of the palace, casting a critical eye over the preparations and making sure that all is perfect. Knights Panther take up their guard stations; servants, groundskeepers, and other staff hustle out. </p>\n<p>At 1:30 p.m. the performers are permitted into the garden, shown where they can and cannot go, and allowed time to tune their instruments or make other preparations.</p>\n<p>Guests begin to arrive at the palace from 10:00 a.m., eager to be the first to meet the city’s ruler. Once their invitations have been checked they are held in an outer courtyard, where musicians play and liveried servants distribute refreshments. By 2:00 p.m., the courtyard is a heaving mass of people.</p>\n<h3>2:00–4:00 P.M.</h3>\n<p>Precisely at 2:00 p.m., a trumpet fanfare announces the opening of the garden party. @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} makes his way from the palace to his pavilion, escorted by a dozen Knights Panther. As he enters his pavilion his electoral flag is raised to indicate his presence. Breugal takes up his station by the Graf ’s right shoulder, and indicates with a nod that guests may enter.</p>\n<p>For the next two hours or so, the guests file past the Graf ’s pavilion, offering a bow or curtsey and receiving a distracted nod of acknowledgement. The few who try to speak to the Graf are quickly seen off by @Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal}. </p>\n<p>Among the first arrivals are several prominent members of the city’s Dwarf community — with typical Dwarven precision, they take the start time on their invitations literally, and would never think of being late. They bow formally to the Graf, but with a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test, any Character can tell that beneath their impassive faces and impressive beards they are deeply unhappy. A Dwarf Character does not require a Test to see this. Prominent among them is an old Dwarf with a fine, long white beard and a terrible squint. This is Convenor Yarnad Magradil, who manages the Dwarf office of the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission for Dwarf, Elf, and Halfling Interests}.</p>\n<p><strong>2:10 -</strong> Bettie Greenhill, the ebullient and industrious Halfling who manages the Graf ’s Kitchens, starts to lay out platters of food on trestle tables near the hedge maze. She fetches a hutch of rabbits around 3:30 and places them near the hedge maze to help keep younger garden party guests amused.</p>\n<h3>4:00–5:00 P.M.</h3>\n<p>As the early arrivals thin out, more prominent members of Middenheim’s court begin to arrive.</p>\n<p><strong>4:00 -</strong> A cheery group led by @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} comes in from the Square of Martials, where the archery tournament has just finished. If the Characters have managed to befriend the court minstrel, they may be with him as his guests. @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} accompanies the group, talking eagerly about the events of the tournament to anyone who makes eye contact.</p>\n<p><strong>4:05 -</strong> Meanwhile, Rallane and his friends greet the Graf, and Rallane mounts the stage to give an impromptu performance on the lute. A crowd gathers round to hear him play, while the Dwarf delegation stands to one side, glaring at the Elf whom many blame for the introduction of the Dwarf Tax. Yarnad Magradril makes a comment before Rallane’s second tune<em>. ‘Sweet enough for warbling I suppose, but if the Chancellor taxed you by the note he’d fill his coffers without having to bother them that does proper work’.  </em></p>\n<p>There is an awkward silence, and if a Character thinks of something suitably mollifying to say, they may well earn some gratitude from all in attendance (alternatively if they exacerbate matters, they earn people’s disapproval). Rallane plays for about fifteen minutes before leaving the stage to stroll about the party, chatting with friends, visiting the other entertainers, and playing from time to time.</p>\n<p><strong>4:15 -</strong> @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} emerges from the palace, in the company of a pudgy man in his fifties. Richly dressed in Marienburger fashion, her companion seems both fascinated by her company and determined to talk her ear off. She smiles politely and puts in a word or phrase where she can, but her increasing annoyance is clear to anyone who makes an <strong>Easy (+40) Intuition</strong> Test. Characters who have previously made her acquaintance may try to rescue her from her tedious guest, gaining her gratitude if they do so without causing an incident. The man is Thijs van Zalijvwijre, a high-ranking member of Marienburg’s Goods Exchange, and his goodwill ensures that Middenheim’s merchants trade on favourable terms in the great port-city.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} arrives a few moments later, laughing loudly and staggering a little as he leans on two giggling young women who are clearly not dressed for a garden party: a successful <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test leads a Character to the conclusion that they are barmaids from the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales} in @JournalEntry[UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{the Great Park}. @Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal} intercepts the group as it weaves its way towards the Graf, stopping Pavarotti with a palm on his chest and a few quiet words. </p>\n<p>The Tilean’s face darkens momentarily, then he turns around with a good-natured shrug, escorting his two supporters back out of the palace and leaving each with a kiss. They head happily back to their duties at the @JournalEntry[UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{Great Park}, talking about having seen the palace, while @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} totters back to the party, bowing deeply to the Graf and biting his thumb at @Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal}as he straightens up (characters familiar with Tilean culture recognise this as a highly impertinent gesture).</p>\n<p>Baroness Marlena Klochmann from Hochland arrives. She is a distinguished lady with stiff movements who looks old before her time, with pale skin, grey hair and bright green eyes. </p>\n<p>This is an alias of @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich}. She mingles, giving nothing away. Her time here is spent listening in to others’ conversations and gauging how well her plans are progressing. If the characters are indiscreet about their investigations she may well overhear them.</p>\n<p><strong>4:30 -</strong> High Priest Werner Stolz of the @JournalEntry[vAaGf9u5fHrlxSSs]{Temple of Sigmar} arrives, accompanied by a couple of initiates. A group of visiting merchants from Altdorf gravitates toward him, discussing the current religious tensions and asking him about recent rumours of anti-Sigmarite atrocities in Middenheim and across Middenland. He answers as best he can, but seems uncomfortable. As the conversation goes on, nearby partygoers quietly move away, leaving the Sigmarites alone and clearly isolated from the rest of the crowd. It is a subtle gesture, but definite, and Characters who pay attention notice that neither the priests nor the merchants have much to do with the other guests for the rest of the party. The Characters can join in the conversation if they wish; fellow Reiklanders are welcomed into the group, at the cost of being increasingly shunned by the surrounding Middenheimers. They can pass along any rumours or facts about the religious situation, and the growing north-south divide in general.</p>\n<p><strong>4:45 -</strong> @Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen}, High Matriarch of the cult of Shallya in Middenheim, arrives. She looks concerned by the sight of the Graf and speaks to him softly for a while before Breugal ushers her on. She mingles with other guests.</p>\n<p>At this time @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} and Thijs van Zalijvwijre wander about in the hedge maze.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/handout-menu.webp\" width=\"443\" height=\"645\" /></div>\n<h3>5:00–6:00 P.M.</h3>\n<p><strong>5:00 - </strong>@Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Marshal von Genscher} arrives, bowing to the Graf and saluting the Knights Panther who flank his pavilion; they respond by snapping to attention. Von Genscher pauses briefly, scanning the crowd as if looking for someone, and then turns and hurries away into the crowd. Seconds later, @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} struggles through the crowd in pursuit of him, giving up after a few dozen paces.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi} and @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane}, who have both wanted to get to know one another a little better, take a stroll through the hedge maze.</p>\n<p><strong>5:10 -</strong> High Wizard @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Holseher} arrives, accompanied by his deputy @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} and her sister @Actor[ThOmnHA3l1Slh78K]{Erina}. All three are in the formal robes of their respective orders. Holseher bows stiffly to the Graf, who barely acknowledges him; he steps forward and opens his mouth to speak, but is stopped by a look from Breugal. Janna, meanwhile, scans the crowd. She sees Petra appearing from the hedge maze and gives her a friendly wave. Helseher wanders off and leaves them, as Janna points out major NPCs to her sister. If the Characters have already made Erina’s acquaintance at the @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{Templar’s Arms}, this is their opportunity to be introduced to Janna. Her reaction to them is modified by the impression they have already made on her sister.</p>\n<p><strong>5:15 -</strong> @Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich} arrives accompanying Sergei Bukharin, ambassador to the Empire from Tsar Radii Bokha of Kislev. He wears his hair and moustaches in long braids threaded with ceramic beads and he radiates strength. Despite the splendour all around, he can hardly take his eyes off Natasha, who reminds him of an old lover. She smiles and responds with seeming affection, but a <strong>Hard (–20) Intuition</strong> Test leads any Character to conclude that her manner is feigned. </p>\n<p>Those close enough to overhear gather that they have just come from the @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur fights} at the @JournalEntry[eM2ZiVNgS7dzI2bA]{Bernabau Stadium}, and the visitor is part of a Kislevite diplomatic mission that arrived shortly before Carnival week began.</p>\n<p><strong>5:20 -</strong> @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} arrives and bows to the Graf, treating him to an oily and ingratiating smile. The Graf nods without even looking up, and Gotthard stifles a scowl as he turns on his heel, snatches a drink from a passing tray, and stalks off into the crowd.</p>\n<p>Convenor Yarnad Magradil spots Gotthard and wades through the crowd toward him with grim determination. The Dwarf tries to corner Gotthard on the subject of the new taxes. Gotthard makes excuses about none of them being his idea (unconvincing, for the chair of the @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission on Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, but true nonetheless) and tries to persuade Yarnad to take the matter up with the Law Lords. If the Characters are interested in making Gotthard’s acquaintance (whether or not they already know that he is actually Gotthard von Wittgenstein), this is an opportunity for them to step in and smooth things over. </p>\n<p>This is not easy, though, as Yarnad is outraged and insulted and knows that his community is looking to him to take action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>5:30 -</strong> A cheer goes up from the entrance to the garden as @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} arrives, lofting the archery trophy in triumph — or, if he has failed to maintain his winning streak, carrying the victor on his shoulders. If one of the Characters won the tournament, the whole party is with the huntmaster as his guests. Anyone close to @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} who passes a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test notices her look over to the source of the cheer, like most other guests, and then turns away quickly, with a slight blush on her cheeks. Meanwhile, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel} and @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} greet each other with a wave and a shout in Elthárin, gesturing to a nearby drinks table where they and their companions meet up with much cheering and back-slapping.</p>\n<p><strong>5:45 - </strong>@Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich} and Sergei Bukharin take their turn to find their way through the hedge maze.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi} is not a wholly malign man, but when bored he does indulge in an appetite for high jinks. Having found the punch rather tame, he doctors it with extract of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.b6tGqvNe1jYBdeN5]{Weirdroot}. Anyone drinking a glass from this point forward should make an <strong>Average (+20) Toughness</strong> Test, or suffer the effects of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.b6tGqvNe1jYBdeN5]{Weirdroot}. Characters passing a <strong>Very Hard (–30) Perception</strong> Test spot the Doktor producing a small vial and preparing to empty it into the punch bowl. They could let him know they have their eye on him, in which case their discretion wins them his friendship. Alternatively, they could inform the authorities. This would end the Physician’s career in Middenheim, but wins the Characters the high regard of @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Chaperone Zimperlich}. If Bettie Greenhill is informed she provides a fresh bowl of punch, and can scold Luigi without costing him his position at court.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>6:00–7:00 P.M.</h3>\n<p><strong>6:00 - </strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} arrive together, with her two sisters Ulrike and Bertha. The sisters may have shared a coach with the Characters on the journey from Altdorf (as well as the early part of the adventure @JournalEntry[u0jibG3CVNoLK6GT]{Flying Death Skulls}, and this is an opportunity to renew the acquaintance and possibly to be introduced to Kirsten and Dieter as gallant travelling companions. Depending on the events of the journey, the Characters can gain an initial bonus to Fellowship Tests when dealing with Dieter and Kirsten, up to a maximum of +30. Those who did not endear themselves to the sisters are not granted an introduction: their subsequent dealings with Dieter or Kirsten suffer a penalty of up to –20, and if they persist in bothering the group, Dieter sees them off.</p>\n<p>A scuffle breaks out between children at the rabbit hutch, and a pair of rabbits escape and hop into the hedge maze.</p>\n<p><strong>6:10 -</strong> The rather infirm Baroness Marlena Klochmann presses on @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} to help her find her way through the hedge maze. Siegfried condescends to help the Baroness. Anyone who passes a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test notices that he is more relieved at the invitation than she is by his agreeing to it, after all no one else was paying him any attention.</p>\n<p><strong>6:15 -</strong> Another flourish of trumpets announces the arrival of @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’ Katarina}, who comes out of the palace accompanied by her chaperone @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} and lady at court @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}. The little group curtseys to the Graf, who looks up and smiles wanly. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test allows a Character to notice the pride in his eyes as he looks at his daughter, and a hint of something else — perhaps an attempt to rally himself ? — when he acknowledges Emmanuelle.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE WINE OF MADNESS</em></h3>\n<p><em>If you intend to make use of the short adventure '@JournalEntry[eZNUTrVGtnRXtKUx]{The Wine of Madness}', you may wish to lay the groundwork for that adventure now. @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard} has taken a little of the Estalian Mosca with him to sample at the garden party, or perhaps to taint the drinks or food that can be had there. Characters who pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test will spot Wallenstein drop a small glass bottle from inside his waistcoat at around 5:45 pm, before quickly recovering it and glancing about to see if anyone noticed him. There are too many present for him to spot the Characters unless they draw attention to themselves. Those who passed the Perception Test by at least +2 SL notice that @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}, fresh from his own much milder enhancement of the punch, got a good look at the bottle Gottard dropped and seems quite amused...</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Almost as soon as the ‘princess’ turns away from her father, a tidal wave of handsome young gallants surrounds the three women. Hildegarde and Emmanuelle stand by Katarina’s side, doing their best to deflect as many as they can, but Katarina herself hardly seems to notice. She politely offers distant responses to the deluge of compliments and attempts to grab her attention.</p>\n<p><strong>6:20 - </strong>Bettie Greenhill enters the hedge maze to search for the stray rabbits.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>6:30 - </strong>After making a circuit of the party, High Wizard @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher} returns to the Graf ’s pavilion. Anyone passing a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test sees him start to say something before Breugal steps forward and raises a warning hand. Shooting a venomous glance at @Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal}, he bows and takes his leave. He had tried to talk to the Graf about the taxes, but the chamberlain did not want his master bothered.</p>\n<p>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} is working up the nerve to talk to @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}. Anyone passing a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test notices her watching him intently for a while. She does not approve of his wild manner of carousing. After a while she approaches him. He immediately settles down, and stands respectfully. She then thanks him effusively for the generous donations he has made to the Shallyan institutions in Middenheim. He smiles an unctuous smile and tells her that it was his most humble pleasure.</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} emerges from the hedge maze. Spotting the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’} he rather ungraciously leaves Baroness Marlene and joins the throng of young men surrounding Katarina. He is roundly ignored by everyone, and after a while he leaves to mingle once more. He spots @Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{von Genscher} eating a pastry nearby, and starts toward him with a hopeful expression; the Marshal, however, spots Siegfried from the corner of his eye and moves quickly away, striking up a conversation with Sergei Bukharin about the logistics of supplying a field army in the cold boreal forests of the Troll Country. Anyone passing an <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test notices Siegfried grimace and shrink visibly. He shuffles dejectedly to the pavilion, bows to the Graf and takes his leave.</p>\n<p><strong>6:40 - </strong>Having mingled for a while, @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten}, Ulrike, and Bertha sit down with @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} and @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel} and share a few drinks.</p>\n<p><strong>6:45 - </strong>Having made their introductions, Bertha and Ulrike navigate the hedge maze, during which they encounter Bettie Greenhill still looking for the rabbits.</p>\n<p>Shortly before 7:00, guests begin to drift away, heading for the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music} and the opera <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessile}</em>. These include @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}, surrounded by a boisterous group of friends, and @Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Marshal von Genscher}, walking purposefully but alone. Baroness Marlena Klochmann, who knows not to push her luck, also vanishes at this point.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>7:00–8:00 P.M.</h3>\n<p><strong>7:00 - </strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} arrives with a small party of three priests and two Knights of the White Wolf. He bows to the Graf; the White Wolves suppress scowls at the scant nod he receives in return. Ar-Ulric speaks briefly to his companions; the priests nod and head off toward a nearby drinks table, but the White Wolves shake their heads. After holding their impassive gaze for a few seconds, Ar-Ulric snorts in frustration and heads off into the crowd, the two knights matching his stride.</p>\n<p>Characters close to @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} may make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test to notice that she and Ar-Ulric exchange a glance. It is clearly meaningful, but hard to interpret: an Impressive or better success will lead to the conclusion that they are romantically involved, and hoped to meet at the party before the High Priest’s bodyguard thwarted them.</p>\n<p>@Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} and @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} take a wander through the hedge maze.</p>\n<p>Bettie Greenhill leaves the hedge maze having captured the errant rabbits.</p>\n<p><strong>7:15 -</strong> @Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} has spotted @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}.

The name is taken from the three districts you have to pass through on journeying over it; one collected for Flottenliegeplatz, one for Niederhafen Bezirk and one for Altsalem Bezirk. The latter of these is a small district that covers Altsalem Island, which juts out of the river like some colossal basalt shark&rsquo;s fin, supporting the centre of the bridge.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Sigmar Bridge, which uses gigantic steam engines to raise and allow ships to pass, Three Toll Bridge is a fixed structure, and therefore towers over the city so that the masts of ships can safely pass below it.</p>\n<p>Businesses built upon the bridge fall into the jurisdiction of the Altsalem Bezirk, notorious city wide for the negligible rate of tax imposed. The Bezirk is run under the corrupt regime of Klaus von Tsch&uuml;tscher, an important local noble who sits on many of Altdorf&rsquo;s many Kommision Councils, whose opulent town-house just happens to be located in the centre of Three Tolls Bridge itself.</p>\n<p>The Bridge is always busy, with wagons and carts constantly flowing across it. Additionally, Beggars, street artists, guttersnipes and costermongers line the sides of the bridge &ndash; all trying to attract a few clanks from the passing populace. Between them agitators and raconteurs stand on upturned barrels or soap boxes, preaching their messages to all who will listen, at least until von Tsch&uuml;tscher House Guard get around to moving them on for vagrancy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Yvette B&ouml;ttcher &ndash; Badge Seller</h3>\n<p>The somewhat confused girlfriend of a Journeyman Light Mage, Yvette B&ouml;ttcher sells small copper badges endorsing the end to the policy of celibacy within the Colleges of Magic. While this is not one of the most populist movements in Altdorf, one of the main planks of her argument is telling bawdy tales that expose the hypocrisy of Magisters on this matter, which always gathers a fair crowd.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;It is so unfair I tell you! If Magister G&uuml;nter Hunold can attend the parties of Michaela von J&auml;nke and engage in unrestrained debauchery, then why cannot my Magnus spend a night with me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Luther Huss is in Altdorf and is to preach upon the subject of Valten&rsquo;s Heroism at the Mallusschmied Palais tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Johan Kyttlie &ndash; Weather Scryer</h3>\n<p>Johan makes his living selling weather forecasts to ship&rsquo;s captains and anyone else who wants one. To do this he employs many traditional Reikland techniques, almost all of which require string, dried fish and a limited ability to call on the Winds of Magic. If questioned, he will stress at length that he is not in fact a Hedge Wizard, and that all of his divination methods are done with science, not magic at all. In common with other Altdorf Weather Scryers, Johan wears tattered robes covered with divination trinkets and carries a copper shod staff with seabird feathers pinned to it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Something is not right, the weather has been wrong for the last two weeks and that incident with the burning barge just made it worse.

He owns a small flat in the Schlafstadt district, from which he undertakes many a nightly foray into the Three Toll Bridge in search of wine, weirdroot and political opinion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Michaela von J&auml;nke is somewhat of an expert on legal liberties. She is also said to hold some of the most exquisite parties in Altdorf.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A few weeks back the watch took hold of Andreas Gesetz the Cartographer, saying his maps were so contradictory he must have been taking Notropian Blue. It turns out though he was using a licensed supplier, so the case got dismissed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The problem is this city just does not value the written word! You can burn the works of Leonardo and suffer no more than a penny fine for destroying the parchment!&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Joey Proudhun &ndash; Halfling Agitator</h3>\n<p>A little man with big ideas, Joey came to the capitol of the Empire demanding reform of the outdated political system in favour of a thinking man&rsquo;s representative council based on the shire system of the moot. As a Halfling, Joey has been refused membership of every radical group he has sought to join, which he puts down to just another example of the outmoded &lsquo;bigist&rsquo; ideas of the supposedly civilised humans. Each day Joey preaches from a barrel top about political reform, handing out leaflets and quoting passages from &lsquo;the Blood of Innocents&rsquo; when the watch are not looking.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The Van Damneg Print-works does good rates per sheet, which is why they get so much custom.

{"_id":"AIC5DctuB8hxIBst","name":"Prayers","content":"<p>A small number of the faithful stand apart from their peers, seemingly able to appeal for their deity’s direct intervention in the form of miracles. Those who perform such feats are known by many names in different parts of the Old World — including: Living Saints, Gods’ Servants, The Hallowed, Divine Wills, Anointed Ones — but, in the Empire, they are most commonly referred to as ‘Blessed’, which is often used as a title. So, if Sister Anna where to be Blessed by Sigmar — i.e. granted Sigmar’s grace, able to have her prayers answered — she would become ‘Blessed Anna’, or, in full, ‘Blessed Anna, Sister of Sigmar’.</p>\n<h3>The Blessed</h3>\n<p>There are two Talents that specifically mark out those Blessed by the gods: @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.QyjWtSdnVMT04l5Y]{Bless} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.voV0C2ar1bKpcpnH]{Invoke}. Characters with the Bless Talent may enact Blessings, which are minor manifestations of divine will, while the Invoke Talent allows the Blessed to call on their gods for more powerful Miracles.</p>\n<h4>Blessings and Miracles</h4>\n<p>Blessing and Miracles are prayers spoken by one of the Blessed, and then empowered by a god. To enact a Blessing or Miracle, make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Pray </strong>Test. If you score a Success, your Blessing or Miracle manifests according to its rules, and a high SL will give you bonus effects. If you score a Failure, your words are spoken, but your god, for whatever reason, refuses to listen. If you Fumble the Pray Test, you have offended your god and must roll on the Wrath of the Gods table.</p>\n<h4>Limitations</h4>\n<p>You must be able to speak to intone the required prayer, rite, chant, or song to enact a Blessing or Miracle. Each of your Blessings or Miracles can only be in effect once, meaning you have to wait for an existing one to come to an end before using the same prayer again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Multiple invocations of the same prayer by different individuals do not offer cumulative bonuses. Thus, intoning two Blessings of Finesse will only provide a bonus of +10 to Dexterity.</p>\n<h3>Sin Points</h3>\n<p>The Blessed are watched closely by the gods, and risk gaining the disfavour of their deities if they should act contrary to their gods’ will. In game, this is represented with Sin points.</p>\n<p>If you violate any of the Cult Strictures listed under your god, the GM will award one or more Sin Points. Every time you receive a Sin point, it is added it to your running total. There is no maximum to the number of Sin points you can earn. The more points you have, the more upset your god is likely to be should you call upon divine aid.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>It's a Sin!</em></h3>\n<p><em>There are many different ways Blessed Priests can break their strictures; GMs should consider the scale of the infraction when awarding Sin Points, and allocate them proportionately, normally scoring 1 to 3. For instance, one of the strictures of the cult of Myrmidia is to respect prisoners of war. If a Myrmidian priest were to deny a thirsty prisoner of war a drink of water, this may earn a single Sin point. Beating a prisoner would be a great infraction, securing maybe 2 Sin points. Torturing or killing a helpless prisoner is unacceptable to Myrmidia, easily earning 3 or maybe more Sin points.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Kind GMs may wish to warn players before they commit infractions, especially if they are new to WFRP.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Sin and Wrath</h4>\n<p>Appealing to your deity when you have been acting contrary to the god’s wishes is risky. Whenever you make a Pray Test, if the units die of the result is equal to or less than your current Sin point total, then you will suffer the Wrath of the Gods, even if the Pray Test is successful.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Preach It, Sister!</em></h3>\n<p><em>Each of the gods have different styles of prayers, designed to be intoned in different ways. Whether these are the warcries of Ulric, the shanties of Manaan, or the threnodies of Morr, each requires the words be spoken (or sung) firmly, and with conviction.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>To represent this, the GM may require that any Pray Tests that are intoned quietly or without confidence have a higher Difficulty.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><em>You've Got To Pray!</em></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">If a character behaves in a particularly pious manner, such as completing an arduous pilgrimage, or making a significant donation to their cult, the GM may wish to remove one or more Sin Points with a successful Pray Test, used to show you are begging for absolution. This, of course, also risks the chance of Wrath of the Gods. Otherwise, the only way to remove Sin Points is by rolling on the Wrath of the Gods table.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Wrath Of The Gods</h3>\n<p>The Wrath of Gods table is referenced whenever you Fumble a Pray Test, or when the units die of a Pray Test is equal or lower than your current Sin points. The GM may also use it, or pluck results from it, whenever you foolishly insult any of the gods. When rolling on the @Table[wrath], add +10 to the roll for each Sin Point you have accrued. After rolling and applying the result, reduce your Sin points by 1, to a minimum of 0.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong>You can add a modifier to a table by right clicking the table link</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Penance</h4>\n<p>Some Wrath of the Gods results require penance. The GM can decide upon a suitable penance depending on your misdeed, or they may prefer you to choose your own penance, with further punishment awaiting if you are insufficiently penitent. Examples of typical penances are listed in each cult description. Penances may come in the form of a vision, divine inspiration or, very rarely, by direct communication from your deity. If you are not worthy of such contact, a penance may be conveyed through another member of your cult. Alternatively, a Divine Servant of the cult could manifest — this could be a dead teacher, a figure of legend, or an appropriate animal — and inform you what is required. The GM should consider the sins involved, and how the god in question would likely react to these.</p>","folder":"NkiXlTQtgNkW3FMs","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"}}}

{"_id":"AK5GN83vbZLaX6V0","name":"Lesser Temples","content":"<p>No matter where Ulric’s temples are erected, almost all follow the same template: a square wall protecting a fortified inner sanctum. The outer walls are normally undecorated, although isolated temples proudly boast any scars of war they have sustained. A single, reinforced gatehouse pierces the defences, and often houses an array of anti-siege measures. A wolf ’s head emblem is carved above the gate: the only sign that the place is a temple and not a well-defended keep.</p>\n<p>Within, everything is austere, utilitarian, and grey. Functional temple buildings (including workshops, cells, barracks, refectories, stables, and animal pens) cling close to the high walls, overlooking wide courtyards and training squares. The temple itself rises in the centre, its manned battlements surrounding a high dome.</p>\n<p>The temple interior is usually a single, windowless chamber, lit only by small apertures in the dome above and by a great, central, ever-burning fire that represents the Eternal Flame in Middenheim. Opposite the entrance, and behind the sacred flame, is a raised sacristy. Here, a grim statue of Ulric, sometimes sitting, often flanked by wolves, silently challenges those who dare enter his sacred hall.</p>\n<h3>The Womb of The Wolf</h3>\n<p>The Womb of the Wolf is believed by the Sons to be the site where Ulric’s first mortal child was born. The mother, Griselda, was the daughter of the Teutogen chief, and fled into the tunnels of the Ulricsberg when she became pregnant. There, the Sons believe, she was brought meat by Ulric’s wolves, and drank water from a holy spring.</p>\n<p>There is still a spring there today, and the site where the birth supposedly happened is lined with wolf skins. See @JournalEntry[izJWeN4ivjqEleqK]{Womb of the Wolf} for more information.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[LsUklap1rbMtM7RO]{The Place of Shining Rock}</h3>\n<p>On the road from Altdorf to Middenheim, about fifty miles from the City of the White Wolf, there is a remote shrine known as the Place of Shining Rock.</p>\n<p>Unusually, it is sacred to both Ulric and Sigmar. It is said to be the site of a pleasant, wooded glade where one of the two gods (depending on the faith of whomever is telling the story) had come to rest after a battle against the forces of Chaos. Caught in an ambush with his weapon out of reach (or temporarily lost, according to some versions of the legend), the god picked up a strange rock as an improvised shield. An attacker’s blow miraculously shattered part of it into a long, sharp shard and, using it as a sword, the god slew five hundred enemies before they fled. A shrine was built around the rock, which lays where the god threw it down after the battle.</p>\n<p>The turning off the road to the shrine is marked by a large, white boulder. Half a mile down the track is an open area of flat, rocky ground, an acre or two in extent. In the middle stands a simple but elegant building about 40 feet long, with a low tower at one end. It looks more like a village temple than a shrine. At the edge of the clearing, by the river that marks one side of it and about 70 yards from the shrine itself, is another building: a single-storey wood-framed structure with a steep planked roof and a chimney. This one-room structure houses the four priests — two of Sigmar and two of Ulric — who attend the shrine.</p>\n<h3>The Shrine of the Wolf</h3>\n<p>On a country road ten miles north of Altdorf lies an obscure shrine: a small stone tower, not more than 10 feet square and four storeys high. It tapers as it rises, and ends in a tiled belfry. The bell is gone, however, and hasn’t been there for hundreds of years. On the ground floor is a wooden altar supporting a small, wooden statue of a wolf, and carved into the wall behind it is the simple legend: Sigmar and Ulric.</p>\n<p>According to local legends, the place commemorates the site where Sigmar was said to have met with Ulric in his wolven form. He fought the wolf to a standstill and, depending on which version of the story one believes, either Sigmar was impressed by the wolf ’s bravery and agreed to spare it, or the wolf was impressed by Sigmar and agreed to spare him. However, both versions of the story are obscure these days.</p>\n<p>Locals know the place only as the Shrine of the Wolf. It is little visited these days, and the inside is dusty and devoid of offerings. No priest attends it, and no pilgrims visit it. </p>\n<h3>The Drakwald College of the Holy Wolf</h3>\n<p>Poking through the shadowy canopy of the Drakwald Forest, far from the Middenheim–Altdorf road, is a steep rocky outcrop topped with a lonely-looking Ulrican temple. This is the Drakwald College of the Holy Wolf, a renowned Ulrican seminary famous for the devotion and piety of the priests it produces, and infamous for the brutal regime to which its initiates are subjected.</p>\n<p>Membership is reserved for those initiates of Middenheim and Middenland who show great promise, and only a dozen are enrolled in any year. Initiates are subjected to a gruelling routine, with frequent beatings, arbitrary punishments, and lengthy rituals. Of the dozen who enroll, less than half become priests, for many flee their harsh masters before ordination. Of course, because the college is deep in the dangerous Drakwald Forest, few who flee make it home alive.</p>\n<p>Many high priests of Ulric have come from the college, including Ar-Ulric Bronnstein, who famously died in battle fighting a Skaven raiding party on the steps of the high temple in Middenheim in 1116.</p>\n<h2>Other Sacred Sites</h2>\n<p>Ulrican holy sites are common across the north of the Empire, especially in Middenland and southern Nordland. Shrines to Ulric line the roads of the north, especially where wolves have their hunting grounds. The most common decorative motifs are a wolf ’s head and a stylised letter ‘U,’ and crude statues of the god are not uncommon. Shrines are tended by wandering priests of the Howling Wolf or by devout locals.</p>\n<p>Most Ulricans also maintain small shrines to Ulric in their homes or barracks. They normally feature a statue where ale can be poured (‘<em>First drink to Ulric!</em>’ being a common toast) beside which weapons are stacked to receive the god’s blessing. Almost every barracks in the Empire, even those in the far south, have such a shrine to Ulric.</p>","folder":"fY94Q1dcxw2okwpa","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Cult of Ulric","sort":200000}}}

There is a lot to tempt them in the vast and bustling capital, but they must hurry if they are to deliver their cargo on time and claim their payment.</p>\n<h2>Parting Ways</h2>\n<p>Depending on earlier events, the Characters will have at least some goodbyes to say.</p>\n<h3>THE BARGE</h3>\n<p>In ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.p6uoMs09lyIar8qc]{Carrion up the Reik}’, the final chapter of Death on the Reik, the GM was given a number of options — some harsh, others less so — to make sure that the Characters no longer own a river barge, and therefore are not tempted to ignore Middenheim and spend the rest of their lives going up and down the Reik as traders. If they still have their own barge at the start of this adventure, some of these options are worth restating.</p>\n<h4>The Law of the River</h4>\n<p>On approaching Altdorf, the River Patrol stops the Characters’ boat for a routine check. The Patrol identifies it as belonging to someone else: the next-of-kin of the boat’s previous owners (whom the Characters found dead aboard the drifting vessel after a mutant attack — see ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.xag3f0PzNfG8kdbw]{A Boat in Need’}) have reported the barge as lost. Since it is registered in Altdorf, the River Patrol there has been keeping an eye out for it.</p>\n<p>A cruel GM might face the Characters with accusations of murder and piracy, requiring them to prove that they found the boat drifting and came into possession of it through legal salvage: @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.JPH3aDjaHPMg9sps]{Josef Quartjin} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.wwwoy9PIIDOQZdF8]{Renate Hausier} testify to their innocence, if they can be found, or a Character  or NPC litigant might need to prove their innocence before a magistrate, which requires extended Tests against Lore (Law), Entertain (Speeches), and/or any other Skill that the GM deems relevant.</p>\n<p>A kinder, and quicker, option is to assume that the River Patrol accepts the Characters’ story grants, according to the custom of the river, that any cargo and profits from their operating the boat is theirs by right of salvage; and insists only that the vessel be handed over to the lawful heirs of its deceased owner.</p>\n<h4>A Friend in Need</h4>\n<p>The Characters’ old friend and mentor, @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.JPH3aDjaHPMg9sps]{Josef Quartjin}, is often to be found in Altdorf. So they are not surprised to encounter him in a dockside tavern. This time, though, he is down on his luck: his beloved barge, the <em>Berebeli</em>, was destroyed in a recent mishap — by mutants or river pirates, or in a collision with another vessel ‘crewed by idiots,’ as Josef says.</p>\n<p>Unless he can find another boat, Josef must either sign on as crew with another owner — an almost unbearable humiliation for a boatman of his vast experience — or sit on the docks and watch his little remaining cash run out. On hearing that the Characters are thinking of going to Middenheim, Josef leaps at the chance to take over their barge for them, promising to keep it well maintained and split any profits with them when they return.</p>\n<h4>The Unexpected</h4>\n<p>If the Characters saved their barge from a fiery end in ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.p6uoMs09lyIar8qc]{Carrion up the Reik}’ they may not be expecting the arsonist to strike again — but perhaps they are mistaken. Their client @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.FTT9hoFswIqAW9do]{Matthias Blucher} has the vessel burned in Altdorf, as soon as their backs are turned.</p>\n<p>If they were still carrying a cargo bound for Marienburg, it is gone, with no clause in their contract saying that the Blucher family will pay for repairs. However, Blucher agents in the capital offer them the lower-paying commission of taking a large crate to Captain Scharlach in Middenheim (see ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.OabDbKp86QR7Ib1Z]{Misfortune Managed}’) if they have not already signed up for the job.</p>\n<h4>In the Market</h4>\n<p>Alternatively, the Characters might decide to sell the barge — which is, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.g796u6AgEQvRPlp7]{in theory at least}, worth 225 GC. Of course, selling a barge is not as simple as taking a bag of money and walking away from the wharf: there is paperwork to be completed in order to transfer ownership and update official registers, and there is the question of the vessel’s age and condition, the number of other vessels on the market locally, and the number of people looking to buy.</p>\n<p>Unless the Characters intend to stay in Altdorf for at least a week — and miss the delivery date for their Middenheim package — they would be well advised to place the matter in the hands of an intermediary. Altdorf and other large river ports are home to a specialised class of merchants who will handle all the details of buying or selling a vessel in exchange for 10% of the purchase price. It should be noted that another 5% is swallowed up by documentation fees, wharfage, taxes, and other expenses.</p>\n<h4>Just Keep the Blasted Thing!</h4>\n<p>Some players might make a game of holding on to the barge despite everything you try in order to deprive them of it, and are very unlikely to let it go just because the Characters have been hired to go to Middenheim. Unless they do something outlandish, like fitting the boat with wheels and sailing it up the highway, they have to leave it in Altdorf and make some provision for its care and safety until they return to reclaim it. </p>\n<p>If this is the only way to get the Characters on the road to Middenheim, then by all means indulge them. While there are storage and maintenance fees to consider, try to keep these low so that the Characters are not unduly rushed into returning from Middenheim before they have a chance to engage with the plot of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. A few silver per week is more than sufficient. If you happen to own the <strong>Death on the Reik Companion</strong>, remind your players that some time in an Altdorf dry dock might be an excellent opportunity to apply some upgrades to their beloved barge. If you intend to continue into <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, then in all likelihood it will be some time before the opportunity again arises for them to return to the vessel.</p>\n<p>And if you really must, they can always return to find the entire dry dock ablaze. Thankfully, Altdorf is never short of an arsonist or two, should the need arise!</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/alex-eisen.webp\" width=\"177\" height=\"205\" /></div>\n<h3>Alex Goes To Middenheim</h3>\n<p>If the Characters came to Altdorf aboard the Blue Salmon, they part ways with @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.Pa77IT9maJR1nU7M]{Alex Eisen} and his crew. </p>\n<p>Alex is enthusiastic about going to Middenheim for the Carnival.<em> ‘Wouldn’t miss it,’</em> he says, in his usual blunt and bigoted fashion. <em>‘Those northerners are a po-faced shower every other time of year, but get a few brandies into one of them at Carnival, and watch out! Ho, ho, yes — you know what I mean?’</em> Unless he has taken a thorough dislike to the Characters, he suggests that they travel together:<em> ‘There’s safety in numbers, you know — and quite apart from the Beastmen in the forest, it’s useful to have a reliable man watching your back in an inn at night — not to mention that Middenheim itself is crawling with the sort who’d slit your throat for the gold in your teeth… present company excepted, of course — I knew from the start that you’re one of the good ones. Anyway, those Elves — you know the ones I mean — never let your guard down, eh? Eh? Oh, yes, we understand each other, you and me.’ </em>Most Characters would probably prefer to avoid him, so they have to come up with some excuse.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/incendiary.webp\" width=\"77\" height=\"186\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/fellow-travellers.webp","folder":"9l20ogJKAnhkPnIw","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":100000}}}
{"_id":"AeQQYBQJpCSlhk9w","name":"Followers of Ulric","content":"<blockquote>\n<p>Ulric give me the fangs of the wolf,</p>\n<p>Ulric give me the claws of the wolf,</p>\n<p>Ulric give me the coat of the wolf,</p>\n<p>And I will show your enemies the mercy of the wolf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As noted on @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.LQ2w4wBqLqxjQxsh]{The Cult of Ulric, God of War}, the cult of Ulric consists of two main orders: the priestly Howling Wolves and the martial White Wolves. Within each order, there are opportunities for devout Characters to follow a number of different careers. A few of them are outlined below, including details on how they differ from the Career descriptions in the WFRP rulebook.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>TERMS OF ADDRESS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Ulrican Priests, Monks, Nuns, and Warrior Priests in the second or third Career level are addressed as ‘Wolf-born,’ or referred to as ‘the Wolf-born [name].’ Characters in the fourth level of their Career claim the title ‘Lord Wolf’.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Priests of the Howling Wolf</h3>\n<p>Not all members of the Order of the Howling Wolf are ordained Priests. It takes people from all walks of life to maintain the temples and other facilities that provide for the faithful of Ulric, and lay members of the order can be following many different Careers.</p>\n<h4>Monks and Nuns</h4>\n<p>While monasteries devoted to the worship of Ulric are not as well-known as those of Sigmar, they are not unheard of. They fall into two broad categories: contemplative and ascetic.</p>\n<h4>Contemplative Monasteries</h4>\n<p>The best-known monastery of this type is the Lore Haus, housed in a wing of Middenheim’s great @JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{Temple of Ulric}. This is the Old World’s greatest repository of Ulrican theology and history, where monks and nuns study ancient scriptures dating back as far as Teutogen times.</p>\n<p>Characters of this type are very similar to the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.bE8g67fjVAE6R7Wx]{Monks and Nuns}, except that their Trade and Lore Skills focus on history (especially that of Middenland, Nordland, Kislev, Norsca, and the ancient Teutogens) and the creation and repair of books and scrolls (printing, bookbinding, etc.). The more senior staff often have some experience as a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.cIBJfaY9DKJh5ZEM]{Scholar}.</p>\n<p>The Lore Haus is also the final authority on the canon law of the cult of Ulric, and its staff includes a few Monks and Nuns who also have levels in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.GhqPa2iwEdc4Dokc]{Lawyer} Career .</p>\n<p>While devoted to their studies, the contemplatives of the Haus do not neglect the Ulrican tradition of keeping themselves fit and trained for combat at all times (many Nuns and Monks of the Lore Haus choose to take Advances in a favoured Melee Skill during their second Career level). From time to time, a few set forth on an expedition to seek out some location from Ulrican legend or a cache of historical or religious documents.</p>\n<h4>Ascetic Monasteries</h4>\n<p>These are smaller and more numerous than their contemplative counterparts. Some fall under the monastic Order of the Winter Throne, but many more are independent. Dedicated to hardening the body and soul through exposure to the elements, physical exertion, and combat training, most of these monasteries are located in remote and barren places such as mountaintops and deep valleys. Some are little more than a collection of small caves in which members of the community sleep, while a few consist of a cluster of rough, hand-built stone huts surrounded by a wall.</p>\n<p>The ascetic Monks and Nuns of Ulric live as close to the wild as they can, hunting their own food as wolves would do. They usually have at least one level in a Warrior or Ranger Career in addition to their religious pursuits, and many are (or become) @JournalEntry[GkT1arSV9rYhYvrG]{Wolf-Kin}, the fanatical warriors whom many compare to the crazed flagellants of Sigmar. See <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</strong> for more on these rugged worshippers of Ulric.</p>\n<h3>The Knights of the White Wolf</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘It is in war that we glorify our gods, for what greater cause is there than to fight and die in the name of Ulric?’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">—<em>Frandegast Ulfheim, Knight of the White Wolf</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Knights of the White Wolf are an order of templars who protect the @JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{Temple of Ulric} and serve Ar-Ulric both in his capacity as High Priest and Elector. They are the oldest and the largest templar order in the Old World, their founding dating back over 2,000 years to the time of Ar-Ulric Wulcan.</p>\n<p>Although they are based in Middenheim, the White Wolves serve Ar-Ulric rather than the Graf. This has been known to cause tensions in the past, but throughout history the holders of Middenheim’s two great offices have taken pains to work together, and Knights of the White Wolf have taken the field alongside Middenheim’s army on many occasions. Almost every temple of Ulric, from the smallest of shrines to the high temple in Middenheim, has at least one or two White Wolves stationed in it.</p>\n<p>White Wolves are tasked with guarding the temples and priests of Ulric throughout the Empire and beyond. Units of White Wolves may be dispatched on quests or missions, or they may be sent to battle, marching as part of the army of Middenland to war, or accompanying a larger templar army on the battlefield. </p>\n<h4>Equipment</h4>\n<p>The Knights of the White Wolf are distinctive, both on and off the battlefield. When on duty or in battle, White Wolves dress in heavy suits of plate mail, lacquered black or treated with dark oils. Every knight wears a distinctive wolf pelt over his shoulders, and it is a rite of passage that every White Wolf must hunt, kill, and skin a wolf with their bare hands in order to become a full-fledged member of the order.</p>\n<p>White Wolves fight from the back of red-barded warhorses, wielding cavalry hammers instead of lances. They refuse to wear helmets, and their flowing hair and long beards add to the ferocity of their appearance on the battlefield.</p>\n<h4>Careers</h4>\n<p>All Knights of the White Wolf have at least one level in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.n2VdkCPNNxdupjeQ]{Knight} Caree, and some are also @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.KG5lVereynSwOkxa]{Warrior Priests}. Their Skills, Talents, and Trappings are as shown for those Careers, modified as necessary to reflect their ability to use a two-handed warhammer from the saddle and their refusal to wear helmets, which they consider cowardly. Most Knights have previous Careers as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.kT0ZI0LoHmIvhjPk]{Soldiers} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.h9LHCAdlP4o55QvD]{Cavalry}.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wolf-claw-amulet.webp\" width=\"189\" height=\"204\" /></div>\n<h3>The Teutogen Guard</h3>\n<p>The Teutogen Guard is an elite unit within the Knights of the White Wolf, and forms Ar-Ulric’s personal bodyguard. They normally fight on foot, but are armed and armoured identically to the other knights of their order.</p>\n<h4>The Brotherhood of the Axe</h4>\n<p>Although they are now technically subordinate to the Teutogen Guard, the Brotherhood’s origins go back to the days before Sigmar, when the Teutogens were the most powerful tribe in what is now the northern part of the Empire. They were an elite warrior society made up of the very finest Teutogen warriors, the bodyguards of the ancient Teutogen warrior-kings, whose names are still enshrined in song and story. When Sigmar united the tribes and founded the Empire, the Brotherhood of the Axe retained their original role as protectors of the Teutogen chiefs.</p>\n<p>Only warriors of pure Teutogen blood are admitted to the Brotherhood, and they must also be warriors of proven skill and unquestioning loyalty to Ulric. They are fiercely traditional (some would call them reactionary) and see themselves as the only true guardians of the old warrior traditions. They arm themselves with great two-handed axes rather than hammers, arguing that the traditional Teutogen war-axe is the weapon of Ulric while the hammer is that of Sigmar.</p>\n<p>Most of the Brotherhood are anti-Sigmarite, and because of this the order is regarded with some suspicion by the Imperial authorities. However, their prowess on the battlefield is unquestioned, and they are widely admired in Middenheim.</p>\n<h3>Lay Personnel</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>ULRICAN SAYINGS</em></h3>\n<p>‘The baying you hear be not mere curs.’ <em>— A grave threat is approaching.</em></p>\n<p>‘The cold fire reveals all.’ <em>— A warning to speak the truth.</em></p>\n<p>‘The word of a Sigmarite.’<em> — A falsehood.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both the monastic and martial orders of the cult of Ulric employ large numbers of lay personnel: devout followers of the god who are not ordained as priests or inducted as knights.</p>\n<p>The temples, and the more contemplative monasteries, employ large staffs of servants, artisans, and other individuals who see to the mundane tasks of construction, repair, maintenance, and day-to-day running. In addition, Ulricans of all types sometimes retire to a monastery for a short time, either in repayment of a vow or to spend some time reconnecting with their faith for other, more personal reasons.</p>\n<p>While inducted Knights of the White Wolf form the core of the Electoral force commanded by Ar-Ulric, they are accompanied in the field by lay infantry and cavalry who are sworn to serve the cult. In peacetime, some serve the temples and monasteries as guards, hunters, groundskeepers, and manual labourers, while others are small units drawn from a particular village or group of farms, training together as part of their devotion to the wolf-god. They usually have one or two levels in a Warrior or Ranger Career, and are led by a Priest or Warrior Priest in their second or third Career level.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE CHILDREN OF ULRIC</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some Ulricans believe that Werewolves are especially favoured by Ulric, who grants them the ability to walk abroad as Human or wolf. Werewolves are sometimes called ‘children of Ulric,’ but they should not be confused with @JournalEntry[GkT1arSV9rYhYvrG]{Wolf-Kin}, nor yet with ‘children of Ulric’ as a term for wolves in general. Officially, the cult of Ulric has neither confirmed nor refuted this folk-belief.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>QUICK ULRICAN NPCS</em></h3>\n<p><em>If you need an Ulrican Priest or other NPC in a hurry, take the standard profile for the NPC’s Career and and make the following additions.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>WS +10</li>\n<li>S +10</li>\n<li>Skills: Lore (Ulric) +10</li>\n<li>Talents: @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.4MJJCiOKPkBByYwW]{Strike Mighty Blow} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.zGQ0ShUTSlUvVtWh]{Warrior Born}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img style=\"margin:-90px 0px;transform:rotate(90deg)\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/blitzbeil.webp\" width=\"135\" height=\"370\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/knights-of-middenheim.webp","folder":"fY94Q1dcxw2okwpa","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Cult of Ulric","sort":400000}}}

{"_id":"AkAGMDpdpRImtgAg","name":"Letters from Afar","content":"<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Helena Horsthelm</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My uncle Dietrich in the Salzenmund Export Company says that the village of Bösel in the southern Middenland has been plagued by mutants flying the banner of a red crown. Recently an Ulrican Priest by the name of Karl Kuten captured a band of mutants bearing the same symbol. At the trial (on the 17th of Vorgeheim) the Imperial Coroner refused to hear evidence against the mutants. Instead he charged Kuten with illegal use of arms and violation of the Mutant Edict. The villagers rioted and killed the coroner and five imperial soldiers, then burned the mutants while three soldiers managed to flee. On the 26th, Bösel was burned to the ground, apparently by Sigmarite templars, although their exact identity has yet to be determined.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Middenlanders are furious and Ulrican hardliners calling themselves the ‘Sons of Ulric’ are openly agitating against Grand Duke Leopold, who has been supportive of the Mutant Edict.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By all accounts, Ostland and Talabecland have been raiding each other across the border, looting towns and burning crops with parties of light cavalry before retreating back to safe territory. Grand Duke Hans-Hals von Tasseninck of Ostland still claims that Grand Duke Gustav von Krieglitz paid for the assassination of his son, something von Krieglitz hotly denies. Neither seems willing to back down, although full scale war seems unlikely as it is now what the kislevites call the ‘rasputitsa’ season - the muddy period of autumn and spring when many roads become impassable. The veterans say that if war is coming it will begin in next year’s campaign season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Frauke von Haalstein</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Debate still rages around the Imperial Ban against the Jungfreuds. The divided Diet lacks the will to support a push into the Duchy of Black Rock, so there is now an uneasy ceasefire with the Jungfreud troops holding the north bank of the Teufel guarding the southern route into the Duchy of Black Rock, and the von Bohrns shielding the north.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crown-Prince Wolfgang has been taking on some of the Emperor’s ceremonial duties at the behest of Graf Archibold von Lilahalle and there is talk of making him the official regent, given Karl Franz’s recent questionable decisions. Some among the Diet, such as Duchess Elze von Skaag, claim that such a move might open the door to the provinces declaring the Emperor incapable and demanding an election.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Crown-Prince himself seems willing to take on responsibility if required, but takes von Skaag's concerns seriously.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Gutele von Bruner</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lady Shalgrid Trott (ghastly woman, almost as bad as her horrid yappy dog) let slip over drinks that Trott’s Marauders have been recalled from Miragliano. If you ask me, they’re heading right down the Tahme to Siedlung to join up with the Jungfreuds, along with anyone they brought back from Tilea (apparently someone has been commissioning half the mercenaries in Marienburg to head south into the Reikland???).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shalgrid’s dog looks like it got hit in the face by a steam tank, I don’t know what its breed even is.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Uncle Steirlich has given Grunewald Lodge to cousin Ludmilla and her fiance Rickard (Aschaffenberg). Maybe some attempt to get the Aschaffenbergs on side? Uncle Heinrich is all about making a claim on Ubersreik at the moment, since he and his brothers are Sigismund’s cousins and all. But Siegfried von Saponaheim is Sigismund’s cousin too, on the other side so he’ll probably have something to say about it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anyway, apparently the Holzenauers are holding a party in Ubersreik which everyone is going to, so they’re probably all going to get drunk and have a punch up about it. I thought I might pop along, it sounds fun.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\"> </span></p>","folder":"XfhUxAdPBRN3lgpw","sort":0,"permission":{"default":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

It shouldn&rsquo;t take the Characters long to decide to either speak to Passerine and attempt to get the diary from her, or to give chase to the child.</p>\n<p>Annika Passerine&rsquo;s Orphanage</p>\n<p>Annika Passerine runs an orphanage that spans half of the second and 3rd floors of Spittlefeld &mdash; the intervening ceiling between the floors having fallen in some time ago.</p>\n<p>The walls and floors inside the orphanage are peeling and heavily damaged but are otherwise clean, as Passerine works hard to keep her children in good standing.</p>\n<p>The orphanage has a kitchen where Passerine and some of the older children cook, a nursery where a half-dozen toddlers and babies sleep, and a dormitory where the older kids live. Passerine herself lives in a corner of the nursery and sleeps on a small cot.</p>\n<p>Annika Passerine will not take kindly to anyone asking questions about her kids. If the Characters pass a Challenging (+0) Charm Test and swear not to harm the children in any way, she will admit that one child, Trinity, has a bad habit of stealing things. She&rsquo;ll state the child is yet to understand why it&rsquo;s bad to steal, but will ultimately refuse to help them get the diary from him, unless they help her first.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Orphan Trinity</p>\n<p>No one knows where Trinity came from or what his name was before Passerine found him. Running out of names, his adoptive mother took inspiration from the three dots tattooed onto his back in a triangle. Now, two years later, Trinity can either be found clutching at Passerine&rsquo;s leg as she does her daily rounds, or crawling through the walls and under the beds of the guests and tenants of Spittlefeld.</p>\n<p>Trinity is still too young to understand ownership, and Passerine does her best to discourage his sticky fingers, which have a habit of picking up the most curious of collectables.</p>\n<p>Trinity is two and a half years old and tiny, with ruddy skin and a beaming smile. He doesn&rsquo;t talk much, but once he gets running, there are few who can catch him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Passerine has several sick children under her care at the moment and needs medicine to help them. Luckily, none of the children have fallen ill with the plague sweeping through the building, and they are expected to make a recovery if they can get the medicine they need. However, with the quarantine, no medicine can come in, and</p>\n<p>Doktor Giliani already used all of her supplies. Sreluc and Srulem, Dwarf brothers who live on the 4th floor, are the only people left in the building who have medicine.</p>\n<p>If the Characters can get some of that medicine for her, Passerine will convince Trinity to return the diary.</p>\n<h3>The Chase</h3>\n<p>Whether the Characters know who they are chasing or not, they may find themselves trying to catch Trinity when he runs away and hides in the crawl space between the walls. Unless there is a Halfling in the party who can squeeze in after him, this will be incredibly difficult.</p>\n<p>It will require the Characters to run ahead and take a gamble by blocking off exits.</p>\n<p>The chase should be run as a Pursuit (Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, page 166). For the purposes of the Pursuit, Trinity has the following Characteristics: Athletics 45, Movement 4. Trinity has a head start of 5 and will continue to move around until his lead exceeds 10, at which point he will leave the crawl space through one of the vents and hide somewhere. Unless the Characters are inside the crawl space, the Pursuit can never fall below 1 Distance.</p>\n<p>Trinity will only move between the ground floor and the first four floors, refusing to go to the penthouse on the 5th floor or to the basement. There is one entrance to the crawl space on each floor in the main stairwell for floors 1st through 5th, and another entrance in the flophouse and basement.</p>\n<p>A Character can use their turn to move up or down the stairs to block off an entrance, but it takes an entire Round just to get to the entrance. Alternately, they can jump over the railing on the stairs to travel farther. Refer to Falling on page 166 of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.</p>\n<p>Each landing is 4 yards above the one below.</p>\n<p>Blocking off an exit reduces Trinity&rsquo;s successive Tests by &minus;1 SL. If the Characters catch Trinity or manage to block off all the exits except the basement, Trinity will begin wailing for Annika and will try to come out. Through tears Trinity will scream that he is scared to go in the basement and will give up the diary. Hearing the child&rsquo;s cries, Annika rushes to help, demanding to know what&rsquo;s going on. It takes a <strong>Difficult (&minus;10) Charm</strong> Test to diffuse the situation and prevent Annika from using one of the Characters as a punching bag.</p>"}

{"_id":"Aps0RoDgsCHqTrkI","name":"The Forge","content":"<h2>The Forge</h2>\n<p>The forge is to the right of the town gates. The forge is made to the same general plan as the cottages, but is larger and squatter.</p>\n<p>To the side of the building, the wide bulge of the furnace tapers upward to a tall flue. The forge roof is tiled in slate. A pile of chopped logs is stacked at the building’s rear. Sounds of hammering and raised voices echo from within.</p>\n<p>Four surviving villagers are inside. They were asleep when the village was attacked, and only saw the terrifying monster from a distance in the gloom of the night. They are somewhat lucid and aware of their situation. However, they are crazed enough to think that they are able to take the monster on if only they could decide what it was that attacked them and how best to kill it.</p>\n<h3>Hugo  the Blacksmith</h3>\n<p> Hugo is the nominal leader of the group — it is his forge after all. He is a huge, muscular, belligerent man from Parravon, and working the anvil has cursed him with painful joints. Hugo is verbose and amuses himself by setting the world to rights when others have nothing to say.</p>\n<p>Hugo briefly caught a glance of the beast before he panicked and hid from it. He believes the creature that attacked the village was a massive toad that lives in the lake to the north of the village. He thinks it attacks people with a long sticky tongue. His plan is to produce a spiky suit of armour in the hope the beast will injure itself as it attacks. He is busy strapping and riveting a variety of sharp objects to an ancient suit of armour.</p>\n<p>Potentially this is a good plan, as the Jabberslythe does use its tongue to attack people.</p>\n<p>However, Hugo has become heedless of the normal safety measures he takes in his forge. He constantly adds fuel to an already raging fire even though he isn’t making use of the furnace. He barks at his companions to fetch more wood and to pump the bellows.</p>\n<p>Hugo only responds to flattery concerning his obvious capability.</p>\n<p>If a Character points out the potential usefulness of his skills and passes a <strong>Very Hard (−30) Charm</strong> Test, Hugo will quickly realise the danger posed by his flaming furnace, and will immediately set about controlling the fire, calling to others for help.</p>\n<h3>Émile Brasseur the Brewer</h3>\n<p>Émile is middle-aged, fat, short, gruff, heavily bearded, and possessed of a nose that looks like a bulbous ripe strawberry.</p>\n<p>Émile is not much of a brewer, but he has assembled a still near his shack from which he irregularly produces batches of cloudy, rough schnapps. Like Hugo, Émile only caught a brief glimpse of the monster before he panicked and hid. Émile argues with Hugo that the monster was a not a toad because it definitely had horns. He also points out that during the attack the monster left Émile’s still untouched, so he thinks it must find schnapps poisonous. He says Hugo should coat his armour in schnapps so that the monster poisons itself when it uses its tongue. This is a silly idea in and of itself. Schnapps will have no particular effect.</p>\n<p>But there are substances in the village that could be employed in a similar way (see the Barbershop and Surgery).</p>\n<p>As Hugo is largely ignoring Émile’s advice, he sits in a corner of the smithy sulking.</p>\n<p>The only way to make Émile respond is to bully him into place.</p>\n<p>If a Character tells him to pull himself together and passes a <strong>Difficult (−10) Intimidate</strong> Test, he quickly becomes lucid. But, moments later, he will begin to moan about his aching head.</p>\n<p>Then moan about the devastation. Then moan about anything the Characters encounter from that point onwards. He won’t leave the Characters’ side for fear the beast should return again.</p>\n<h3>Everard the Builder</h3>\n<p>Everard is an energetic young man in his 20s, tall, dark, handsome, and eager to please. He is simple and holds few strong opinions.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Everard</span>’s inclination is to back up whatever Hugo says. He desperately gathers wood from the pile outside and feeds it into the furnace.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Everard</span> was asleep when the Jabberslythe attacked Griscourt, and all he saw of it was a shape rising into the air near the keep. Perhaps as a consequence of his limited intellect, or maybe because he was never in the vicinity of the creature, Everard appears to be largely unaffected.</p>\n<p>He looks sceptical at the notion that the monster is a great toad.</p>\n<p>If a Character should seek his opinion on the matter he says,<em> ‘I suppose it does look like a toad, sir, in many ways, but I’m sure it had wings. Toads don’t usually have wings do they?’</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Everard</span> follows any common sense advice the Characters should offer.</p>\n<p>He remembers precious little about the morning attack beyond the beating wings.</p>\n<h3>Bruno Boulanger the Baker</h3>\n<p>Bruno is a cheerful man with a gung-ho attitude. When young, he spent some time with a mercenary company and he has had more experience of the wider world than most. He is handsome with close cropped fair hair.</p>\n<p>Bruno suffers from involuntary tics and occasionally blurts out motivational phrases and snatches of songs. This is a nervous condition he had prior to the attack, though it has become worse since.</p>\n<p>Bruno’s memory of the beast is confused. He recalls peering through the dark and seeing a gaping wound on its flank knit together and heal before his eyes. As a result, he is now convinced it was a Troll.</p>\n<p>Bruno came to the forge because he knows about the vulnerability Trolls have to fire. He thinks that if Hugo would help him they could work together to heat up the anvil to an extreme temperature and drop it on a troll. Hugo rightly considers the logistics of such an operation to be impractical, so has dismissed the idea.</p>\n<p>So, Bruno simply helps with the fire as he blurts encouragement to any close by and sings nonsense songs. He says things like<em> ‘This is the life, lads!’, ‘We’re on fire here!’</em>, or<em> ‘The end’s in sight!’</em> no matter how pertinent such expressions are to the situation.</p>\n<p>For all Bruno’s plan is clearly ill-conceived, its inspiration is not without some merit as Jabberslythes do regenerate and fire does impair this ability.</p>\n<p>Any friendly face is likely to win Bruno’s trust.</p>\n<p>If a Character passes an <strong>Easy (+40) Charm</strong> Test whilst trying to win him over, Bruno falls in behind, and won’t stop offering supportive remarks between singing his nonsense rhymes.</p>\n<h3>Getting the Most from the Forge</h3>\n<p>In order to prevent the situation in the forge deteriorating, the Characters have to talk sense into at least two of the men present. If this is achieved, the forge will not burn down.</p>\n<p>Provided he is given enough support, Hugo will complete the job of attaching a number of spikes to the suit of armour at the 1 hour 30 minute mark. Hugo plans to wear the suit himself, but he could be convinced to make a gift of it to any PC who impresses him as a warrior. A Human or Elf around six feet in height could feasibly wear the armour, but it’s the wrong size for anyone else.</p>\n<p>The spiky armour counts as full plate armour (or heavy armour, if using the Quick Armour optional rules). Every time the Jabberslythe successfully uses its Tongue Attack against a Character in the armour, it suffers a Weapon+9 hit using its own SL to hit to determine Damage. Further, any Character wearing the armour ignores any Entangled Conditions the Jabberslythe inflicts with its tongue.</p>\n<p>However, the suit is hastily constructed, brittle, and difficult to maintain. If the armour ever suffers Damage, enough of the spikes break off to render them ineffective. Given that the armour is rather ancient, ugly, and now reminiscent of the spiked suits of armour worn by some servants of Chaos, a Character who wears it outside the context of monster slaying is likely to become an object of ridicule, fear, or a witch hunt.</p>\n<p>Further, Hugo will want it back.</p>","folder":"R0UBIVIt0sDgEI5U","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"AyYqr3arhId1F2F2","name":"High Elves","content":"<p>High Elves are a relatively common sight on the rivers of Reikland. Both Altdorf and Nuln boast sizeable districts populated by High Elf merchants who ship goods down the Reik through Marienburg to the sea. These merchants are by far the most numerous of the High Elves found in Reikland, alongside diplomatic entourages and support staff. Aloof, alien, and long-lived, they are a passionate, emotional folk widely perceived in the Reikland to be the most beautiful of the species, and also the most arrogant.</p>\n<p>Tall and slender with delicately pointed ears, most Elves have long, fine hair and melodious voices. Although they might look frail, their physiology is not only surprisingly strong, but also extraordinarily agile and dextrous. There are very few noticeable gender differences between Elves, which often causes confusion among Humans who interact with them. </p>\n<p>The High Elves, who call themselves ‘Asur’, are native to Ulthuan, a magical island lying to the west of the Old World. A proud species, they boast of being amongst the oldest of the world’s civilisations. High Elves show considerable disdain for Dwarfs, with whom they have a long history of conflict. Since their abandonment of the Old World in the aftermath of the War of the Beard, the Asur have been torn apart by civil war, the ‘kinstrife’, although this isn’t something they discuss openly with outsiders. As a result of this millennia-long struggle, Elves from the war-torn north of Ulthuan tend to be hard-bitten, practical, and ruthless. </p>\n<p>High Elven society is tightly-bound by ritual and discipline, intended to keep soaring emotions in check and provide focus for their complicated intellects. Seeming contrary to this, some Asur revel in wild adventure. The term ‘Sea Elf ’ is often used by other species to describe the dauntless High Elves who venture beyond Ulthuan’s safe shores as mariners, traders, and diplomats, and who stand in stark contrast to any grim Asur accompanying them who follow warrior lifestyles.</p>\n<h3>Opinions</h3>\n<h4>On Reiklander Humans…</h4>\n<p><em>‘They are corrupt, jealous, and rapacious in their short-lived hungers.

{"_id":"B4GNmzNvssniSqYr","name":"The Sigmarite Heresy","content":"<p>The so-called ‘Sigmarite Heresy’ is at the centre of the growing religious tensions between north and south, which threaten to tear the Empire apart. In essence, it is a simple theological difference, but it has come to stand for a number of long-standing resentments and cultural differences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Heed me. It will snow in the Reikland once more, and through the snow, the wolves will hunt.’?’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>–Olaf Eichhorn, Priest of Ulric</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For centuries, the leaders of the cults of Ulric and Sigmar have smoothed over their religious differences in the interests of unity, and only fringe fanatics and hard-line separatists have raised the subject. Since no one took these groups very seriously, the Sigmarite Heresy became more and more of a non-issue, a mere theological curiosity that was, in most people’s view, as ridiculous as the people who argued for its significance. In recent months, though, that has changed — but no one is quite sure how or why.</p>\n<p>In its simplest form, the Sigmarite Heresy proposes that Sigmar is at best an inferior deity to Ulric (some say, a mere demigod who serves Ulric as a shield-bearer) and at worst that he is not a god at all: just the revered memory of a great — but mortal — chieftain. The underlying theology is complex in the extreme, depending on the deep study of ancient legends and chronicles from many sources — not all of them Human — and the very subjective interpretation of key words and phrases in multiple ancient languages.</p>\n<p>The central argument is that since it was the High Priest of Ulric who crowned Sigmar as the first Emperor, the cult of Ulric is the pre-eminent faith of the Empire by right and tradition: every claim made on behalf of Sigmar by his followers, from Emperor to god, derives from the authority of Ulric and his priesthood. Certain extreme positions argue from this basis, and from the fact that no Ulrican source describes Sigmar as a god until well after the Sigmarite Emperors established the power of Altdorf over the whole Empire — Ulric himself never pronounced Sigmar a god. Therefore, Sigmar’s deification was simply a decree made by mortal Emperors, and carries no weight with the gods themselves.</p>\n<p>This issue has come to stand for every grievance that the Ulrican north holds against the Sigmarite south. There are many of these, ranging from resentment of Imperial authority to the foppish snobbery that many northerners perceive (not without justification in many cases) in the actions and manners of visiting Altdorfers. Thanks to the machinations of the Purple Hand, popular sentiment in Middenheim and across the north has been stirred up against the south in general and Altdorf in particular. Aspirations of independence as a separate and completely Ulrican nation have been stoked to the point where violence is starting to break out on both sides of the divide.</p>\n<p>An even more extreme view is currently dismissed by all but the most fanatically unhinged. If Sigmar is not a legitimate god, not recognised by Ulric and the other traditional deities of the Old World, and yet he behaves like a god, granting Miracles and Blessings to his followers, then only one conclusion is possible: that he is really a Chaos God, either a mask worn by one of the four known Ruinous Powers or a separate malign entity. Needless to say, the cult of Sigmar spares neither flame nor sword in its efforts to suppress this proposition.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{The Sons of Ulric}</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<p>‘My friends, let me explain what I mean:</p>\n<p>Sigmar was an Ulrican.</p>\n<p>Sigmar founded this Empire. Thus, the Empire is Ulric’s nation.</p>\n<p>We are all Ulricans! This slavish devotion to Sigmar must end!’’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>—Johann von Schattenlas, Carroburg Politician</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Sons of Ulric were originally an extreme and widely outlawed sect of the cult, whose members claimed to be the blood descendants of Ulric himself and believed that only they were worthy to be his priests. Some Sons of Ulric actively persecuted those who they deemed not to be of pure, unadulterated Teutogen blood, and all were implacably opposed to the growing power of the southern interloper Sigmar and his priests.</p>\n<p>A fractious and disorganised movement, the Sons were constantly splintering into smaller groups following one charismatic leader or another, unable to agree whose blood was the purest and who should lead them. Infighting between groups sometimes became a threat to public order, and the splinter groups visited even greater atrocities upon each other than they did on non-believers, the lax in faith, or the followers of Sigmar. While capable of causing great trouble, they were simply too fragmented to constitute a serious threat, and the authorities did little to stamp them out.</p>\n<p>As the Sigmarite Heresy has reared its ugly head over recent months and north-south tensions — religious and otherwise — have grown to their present dangerous pitch, the Sons of Ulric have become more active, and apparently more organised. Atrocities against the Sigmarite minority in Middenland, Nordland, and surrounding areas, and attacks on coaches and merchant caravans travelling north from Altdorf, have increased in both number and severity, to the point where the Grand Theogonist has called an emergency congress of Sigmarite priests and scholars to discuss the Sigmarite Heresy and seek some permanent compromise to restore peace — the Characters may have heard of this on their travels.</p>\n<p>At this time it is unclear whether the Sons of Ulric are really behind the escalating violence, or whether their name has been co-opted by other groups of religious fanatics, northern separatists, and opportunistic bandits. What is beyond doubt, though, is that their name has never been more prominent, or more widely feared.</p>","folder":"fY94Q1dcxw2okwpa","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Cult of Ulric","sort":500000}}}

He supports the taxes, and many people believe they were his idea. Most see him as a distant and uncaring bureaucrat.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}</h3>\n<p>The Graf ’s champion, little seen except when he issues his challenge to all comers at the Carnival (see @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Carnival Events: Square of Martials}), although he can sometimes be found out drinking with @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} in the city’s better establishments. A lowborn individual who has won renown and position, he is popular in the city — especially since the news broke of his engagement to Kirsten Jung, one of the ladies of the Graf ’s court. He has to retire from his post as the Graf ’s champion in order to marry, and many see this as a very romantic thing to do.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</h3>\n<p>The court minstrel is often seen about town, drinking and playing almost anywhere as the whim takes him: he has even been known to serenade people walking in the parks. He is popular (‘not stuck up like some o’ them Elves you see’), but has very few close friends: @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmeidehammer} is one.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</h3>\n<p>Known as ‘the Princess’ to one and all, Katarina is universally loved for her beauty, grace, and innocence. She may be only a Graf 's daughter by rank, but she has all the attributes of a storybook princess. Young noblewomen copy everything she wears, and young noblemen dream of winning her love. There is constant speculation about whom she might marry and when, which the lack of any official announcement only serves to intensify.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Lady Hildegarde Zimperlich}</h3>\n<p>As chaperone to the ‘Princess’, Lady Hildegarde is a polarising figure. Her detractors (mainly young) think that she is an impediment to the ideal love and perfect wedding that must surely be imminent, while her admirers (mostly old) praise her for keeping the young woman’s reputation secure, and guiding her morals on an upright path.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</h3>\n<p>Everyone knows that the three Midden Marshals are the city’s military commanders. Watch Commander @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann} keeps the peace within the city; General @Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Johann Schwermutt} commands the garrison that mans the walls and gates; and Marshal @Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Maximillian von Genscher} commands the joint field army of Middenheim and Middenland. The general opinion is that all three are competent commanders, but few people know them personally.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The High Wizard and his Deputy}</h3>\n<p>Wizards have played a role in Middenheim’s defence since the earliest days, and @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Middenheim’s Grand Guild of Wizards} enjoys a great deal of influence within the city. High Wizard @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher} and Deputy High Wizard @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} are the faces of the Guild, consulted by the Graf on magical matters, but not generally regarded as members of the court. Helseher is a quiet and reserved man, which leads some citizens to think him very wise but a little stuffy. Eberhauer is younger, more attractive, and more outgoing, all of which make her popular. She is seen as more approachable than her superior, and almost as learned.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}</h3>\n<p>No follower of Ulric uses the phrase ‘high priest of Ulric’ — unless they are explaining his position to an outsider. As head of the second largest religion in the Empire, guardian of Middenheim’s most sacred shrine, and an Elector in his own right, @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} commands enormous respect in the city. Few know him as an individual, but everyone thinks of a paragon of Ulrican virtues when his name is mentioned.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{The Ladies At Court}</h3>\n<p>No court is complete without some ladies to bring it beauty and culture, and to act as guides and aides to visiting dignitaries. Most Middenheimers know, or can work out, that there are four ladies-at-court. Some can name @Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natascha Sinnlich} and @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}, the Graf ’s Paramour. Middenheimers  who frequent the city’s top theatres, restaurants, and hostelries may have seen @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} in the company of @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} and the two Elves, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} and @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}. Almost everyone knows that Dieter and Kirsten are engaged to be married.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{The Knight Eternal}</h3>\n<p>The post of Knight Eternal dates back to Middenheim’s earliest history. Everyone knows of the tradition that his presence protects the city in some imprecise, mystical way. @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} is neither the best knight to hold this ceremonial post, nor the worst — but those who know him would certainly agree that he must surely be the most pompous. To everyone else, he is a cipher: they know there is a person inside that suit of armour, and some may know his name, but it is the post that is important, not the man.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}</h3>\n<p>Hunting is a favourite pastime among the Empire’s nobility. Every landowner with pretensions to quality sets some of their land aside for a hunting-park. A great ruler like Graf Boris maintains vast hunting estates in the Drakwald. Wood Elf @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} supervises these estates. In town, he has a reputation as a hard drinker and something of a heartbreaker, but Allavandrel’s undeniable charisma leads most to see him as a charming rogue rather than a lecherous rake. His defence of his title in the Carnival’s archery tournament always draws a crowd: he has been undefeated for as long as most Human residents can remember.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}</h3>\n<p>If Allavandrel is regarded as a charming rogue, Wallenstein is seen as a rogue of the other variety. The chairman of both the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild} and the City @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission on Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, he walks both sides of the divide between merchants and government, and uses his position to enrich himself first, and his fellow merchants second: everyone else can look out for themselves. Wallenstein is often seen about town, either trying to endear himself to some person of influence at court, or forcing his attention on some attractive young woman. To anyone who is of no use to him, he is unfailingly rude and dismissive.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Doktor Luigi Pavarotti}</h3>\n<p>This ebullient Tilean joined the court fairly recently at the suggestion of Baron Heinrich Todbringer, the illegitimate but acknowledged son who serves @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} as a roving ambassador. Larger than life in both personality and appetites, he has become notorious around the city’s fleshpots and drinking halls, but all agree that there is no real harm in him. It is rumoured that the sickly @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan}, the Graf ’s legitimate heir, is becoming much stronger under his care.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</h3>\n<p>Everyone knows that there are three of them, and they advise the Graf on legal matters. Very few can name all three, and almost no one can tell why there are three, or what the differences are between them. Their names are @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Reiner Ehrlich}, @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Joachim Hoflich}, and @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}.</p>\n<p>They are seldom seen outside the palace or the city’s higher courts.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[DaFBBnxKhlfREOwy]{A Servant of Tzeentch}</h3>\n<p>While in Bögenhafen, the Characters have encountered @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eisactors.IvvkdVTJzutEsrlX]{Gideon}, the shapeshifting Lesser Daemon of Tzeentch who served as an advisor, and ultimate betrayer, to the @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eisactors.LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{adventure’s villain}. As another servant of Tzeentch, the villain may have recruited a similar creature, with similar shapeshifting abilities, to impersonate the murdered party.</p>\n<h3>A Magic Trick</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the imposter is not a monster at all, but a confederate of the Purple Hand using some kind of illusion or shapeshifting magic.</p>\n<p>The Lore of Shadows Spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.OcYPErjJzQKOX2aI]{Doppelgänger} lasts only for a few minutes, but a powerful wizard-artificer could have made a talisman or ring that creates the same effect for as long as the item is worn. The item could serve as a clue to the imposture, since the impersonated character owned nothing like it; and of course, there is always the chance that someone closely acquainted with the subject notices that some mannerism is not quite right.</p>\n<p>A magical potion might have a similar effect, but last only 24 hours per dose. In that case, the regular deliveries of fresh doses might be noticed — and of course, if the supply is cut off, the conspirators have to come up with some excuse or diversion quickly, or fresh suspicions will be raised.</p>\n<h3>A Dead-On Likeness</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the murder victim is impersonating himself (or herself ) thanks to some necromantic magic. After the murder — which must be neat enough that normal clothing can cover any wounds — the victim was raised as a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombie} or similar creature under the necromancer’s control.</p>\n<p>The deception can be maintained as long as the body shows no obvious signs of decay — which might be delayed using a more powerful version of the Petty Magic Spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.cSjAAjixcMdYrKBz]{Conserve}. Speech might be simulated using @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.pDvOunMrvaYoXjd9]{Murmured Whisper} or some similar enchantment, coupled with a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perform (Act)</strong> Test to create a convincing version of the character’s voice. Disguising the clumsiness of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombie’s} movement is more difficult, but not beyond the scope of magic. Eventually, though, this deception has too many moving parts to withstand close or extended scrutiny: sooner or later, something must inevitably go wrong.</p>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/temple.webp\" width=\"307\" height=\"389\" /></p>\n<p>A friendly — or bribed — @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T5qAtpoKtB8iwTBd]{Vampire} might turn the victim undead instead. This process leaves the victim’s appearance more or less unchanged, requiring only a little make-up to hide the sudden pallor. The newly undead victim might be controlled by their Vampiric sire (although not explicitly stated in the WFRP rulebook, this is a common piece of Vampire lore that does not seem out of place), ensuring that they go along with the plan — unless, of course, Vampiric urges overwhelm the neonate’s will, or the ‘sire’ Vampire decides to double-cross the Purple Hand and use this well-placed puppet for purposes of their own.</p>","folder":"WdnGu3bWeo44Lk4e","sort":25000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 3: The Evil Plot","sort":25000}}}

{"_id":"BRFG82wEhR3OCLzW","name":"The Crowds","content":"<p>Middenheim’s streets are packed during Carnival week, and the crowds provide opportunities and challenges in equal measure. One the one hand, characters with suitable Skills can try their hand at busking to make a little money, and characters with the ability to make things can try to sell them; on the other, the crowds make any kind of pursuit or shadowing more difficult.</p>\n<h3>Busking</h3>\n<p>Buskers and street performers are everywhere during Carnival week; every doorway, street corner or steps becomes a makeshift stage. tThe Characters may try their hand at earning a few pennies themselves, and/or using Skills to create a distraction while other party members indulge in some questionable activity.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of people trying to make money at the Carnival, which means the  competition is fierce. The standard of busking and other entertainments is very high — so high, in fact, that substandard performers are often pelted with rotten fruit rather than showered with money! Indeed, some Middenheimers make a few extra coins during Carnival by selling over-ripe fruit with just the right blend of firmness for throwing, and softness to produce a good splatter!</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE BUSKERS ART</em></h3>\n<p><em>The competition among buskers is intense, sometimes vicious, during the Carnival. Middenheim’s resident street performers stop at nothing to defend the best ‘pitches,’ or locations, while there is so much entertainment available that most passers-by are very hard to impress. Only the very best performances, or the most exotic forms of entertainment, will move them to part with their cash. This means that the relevant Tests are modified as follows:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Commonplace Entertainments (–20)</strong>: Entertain (Comedy, Singing, Storytelling); Perform (Dancing —  local); Play (common instrument); Sleight of Hand.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Unusual Entertainments (–10)</strong>: Entertain (Acting); Perform (Acrobatics, Clowning, Juggling, Miming, Dancing — artistic); Play (unusual instrument).<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Exotic Entertainments (no modifier)</strong>: Perform (Firebreathing, Ropewalking); Perform (Dancing — foreign); Play (foreign instrument).</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>You decide whether an instrument or a style of dance is sufficiently novel and interesting to merit a reduced penalty. The same applies to any act the Characters may devise that is based on other Skills.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Presto!</h3>\n<p>Spellcasters may try to busk using their more visually impressive spells, but this can be risky. The consequences are up to you, but may range from representatives of the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Grand Guild of Wizards} warning the Characters that Guild rules prohibit public performance by non-members (this may be true or not, and in either case the officials may imposes a spot fine, which itself may be legitimate or not) to a panicked stampede caused by a miscast, which might see the Characters arrested and charged with anything from breach of the peace to public endangerment to witchcraft.</p>\n<h4>It Looked So Real</h4>\n<p>Performances and demonstrations that require a lot of space will get a busker into trouble, and so will anything that looks like fighting. Warrior types who stage impromptu demonstrations of trick riding, sharpshooting, or combat run several risks in addition to arrest. These risks could include an accident or a sudden surge from the crowd can lead to injuries; passing mercenaries could mistake the demonstration for a fight and wade in — or set out to show off their own skills or ruin the Characters’ performance in embarrassing and painful ways; a near miss or any other mishap could cause a panicked stampede; and so on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the Characters somehow manage to evade arrest for such a performance, they are warmly advised, according to their rank, to try to impress the crowds at the @JournalEntry[asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials} by fighting the Graf ’s champion, or to go and fight the Minotaur at the @JournalEntry[eM2ZiVNgS7dzI2bA]{Bernabau stadium}.</p>\n<h4>We Are Not Amused</h4>\n<p>Apart from flying fruit, a particularly unsuccessful entertainer (for instance, an Impressive or worse failure) may be brought to the attention of the Busk Umpires, a group of officials employed to monitor the quality of street entertainments. The Umpires may be called — if an individual is so bad as to ‘be an affront to the profession or skill he or she is attempting to emulate, and cause embarrassment to any assemblage so gathered.’ The crowd may detain the individual until an Umpire arrives, at which point he or she must perform again; a similar failure results in 6 hours in the stocks for a first offence and an overnight stay in the stocks for the second. A third offence sees the busker expelled from the city.</p>\n<h3>Hawking</h3>\n<p>The crowds draw all manner of hawkers and hucksters. Characters with suitable Skills or careers may try to make a little money for themselves.</p>\n<p>Apothecaries, herbalists, and similar characters may try to sell herbal potions and remedies — those sold as cures for headaches, infected wounds, and upset stomachs are in demand, and gain a +10 bonus to all Haggle and other relevant Tests.</p>\n<p>Pedlars and the like may try to sell their wares to the passing crowds, although anything that is not food, drink, or marked ‘A Souvenir of Middenheim’ suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests involved in selling.</p>\n<p>Mystics and others with similar Skills may try to turn a coin telling fortunes, but this is difficult in high-traffic areas where many people are passing through (–10 penalty): folk in the quieter areas are more willing to stop, but there are fewer of them.</p>\n<h3>Preaching</h3>\n<p>Priests and other religious characters may decide to preach to the crowds, either for money or in the cause of their religion. Agitators may do likewise. If they are too successful, they may draw  a large  crowd and be moved on by the Watch, perhaps with a fine for obstructing a public thoroughfare. If their words or their performance cause offence, they could find themselves in the middle of a riot, or on the receiving end of some well-aimed fruit, stones, or dung. With religious tensions still high, despite the more relaxed atmosphere of the Carnival, Sigmarite priests run particularly high risks.</p>","folder":"lUyL3SvOXg2BFpv2","sort":150000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 5: The Carnival","sort":150000}}}
{"_id":"BV0BU8yGiQ5XreF7","name":"The Themes of Warhammer","content":"<p>WFRP focuses on the following five themes. The conflicts created by these five themes can fuel almost any Adventure. And ultimately, these themes coalesce into the main looming peril of the setting: <em>The End Times</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Class Struggle — Rich vs Poor</li>\n<li>Ideology — Order vs Chaos</li>\n<li>Modernisation — Urban vs Rural</li>\n<li>Factionalism — Us vs Them</li>\n<li>Religion — Cult vs Cult</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Class Struggle</h3>\n<p>Class struggle underpins a lot of the Empire — rich vs poor. Given <strong>WFRP </strong>is focused on the everyday lives turned grim adventures of Imperial citizens, it is one that is seen everywhere. The poor under classes are constantly being pushed around by the rich upper class. The burgeoning middle class is driving a wedge between the two and making both, in many ways, redundant. Wealth, once clutched in the hands of the elite, is being hoarded by those who were born peasants, or whose parents worked the fields in serfdom. This struggle brings revolutionaries, agitators, criminals, and tyrants on to the centre stage, and helps feed into the conflicts presented in all four other major themes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Herr Dohrmann is a ‘merchant’ in the ‘very short-term loan’ business. Dohrmann is always looking for a ‘few steady hands’ to collect on his overdue accounts, occasionally with some violent interest. Characters working for Dohrmann soon find themselves collecting purses of silver from folk living in muddy hovels, while conversely stripping destitute nobles of their still-valuable, if faded, garments.<br><br></li>\n<li>Roswitha Sprenge is a malcontent demanding better treatment for the dockworkers of Kemperbad. While some of her points are valid, when the local merchant council actually tried to address her complaints, she immediately brought up new grievances and her rhetoric turned violent. The merchants want to know if she is an agitator with a grudge or a paid agent of nobles seeking to destabilize the freistadt.<br><br></li>\n<li>There is nothing to be done. The Baron Meinhard Tussen-Hochen is clearly within his rights to punish his peasants that fail to meet their grain quotas. That he should choose to hunt down and slaughter entire families via horseback with Blackpowder weapons is also his right. His fellow nobles will not intervene, the merchants cannot, and the commoners dare not. Will the Characters act or turn away?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ideology</h3>\n<p>Ideology is perhaps the main theme of Warhammer, but exists as a backdrop in the Empire — outside the walls is the untamed wilderness, filled with monsters and the hordes of Chaos, whilst inside them is the order of civilisation. This is, at least, how the powers that be in the Empire want it to seem, but everything exists in a liminal space between the two — Order vs Chaos. Mutants and Beastmen exist as clear evidence that it’s not black and white. Wizards represent Chaos-turned-Order. The barbarism of Witch Hunters, nominally agents of Order, is nothing short of Chaotic. The ever-present Chaos cultists — the dreaded Enemy Within — are everywhere in the Empire. This struggle is what eventually breaks the Old World in half, and leads to the End Times.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Characters are hired by faithful Shallyans to act as guards for the compassionate Doktor Carsta Velsinger, a gifted physician who administers to the poor for a pittance, but is in danger of being overrun by her many frantic would-be patients, and eliminated by agents of other less empathetic doktors who would see her ‘removed’. The real question, though, is what will the Characters do when they discover she is a mutant?<br><br></li>\n<li>Two whole villages burned, all their folk executed, for ‘heresy and acts of sedition against the Empire’ by the Witch Hunter Lothar Rieger — a man that everyone fervently praises, so long as his attention is turned elsewhere. Now, he has apparently set his sights on a village that holds friends and family of the Characters. Does Rieger even believe in innocence, or is he an agent of Chaos, unwitting or otherwise?<br><br></li>\n<li>While travelling by coach through the Reikwald, the Characters are waylaid by a large motley band but promised, in Ranald’s name, that no harm will come to them. It seems that the Outlaw Judge Jirl Strauchrichter needs some ‘objective’ jurists to help with the trial of some bandits who may have turned to Chaos and preying on their fellows. The Characters may learn some strange new ideas from Strauchrichter, who was named an Outlaw because he has odd notions, like people should be considered innocent until proven guilty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Modernisation</h3>\n<p>The Empire is in a state of industrialisation and innovation. Modernisation stretches out beyond the towns into the country increasing tensions — urban vs rural. The printing press puts reading and writing, once the purview of a select few, into the hands of commoners and pamphleteers. Black powder gives the power of the warrior elite to anyone who can point a metal tube at their neighbour and pull the trigger. Innovations in agriculture and manufacturing are seeing a glut of resources flowing into urban centres, which are becoming increasingly separate from their rural dependants. And the advances made in land and sea travel are making what was once a world of isolated pockets of civilisation into… something else. This, of course, brings resentment, and draws a far starker line between the other conflicts. Two peasants may be of the same status, but one can read, has travelled the world, and has seen the face of the Emperor, whilst the other knows only a pitchfork, immediate family, and the plot of land they are forced to work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professor Glockauer of the Imperial Engineers’ School of Altdorf has announced that he will soon unveil a radical new invention — a farming machine able to harvest whole fields in minutes. A group of Village Elders, concerned they may soon be rendered obsolete, hires the Characters to subtlety sabotage the machine so it will fail spectacularly when displayed.<br><br></li>\n<li>During a recent border skirmish between provinces, the Knights of the Sacred Flame suffered a disastrous defeat when a number of their fellows were gunned down by State Troop Handgunners. Their incensed Grand Master Feutchwanger has declared Blackpowder weapons should no longer be wielded by commoners and has already drawn many nobles sympathetic to his view. The Characters are hired by Nuln agents to convince him otherwise, or ‘remove’ him, if necessary.<br><br></li>\n<li>The Apothecary Anja Schwann has systematically expanded her business by making generic medicines using a ‘production line’ of workers. Her drugs aren’t nearly as effective as ones made following traditional ways, but they are far cheaper. The Dwarf Herbalist Kallon Rosewarden is furious with Schwann, both for abasing his work and for her business’ voracious despoiling of the herbs he needs. He hires the Characters to replace a few of Schwann’s medicines with some concoctions of his own.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Factionalism</h3>\n<p>Warhammer is filled with factions that operate under an us vs them mentality — the Elves vs the Dwarfs, the Empire vs Bretonnia, Reiklanders vs Middenlanders, Altdorfers vs Ubersreikers… Identity is everything, and unswerving allegiance to such, and the conflicts that that allegiance causes, are integral. As are the juxtapositions, stereotypes, and exceptions to that rule. Consider the stories told through the stubbornness of Dwarfs and Elves attempting to work together, or a Dwarf Slayer’s unlikely growing respect for an inexperienced Manling agitator. Often this theme is set against a backdrop of ridiculousness and farce — the conflicts are there, but if everyone just set aside their differences, things would go much smoother. And yet, there’s always someone ready to stoke those fires once more, and unpick any steps towards progress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trouble’s brewing on the docks as the Halfling Gaffers Guild recently started having their Ogre labourers haul all their building materials, bypassing the Human Stevedore Guild. The Halflings say they’ve done this because the Stevedores regularly overcharge them, while the Stevedores claim the Halflings unfairly demand that they haul as much as the Ogres can, at just as quick a pace. Both sides want the Characters’ help against the other, with each implying the real problem is just prejudice from the other side.<br><br></li>\n<li>The infamous bandit Gerlach the Gouger has finally been caught, but what should be a cause for celebration has turned nasty. As Gerlach was apprehended at a river crossing, patrols of both Road Wardens and Riverwardens are now claiming the collar, along with the heavy prize purse for catching the cruel Gouger. A fight is imminent, will the Characters help negotiate or grab the Gouger for themselves during the scuffle?<br><br></li>\n<li>The Jade Wizard Kistiane Brockdorf is tired of the endless suspicion she receives at the local market, the aggression of the Watch, and the relentless attention of the Witch Hunter Armin Geringliebe. She decides to give a series of free talks wherein she discusses the role of Wizards in the Empire and shows off a little useful Jade magic, so she hires the Characters to ‘occupy’ the Witch Hunter. The Characters soon discover that Geringliebe is anxious to attend each lecture but, strangely enough, desperate to prevent other Witch Hunters from doing so. It couldn’t be that he’s smitten with the beautiful Druid, could it?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>The Cults of the Empire’s religions are beset on all sides — fighting Chaos, monsters, magic, heresy, and each other: cult vs cult. Whether it’s Ulricans vs Sigmarites, Ulricans vs Taalites, Verenans vs Rhyans, or any other combination of conflicts, the Cults of the Empire are at each other's throats. Furthermore, the Cults are as political as any other group, and often more so than most. This leads to constant infighting, schisming, purges, synods, and other falling-outs among the Faithful. This constant squabbling from supposedly enlightened folk is a perfect symbol of the futility of the Warhammer world. The Gods may or may not be watching over us. They may or may not care what’s happening. Sure, they send us Miracles and Chosen to aid us in times of darkness… but they do nothing to keep their own houses in order, and show no signs of steering their own clergy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The poor folk of Geetberg are desperate, for a plague has afflicted them all, but the medicine needed to cure it is more costly than they can afford. A Priest of Ranald has a solution — use the silver coins interred on the eyes of the dead to save the living, but the Priests of Morr have forbidden it. Are the Characters up for some ‘noble’ graverobbing?<br><br></li>\n<li>Captain Rainer Brusdal of Middenland is offering gold to any mercenaries willing to join the final assault of a heavily fortified bandit stronghold in the Drakwald Forest. The attack will be near-suicidal as his martial advisor, Brother Ansgar, has rejected the cunning battle plan of Sister Dacia of Myrmidia as cowardly, though it would likely save many lives, in favour of an open forward assault to honour Ulric. The Sister’s plan doesn’t need many warriors though…<br><br></li>\n<li>A Warrior Priest of Sigmar, Father Helmut, has tried and convicted a squad of soldiers for failing to obey orders and abandoning their duty guarding one of Sigmar’s temples. Father Helmut doesn’t care that their town was on fire, or that lives were at stake — orders are orders. The Verenan Lorekeeper Irmgard will not let this injustice pass and, despite the potential ramifications, seeks to hire some brave souls to spirit the soldiers away before their execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The End Times?</h3>\n<p>Agitators, seers, and the insane have been declaring the end of the world for many centuries, without seeming effect, but the recent auguries are the most accurate yet. It seems the long-dreaded End Times may be at hand. What does it mean to adventure in a world seemingly headed for inevitable destruction? Are the Characters’ actions still important, or is the very notion of ‘heroics’ meaningless in the face of a looming apocalypse?</p>\n<p>Questions such as these are fundamental to the Warhammer experience, and are one of the main reasons why the focus for <strong>WFRP </strong>is on everyday people. We tell stories about a group of largely ordinary folks marked out for something extraordinary, and then get to see what happens. Will they learn of the pending doom? Will they stand against it? Will they be brought low and succumb to their baser instincts?</p>\n<p>We can’t answer these questions, nor would we, if we could. If each Campaign is built around answering a question, then <em>all </em><strong>WFRP </strong>Campaigns together are ultimately about these questions. As the GM, it’s worth presenting these questions and this theme, behind many threats, if the Characters dig deep enough.</p>\n<p>But the Old World is not without hope, nor without heroism. It’s up to your Players to decide how their Characters face the coming apocalypse and if, ultimately, they can avert it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A blind mystic accosts a Rogue Character on the street, seizes their arm, and whispers, <em>‘You will be the one to fulfil the Architect’s Plan, but it is not too late, turn back! Abandon this course while you still can!</em>’ The mystic then suddenly looks frightened and runs away. The Character is soon approached with several intriguing job offers, all of which sound very lucrative, involving thefts of holy relics. That night, they hear about an inexplicable fire that only took the life of one old witch…<br><br></li>\n<li>It is an open secret that the number of mutant births is on the rise, as are instances of spontaneous mutation. The Lady Silk Shein’s sideline business involving barber-surgeons removing ‘unwanted growths’ and ‘relocating sadly stunted babes’ is booming. She offers the Characters an exceedingly generous retainer to work for her. The job includes eliminating anyone interested in stopping the mutations or seeking their source. After all, can’t let a looming apocalypse interfere with the bottom line.<br><br></li>\n<li>Word has slipped out that in a small village deep in the Reikwald, a child has been born with birthmarks that resemble both the Twin-Tailed Comet and the dreaded Star of Chaos. Old prophecies speak of such a child, saying that they are marked for great and terrible purpose during the End Times.

{"_id":"C9oYvUPgN6gVAWRs","name":"Luigi Pavarotti","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/luigi-pavarotti.webp\" width=\"254\" height=\"262\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Luigi Pavarotti is employed to take care of the invalid Baron @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan Todbringer}. Only recently arrived in Middenheim, he lives in the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{Inner Palace} close by Stefan’s rooms, but is also to be found enjoying the city’s night-life. He can be encountered at a market of some kind (especially one selling food and drink), in a boisterous area, or singing at some hostelry or other. Luigi is a flamboyant, larger-than-life character, tall and heavily built, but with a fair amount of muscle beneath the flab. His face is framed by a wild mane of curling black hair and an unkempt beard. He shouts rather than speaks, gestures wildly, and appears half crazed. Luigi has enormous energy, large appetites and does everything to excess, but is basically a good-hearted soul. He dresses in outrageous attire, and eats and drinks prodigiously. He will flirt with any friendly character he encounters, either subtly or none-too-subtly, according to his estimation of the character concerned. He hails from Miragliano in the Tilean City States, and bursts into snatches of Miraglianese opera at frequent intervals. Luigi isn’t half as uncontrolled as he seems, and merely appears to overlook something he has actually noticed. He is only earnest when absolutely necessary.</span></p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>Luigi cares for the ailing @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan}, and his relative success gives him modest influence with Graf Boris (1 vote).</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Luigi lives in the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{Inner Palace}, close by @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan’s} rooms. He will attend many Carnival events, and is particularly looking forward to the opera recitals. He might also be encountered at almost any hostelry, food market, or house of ill repute. If the Characters witness him ministering to @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan}, they will see him using @Item[vXJq3j6MGR3oThG0]{hypnosis}.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Attractive people and Elves: Anyone with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.6l3jvIAvrKxt0lA9]{Attractive} Talent will always benefit from it when interacting with Luigi, even if they have wronged him in the past. Treat all Elf Characters as if they have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.6l3jvIAvrKxt0lA9]{Attractive} Talent when dealing with Luigi.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Luigi knows nothing important, save for his perceptions about @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} (see below). Beside his modest influence, his main importance is his @Item[vXJq3j6MGR3oThG0]{Hypnotism} skill, which could help free @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} from the suggestions that force him to support the new taxes (see ‘@JournalEntry[m2iCtJ3eBsUwP0Dd]{You Are Feeling Sleepy...},’). His medical and herbal Skills might also be useful.</p>\n<p>Luigi’s devil-may-care attitude and foreign origins may lead to some initial suspicions, and close association with him will cause friction with the more respectable major NPCs (not least the @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Chaperone}). However, if Characters can satisfy his goals and appetites — an expensive, exhausting, and potentially embarrassing undertaking — and clearly mean no harm to him or to the Todbringer family, he can be a very helpful contact.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Luigi has little idea of who influences Graf Boris. He underestimates his own influence, but the Graf would listen to him out of gratitude for his work with Stefan.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Luigi is entirely unconcerned with politics: his goals revolve around carnal pleasures of all kinds, and the welfare of Baron Stefan.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Sadly repressed. Luigi has observed the recent changes in his behaviour and has wondered if Sparsam is taking something, but remains uncertain. He will not mention the possibility unless the Characters suggest it first.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Thinks he may have seen him briefly. Sad that he is to be married; regards marriage as the end of pleasure.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Likes his music and knows of his carousing reputation: would like to know him better.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘Princess’</strong>: Knows that she is far above his station, but has a soft spot for her all the same. Considers her charming, and will voice his support for any likeable Character who attempts to win her friendship, or indeed her heart.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: A repressed old hag who would destroy all pleasures simply because she lacks the capacity for enjoyment.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Knows nothing of them, and will try to steer the conversation toward his own exploits against pirates as an Admiral of the Tilean Navy. His wild (but completely true) stories go on for hours unless someone stops him, in which case he will good-naturedly promise to finish the story later.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Knows nothing of them, but thinks he has seen Janna Eberhauer at a court event, and will beg the Characters to introduce him to her. He has an interest in Jade magic, although he will not give this away. Whilst he is a layman, magic is not strange to him — Luigi has lived an interesting life.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: No strong feelings. Secretly he has noted the High Priest’s anxiety and strongly suspects some forbidden affair, but does not know, or care, who the other party might be.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: Unaware that she is the Graf ’s paramour, and would not have approached her romantically had he known. Admits frankly that she turned him down, and seems genuinely puzzled– especially since he told her of his herbal preparations for enhancing one’s vigour.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Despite his mannerisims, Luigi is the heart of discretion. He does not readily admit to his exploits with Petra and Natasha, but it can be wheedled out of him eventually. Knows Kirsten is to be married (but not to whom) and has made no advances to her: <em>‘Married? Of course! But not one about to be married, for such love is still true!’ </em></p>\n<p>Luigi will wax poetic — in his usual, shockingly forthright way — about the beauty, grace, and charm they bring to the court.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Has never heard of him, but would ridicule him thoroughly if told about him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Met him briefly while slightly hung-over and melancholic; liked him and will be pleased to learn of his dissolute nature, immediately suggesting a party for the two of them and a few friends.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}— Komission Convenor</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Knows them only by reputation, but feels that Middenheim’s licensing laws should be revised so he can go carousing at any hour, day or night, as he could in Miragliano.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer: </strong>He likes Rothbert, as he’s always up for a drink and he knows some interesting people.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Knows that his manner bothers Breugal, and misses no opportunity to cause him discomfort. There is no malice in it, though: Luigi simply can’t help himself.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>He’s never heard of her.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>Pavarotti feels a twinge of guilt that he hasn’t yet visited the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya}. Very soon he will visit to pray, explain his absence, and try to seduce the priestess</p>\n<h3>Luigi Versus Hildegarde</h3>\n<p>If the Characters follow the @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{chaperone’s} suggestion to try to remove Luigi, the Physician will readily forgive them and hatch a counter-plot should they inform him. This could work to their advantage.</p>\n<p>Luigi can let the Characters know that for all her apparent airs @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde} loves nothing more than a tense game of cards, @Compendium[wfrp4e-rnhd.pubgames.pWlAzCU8HjElHsqC]{Red Empress} and Cripple My Pig being favourites. If the Characters can host an entertaining game at a suitable venue, and keep the wine flowing freely, the chapperone will likely spend the following day dealing with her hangover. In order to do this successfully characters would have to meet Hildgarde at an event such as the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}, tactfully suggest to her that they are serious players about to host a game with moderate stakes (she would consider penny stakes too cheap, but crowns to be too vulgar), and then remain charming whilst ensuring that she is challenged without being trounced. Provided the games are closely fought and the atmosphere convivial, she will happily drink herself into a stupor.</p>\n<p>While this will not remove Hildegarde completely, she will be less perceptive than usual while hungover (-30 to all Tests in locations of bright light or loud noises — essentially every Carnival event), and may fail to accompany @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katerina} at all if she is feeling particularly poorly. This will allow Characters an opportunity to make Katerina's acquaintance and benefit from whatever insight, introductions, and prestiege conversing with her might provide.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Reictals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Lightsingers}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Barnumble’s Incredible Elephant Show}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 3}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 4}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Final}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 1)}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 2)}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>\n<h3>Pavarotti at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>Any time the Characters are abroad late at night they could meet with this extraordinary man, either in some hostelry or as he makes his way home. Any friendly Character, of any species, gains his immediate attention, and a positive interaction — especially one involving food, drink, or other pleasures — might get them invited to the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}.</p>\n<p>Pavarotti is happy to talk about medical matters with any suitably skilled Character, but even happier to indulge in food, drink, and other activities with any characters who can keep up with him. He is intrigued to learn of the Characters’ suspicions about @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, and can diagnose and reverse his hypnotism if the Characters think to involve him.</p>\n<p>Outside of the Carnival events, a good way for the Characters to meet Pavarotti is on a darkened, quiet street very late one night. The Doktor runs by them, laughing and clutching his trousers and boots in one hand as an outraged spouse pursues him, dressed in a nightshirt, nightcap, and carpet slippers and brandishing a blunderbuss. Perhaps the Doktor stumbles or stubs a bare toe, leaving him momentarily at the mercy of his pursuer; if the Characters can step in, knock the barrel of the gun upward before it fires, or do anything else to help him, Pavarotti insists on treating them to an epic drinking session which lasts at least until dawn and probably until noon. Thereafter, if the Characters have proven to be good companions, Pavarotti becomes their fast friend — which can be useful but also exhausting, as he insists on going drinking with them all night, every night.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Pavarotti does not know many of the other major NPCs well, and regards even fewer of them as friends. However, he can be useful in getting the Characters into all manner of drinking establishments, identifying the Pit as a good place to buy illicit substances — and, of course, freeing @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} from his post-hypnotic suggestion.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\" style=\"border-left:3px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary)\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">A RED HERRING</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">If you  wish, and if they are feeling supremely confident, it may be beneficial to introduce at least some of the Law Lords before the final act of the adventure. After all, if the Players feel that you have been steering them away from the Law Lords — they may well begin to smell a rat. It might also be more satisfying if the Characters, upon finally unmasking the culprit, feel that clues as to their identity were laid down earlier in the narrative. The principal risk is that a Character figures out early on who the culprit is. If you decide to be daring and allow them to meet Wasmeier, you should be careful in how you present him. If he comes off as obviously evil, then players unconsciously begin to suspect him. Conversely, if you overcompensate by making him too friendly or helpful, this appears just as suspicious. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">The best presentation for @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} is the one which he already shows to the people of Middenheim — that of a somewhat aloof but dedicated and fair arbitrator of the law, and a neutral advisor to the Graf. Consider having him deflect any concerns about his role in the new taxes by muttering that, while the Law Lords present a single opinion to the Graf, he certainly didn’t vote for it. If the Characters pester him for assistance, have him direct them to gather some arbitrary number of signatures from the populace, which he promises to present to the Graf on their behalf. It will make for decent kindling, if nothing else. Wasmeier is happy to have inquisitive Characters tied up in such busy work, though undoubtedly he will also keep a close eye on anyone that seems too dedicated to their inquiries, and will send some muscle to deal with anyone who he deems to be a risk.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/luigi-pavarotti.webp","folder":"YbdT1wAfqZmWtR79","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}

The party might be attracted by the noise of the mob, or by the sight of the Chancellor running through the streets, dodging a barrage of rotten fruit, or worse. If the party has a Dwarf member, they may not need to wait for a mob: a Dwarf Character could decide or be convinced to attack the Chancellor, allowing the other Characters to ‘rescue’ him.

Any entertainer who proves by use of a stamped card that they have spent at least three hours playing in the streets of Altdorf can take it to Empire House in return for 2 shillings. The streets are therefore full with the players of citterns, mandolins, hurdy-gurdys, dulcians, flutes, lutes and drums, as well as small crowds gathered to cheer on or mock their performances.</p>\n<p>This has no real effect on the scenario other than to effect some character and maybe provide a distraction.

It is well known that halflings have a predilection for smoking and so Drago has rented a dockside bedsit and a large wooden Averland mountain horn. He has stuffed the horn with Mootland leaf and bound Bernhardt to the mouthpiece, plugging his nostrils.</p>\n<p>After first meeting the PCs in the company of Hiero, Drago went to the bedsit and lit the contents of the horn, he then left the place, leaving his victim to asphyxiate on the fumes from the giant &lsquo;pipe&rsquo;. However, this time someone has spotted the murder in progress, as gouts of smoke are leaking from the room and as the PCs are walking by the Docks or in the Street of 100 Taverns they hear cries of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>They now have 20 rounds in which to rescue Bernhardt before he is overcome by the fumes.</p>\n<p>Keep a log of the decisions they make.</p>\n<p>If they run straight to the scene (5 rounds) they must break down the front door (requiring a<strong> Very Hard (-20) Strength</strong> Test). The stairs are filled with smoke, they can be run up, which requires passing a <strong>Hard (-10) Agility</strong> Test but only takes 1 round, or they can climb up carefully in 4 rounds. They then have to break down the door to the room by passing a<strong> Hard (-10) Strength</strong> Test). Bernhardt is tied to a chair in the middle of the room by his hands and feet. Plugs of wool have been rammed into his nostrils and his head is lashed to a large wooden horn by many loops of twine. The end of the horn is filled with smouldering Mootland leaf.</p>\n<p>If the twine is cut within 20 rounds of them first hearing the call of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; the PCs will have rescued Bernhardt and he will be sensible enough to help with their enquiries.

She has a workshop in the Artisan district, a couple of streets from Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>She was quiet, but kind, friendly enough, if a little shy. &lsquo;She was a bit standoffish,&rsquo; is the worst thing anyone might have to say about her. No one could think of any reason why someone might want to kill her. Her death was put down to a senseless madman, until another master cobbler was killed a couple of days later.</p>\n<p>Boecks was killed on the Festag morning in the early hours. The evening before, soon after Mystic Myrtle&rsquo;s fair arrived, Br&ouml;gue walked into town carrying the three Daemons in a bag. He released them near to Boecks&rsquo;s house and walked back to the fair site just outside town.</p>\n<p>After waiting for the darkest hour of the night, Pumpf flew Schn&auml;ker up to the roof of Boecks&rsquo;s workshop before flying back down to pick up Dappz. However, finding Boecks&rsquo;s fire still lit, they abandoned their plan to climb down her chimney. Instead, Pumpf flew them all to a high window under the eaves. From there they could see Boecks in her bed. They broke one of the panes of the window; it was only around 8-in square, but easily big enough for them to pass through.</p>\n<p>Boecks heard the glass breaking and began to stir. In response, Dappz cast Creeping Menace to scare her into staying in her bed, distracting her, and giving them time to climb down from the window and attack her in her bed, leaving her body with many tiny scratches, pin pricks, bite marks, and bruises.</p>\n<p>Once they had overpowered her, Dappz cast Treason of Tzeentch to make her see her failings and all the ways in which she had betrayed Br&ouml;gue. As she faced these untruths, the puppets began stitching her into her bedclothes.</p>\n<p>The puppets continued stitching more and more layers of bedclothes tightly around Boecks&rsquo;s body and over her face, until all she could do was attempt a final well-muffled scream and then die from suffocation.</p>\n<p>As they were about to leave, Schn&auml;ker noticed the statuette of Verena standing on Boecks&rsquo;s dressing table, which had witnessed the entire incident. In a fit of temper, he knocked it onto the floor and breathed pink fire over it, melting and changing the wood. Zahndahl took possession of the warped statue and she lets the Characters examine it, if they ask.</p>\n<p>Br&ouml;gue came into town first thing the next morning to collect his puppets and put them back in his sack. Boecks&rsquo;s body has already been put to rest in Morr&rsquo;s Field and there is no way the Characters are able to get permission to disinter it. If they want to have a look, they must dig it up themselves.</p>\n<p>If the Characters visit the scene, they see that the room is neat and reflects Boecks&rsquo;s tidiness and professionalism. The tools are set about remarkably neatly, and everything in the workshop seems to have been, and be in, its correct place.</p>\n<p>Boecks&rsquo;s living quarters are above the shop. There is now no sign of the crime. Boecks&rsquo;s body has already been sent into the cult of Morr&rsquo;s care, the room has been well cleaned, and the bed clothes destroyed.</p>\n<p>What should be clear about the room is that the &mdash; now repaired &mdash; broken window is not big enough for anyone to climb through, except perhaps a young child or the smallest Halfling. The window itself does not open, so it was not a case of breaking one pane to reach a latch.</p>\n<p>Zahndahl offers the observation that because Boecks was virtually &lsquo;stitched to death,&rsquo; suspicion fell on the other members of the Cobblers&rsquo; Guild. She even questioned Friede Schlypper about it. Schlypper was very helpful and pointed out that each cobbler has a distinctive stitch that those in the know should be able to recognise. Schlypper was sure that she would have been able to recognise the stitching around Boecks&rsquo;s body if it were done by a cobbler she was familiar with. However, she did not recognise the style. She said that there seemed to be three different stitchers, all of whom were very skilled and neat, but none of whom, she was sure, she had ever come across before.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, she suggested, they had all been apprenticed to the same master cobbler.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%; height: 136px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 44.0313%; height: 17px;\">Stitched into her bed</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.1874%; height: 17px;\">Br&ouml;gue&rsquo;s motive, suspects her of wantonness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 44.0313%; height: 17px;\">Scratches, pin pricks, bite marks, and bruises</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.1874%; height: 17px;\">Zahndahl will mention this</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 44.0313%; height: 17px;\">It occurred soon after the fair arrived</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.1874%; height: 17px;\">Deduction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 44.0313%; height: 17px;\">The fire had been lit</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.1874%; height: 17px;\">Zahndahl will remember if asked</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 44.0313%; height: 17px;\">The broken pane was very small</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.1874%; height: 17px;\">Zahndahl will point it out</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 44.0313%; height: 17px;\">Magical Winds of Tzeentch</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.1874%; height: 17px;\">Still faintly permeates the crime scene</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 44.0313%; height: 17px;\">Deformed statue of Verena</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.1874%; height: 17px;\">Zahndahl will mention it, Tzeentch magic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 44.0313%; height: 17px;\">Distinctive Stitching</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.1874%; height: 17px;\">Zahndahl will mention it.

{"_id":"EWhez41BvMuwznUT","name":"NPC Strategy","content":"<p>Obviously, this depends on how much warning the pawns have, if they are asleep at the time, and so on. If they have already made an attack on the Characters they will be highly vigilant, and likewise, if the Characters have announced their presence by smashing down locked doors, they will be forewarned. These NPCs are fairly brave (save for @Actor[eeJoYIenRt8CbtVU]{Anton}): @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde} and @Actor[klwNbpAHe1oQ1oo6]{Dagmar} are unlikely to surrender, and @Actor[frMWa4mngN7z7n3g]{Hultz} will not do so unless offered amnesty. It is unlikely that any will be able to escape, although Brunhilde will try to get away to warn Wasmeier. Unfortunately, even if she does escape, Wasmeier will not be at home for most of Festag night, having other plans for the evening (see @JournalEntry[Vc09tZNuKQcfD7QP]{The Court Climax})</p>\n<h3>Advancing The Plotline</h3>\n<p>If the Characters discover the lair on Festag night, events are set to increase in pace. Assuming the love-letters have been found, the Characters should be able to guess who wrote them, and how politically sensitive they are. Even if they were unaware of the blackmail pressure on Ar-Ulric before, they should now understand why he has been silent on the tax issue. However, Reya Ehrlich is their biggest gain by far.  i. When ungagged, Reya will prove to be an independent and plucky sort, demanding to be taken to her uncle @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich} — ‘he’ll know what to do!’ — or someone else in authority. In all probability, the Characters are quite unaware of the pressure exerted on @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich}, and Reyas presence should be one more piece of the jigsaw.</p>\n<h4>Premature Annihilation</h4>\n<p>If the party deals with the pawns before Festag night, things change slightly. Reya Ehrlich is not in the lair. Instead of love-letters, the party finds a partly-burnt scrap of paper in the ashes close to the aviary. All that is readable (in code) is a place (of your choosing, in the @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}), and a time (11.30pm Festag night). This is where another group of cultists — or the Skaven, if they have not yet been encountered — hand over Reya and the love-letters to Klaglich. After that, events should continue as described above.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich}  is killed, the first @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} knows about  it is when she fails to act on one of his messages, which may take time. He starts investigations using minor cultists, and if he discovers the lair has been attacked, he instructs a second group of cultists to take delivery of Reya and the letters. Since the original lair has been discovered, the cultists will plant the evidence in another run-down house. This meeting could get very complicated as both Characters and cultists wait for the same ‘shipment.’</p>\n<p>Finally, if @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} escapes an early attack, @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} will be warned immediately. Since neither of them knows that the Characters know of the handover on Festag night, there is no reason why the aforementioned delivery will not take place, but in this instance, it will be Klaglich waiting for the girl and letters, rather than other cultists. She  then plants the evidence as described in @JournalEntry[Vc09tZNuKQcfD7QP]{‘The Court Climax’}.</p>","folder":"8RbZHSArNQNSMvQ7","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 7: The Traitor Unmasked","sort":200000}}}

{"_id":"EbwOpdSrBetwXypd","name":"Wood Elves","content":"<p>Wood Elves are a rare sight in the Reikland, and for good reason. During the closing stages of the War of the Beard, most Elves retreated from the Old World, but a few remained and withdrew to the depths of the magical forests they now called home. Over three thousand years of isolation, hardship, and warfare then ensued, leaving ‘Wood Elves’ culturally very different to their High Elf cousins. </p>\n<p>Wood Elf life is entwined with nature, with a society intermixed with spirits of the forest. They are separatists who work hard to hide themselves away, with arboreal outposts cunningly concealed with powerful illusions and misleading magics. On the rare occasions they travel beyond their borders, it is usually for war, as often with their neighbours as with darker forces, leaving other peoples of the Old World deeply unsure of the fae, capricious Elves.</p>\n<p>There are two kiths of Wood Elves most commonly seen in Reikland. The ‘Asrai’ from Athel Loren across the Grey Mountains, and ‘Eonir’ of the Laurelorn Forest far to the north in Nordland.</p>\n<p>The ruthless Asrai of Athel Loren are xenophobic and secretive, and rarely venture beyond their borders. However, a decade ago, Naith the Prophetess foresaw the possible death of Athel Loren. In response, the King and Queen of the Wood, recognising the fate of their forests may lay in the hands of outsiders, sent tattooed kinbands out from Athel Loren to take action, hunting the enemies of the forest at the source. </p>\n<p>These ferocious bands are sometimes led by a spellsinger who calls upon the old, magical paths of the Worldroot to transport them between Athel Loren and the depths of other forests long lost to the Elves, but not yet consumed by civilisation or Chaos. Occasionally, these wild hunters perceive some common cause with other Old Worlders and an individual may step from the shadows to join with those fighting a greater evil.</p>\n<p>By comparison, the Queen of the Laurelorn takes a very different path to the foretellings given to her and has recently sent a sizeable delegation to make camp in the deep forest of the Amber Hills just south of Altdorf. These Elves observe Human politics concerning the Laurelorn and beyond, and occasionally intervene on matters deemed important. The camp is viewed as a ‘temporary’ solution by the Elves, but the meaning of that word is very different to the long-lived species. Because of this camp, these Wood Elves are a growing presence in Reikland as they venture from the trees and wander according to their inscrutable purposes, often as hunters or entertainers.</p>\n<h3>Opinions</h3>\n<h4>On Reiklander Humans…</h4>\n<p>‘I see hateful creatures with darkness in their hearts and a complete disrespect for order.

{"_id":"EgezB9BzxKmohox9","name":"Grubentreich","content":"<p>The village itself comprises around 80 simple country folk, who make a moderate living from agriculture and livestock.</p>\n<p>Mathilde and Eduard Jung, the sisters’ aunt and uncle, run the <em>Black Sheep </em>tavern. They are grateful to the Characters for having rescued their nieces, and offer the party free accommodation, food, and drink for the night. Unfortunately, the inn’s two guest rooms have already been taken, but the taproom is clean and warm.</p>\n<p>If the Characters don’t mention the encounter with the flying skull, one of the girls certainly does so. This may happen while the bar is still full of locals, or last thing at night, as Eduard locks up the tavern. Talking with the locals brings nothing more than sceptical comments about ‘bumps on the head’ obtained during the crash. Eduard is not so dismissive, though. The description of the crash backs up the rumour he heard two days ago from Werner Geizhals, a wine merchant returning from the nearby village of Pritzstock.</p>\n<p>According to Geizhals, who travelled on to Middenheim for the Carnival, the folk of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} gave him the impression that the village was cursed. There were tales of the dead prowling around the outskirts of the village, and of phantom, flying skulls haunting the woods. Eduard broaches the subject with the Characters quietly, after the tavern has emptied out for the night. If they are real, these flying skulls should be dealt with before the threat spreads to Grubentreich, and who better to deal with them than these recently arrived adventurers?</p>\n<p>If the Characters look like they do not intend to investigate, Eduard elaborates on the rumours, making up tales that the skulls are thought to guard some long-lost treasure or whatever else he thinks will motivate the party to investigate. Bertha will not hesitate to urge the Characters to assist, especially if during the coach tide they told her tales of their previous exploits. Finally, should all else fail, Eduard will offer @Credit[2gc,SPLIT]{2 GC} as recompense if the Characters should investigate. He and Mathilde are worried that the worsening reputation of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} will spread and cast a cloud over Grubentreich and the <em>Black Sheep</em>.</p>\n<p>As chance would have it, three of the inn’s other guests are travelling through @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} the following day: a farmer named Hans Krug, and handymen Pieter Klammerer and Albrecht Krupp. These three retired to the guest rooms early, but are returning to Leichlinberg via Pritzstock tomorrow. The Characters could get a lift to the village on Krug’s carts.</p>\n<p>The Characters must rise early to ask Hans Krug for a spot on the carts, so woe betide those who over-indulged on Eduard’s hospitality. The farmer agrees willingly enough, but asks for @Pay[1ss]{1 shilling} each as payment. He can be bargained down to @Pay[6bp]{6 pennies} each, but being poor he tries to make money whenever he can. Talking him down requires a successful <strong>Difficult (–10) Haggle</strong> Test. If the Characters really need encouragement to investigate, Eduard offers to pay the fare. They need have no further concern about Elise and Bertha: Eduard assures them that he will personally escort them to Middenheim on the next coach.</p>\n<p>The journey to @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} takes about three hours on Krug’s cart. The only other way that the Characters could make the trip is on foot, as there are no horses available for hire or sale. The farmer and his assistants know nothing of events at Pritzstock, having just returned from a trip to Middenheim.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/villagers.webp\" width=\"282\" height=\"265\" /></div>","img":null,"folder":"O0HfGcMmqK25GSdm","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":300000}}}

It is recorded with tokens — be these coins, cards, chits, counters, or specially designed Advantage tokens — or by a tally sheet on scrap paper.</p>\n<h3>Options: Limiting Advantage</h3>\n<p>Some GMs prefer a more controlled combat environment that isn’t so influenced by the whimsy of dice and luck. As Advantage can swing wildly during the course of a battle, and can have a significant impact, consider using one of the following optional rules if you wish to contain this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advantage has an upper level equal to each Character’s Initiative Bonus.</li>\n<li>Cap Advantage at a pre-arranged limit, such as 2, 4, or more. 10 also works well as you can easily track it with 1d10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Gaining Advantage</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advantage </strong>is secured each time you win an Opposed Test in combat, you assess the battlefield using your Skills, or when your spirits are lifted. The following provides some examples of this, but is far from exhaustive, and the GM is encouraged to hand out Advantage tokens as suits the circumstances.</li>\n<li><strong>Surprise</strong>: Attacking @Condition[Surprised] enemies brings +1 Advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Charging</strong>: Charging headlong into combat grants +1 Advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Assess</strong>: If you use one of your Skills to secure a tactical advantage, gain +1 Advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Victory</strong>: Whenever you defeat an important NPC, gain Advantage. Subduing a party nemesis may grant +2 Advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Winning</strong>: If you win an Opposed Test during combat gain&nbsp;Advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Outmanouevre</strong>: If you wound an opponent without engaging in an Opposed Test, gain +1 Advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Benefits of Advantage</h4>\n<p>Each Advantage you secure adds +10 to any appropriate combat Test or Psychology Test. Thus, if you have 5 Advantage tokens, you have an impressive +50 bonus to hit, defend, and resist the influence of others.</p>\n<h4>Losing Advantage</h4>\n<p>If you lose an Opposed Test during combat, suffer any Conditions, or lose any Wounds, you automatically lose all Advantage. Further, should the combat end, all Advantage you’ve gained is lost. Lastly, if you have accrued no Advantage for the Round, or end the Round outnumbered, you lose 1 point. Advantage can also be used to Disengage from combat.

Ringed by glaciers, the pass through the centre of the fortified fiefdom is usually impassable in the depths of winter. Though it has been decades since the last conflict with Parravon, the State Army regiment garrisoned in the march is always ready, which is especially prudent given the number of Greenskin tribes making their home in the mountains.</p>\n<p>Graumarkschlosse, the fief &rsquo;s largest castle, is located high on the cliffs to the north of the road overlooking the pass. Entrance is made via a complex lift powered by steam. The pass is littered with the ruins of less fortified castles sacked by Greenskins in previous centuries. Now the blackened bones of these fallen fortresses are home to nothing more than the restless shades of the fallen. The only other settlement of any size is Teuquelle, a frozen village heavily defended with cannons and mortars.</p>\n<p>Margrave Tobias Aschaffenberg, eldest son of Brynich Aschaffenberg, became the ruler of the March after the previous margrave died without heirs. Even though he ruled the province for several years, Tobias had never set foot in the isolated, freezing barony until recently.

But when the Jungfreuds lost Ubersreik, Tobias&rsquo;s father sent him to Graumarkschlosse to put his house in order, ensuring the defenses were unimpeachable to better enhance the Aschaffenberg name and ensure Grey Lady Pass didn&rsquo;t fall under the sway of another Noble House.</p>\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span> The Grey Lady Pass is home to undying rumours of the Grey Lady, a restless spirit who appears as an omen of impending doom.

{"_id":"FOwE3F63OT83lSgV","name":"Skills and Talents","content":"<p>Skills represent areas of trained learning or experience, and Talents describe special abilities your Character can access. A list of all Skills and Talents is provided in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents. The Skills and Talents you have available to you at character generation are determined by your Species and Career.</p>\n<p>When you learn a Skill, note down the number of Advances you gain in the Advances box of the Skill. If you should learn this skill again, add the extra Advances to the old total to create a new number of Advances. If you learn a Talent, record it in your Talent list on your Character Sheet.</p>\n<p>Skills are classified as either <em>Basic </em>or <em>Advanced </em>. Basic Skills represent common abilities that everyone can perform &mdash; you can use these skills without any Advances in them, at a level equal to the governing characteristic. Advanced Skills require specialist knowledge, and you can only use these skills if you have taken at least one Advance in them.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some Talents can be learned multiple times. If you have an opportunity to learn a Talent a second time, check the talent on your character sheet to see if it can be learned multiple times, and mark how many times you&rsquo;ve learned it on your Character Sheet.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>What Are Skill Advances?</em></h3>\n<p><em>Like Characteristic Advances, Skill Advances show specific training in a Skill. All Skills are associated with a Characteristic, and the number of Advances you have in the Skill is added to that Characteristic to show you how skilled you are. So, as Climb is associated with Strength, if you have a Strength of 38, and 8 Climb Advances, your Climb Skill is 46.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Each Species has a variety of Skills and Talents to choose from. You may choose 3 Skills to gain 5 Advances each, and 3 Skills to gain 3 Advances each. If a Talent listing presents a choice, you select one Talent from the choices given. Any Random Talents are determined by the Random Talent table. If you roll a Talent you already have, you may reroll. <strong>Note</strong>: All Characters are assumed to be fluent in Reikspiel,, the language of the Empire, and do not need to take it as a Skill.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong><em>The Species skills/talents are shown via the '/char' command, as well as the random talents.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Career Skills and Talents</h3>\n<p>You begin at the first Career level listed in your Career Path. There are 8 Skills and 4 Talents listed with that level, and you can choose which of these you are most proficient at. Allocate 40 Advances to your eight starting Skills, with no more than 10 Advances allocated to any single Skill at this stage. This is enough for you to add 5 Advances to every Career Skill if you wish, which is one of the required steps to complete your Career if you wish to move to a new one (see Changing Career on page 48). You may also choose a single Talent to learn.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:<em> Lindsay is creating a Human Noble Scion, which has the following Career Skills: Bribery, Consume Alcohol, Gamble, Intimidate, Leadership, Lore (Heraldry), Melee (Fencing), Play (Any). She decides the character is well-schooled, but naive, so chooses to ignore the Bribery, Consume Alcohol, and Gamble Skills for the moment, and spreads her 40 Advances like so: Intimidate +7, Leadership +10, Lore (Heraldry) +10, Melee (Fencing) +3, and Play (Harpsichord) +10. Note: Lindsay can do this even if she has already allocated Advances to Leadership for being Human, as the limit of 10 Advances to a single Skill applies only during this allocation of 40 Advances.</em></p>","folder":"Q0UfttGS2ZpKyqfG","sort":800001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Character"}}}
{"_id":"FX9rb0LL6BStC7T8","name":"Career Advancement","content":"<p><em>‘Well, I play a character with no class at all who would sell his grandmother for career advancement; you know, exactly the type of fellow frequently encountered in my line of work.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Detlef Sierck, Playwright and Actor</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"> </p>\n<p>Your Career is your job when not off adventuring (or having adventures done to you, as may often be the case). It describes your training, social class, and your future prospects. <strong>WFRP </strong>groups similar Careers into Classes.</p>\n<h3>Classes</h3>\n<p>A summary of each Class is found in @JournalEntry[qiN0uSuMBBPqpc64]{Class And Career}. Classes organise Careers into easily referenced groups. They also impact character development, provide different starting Trappings during Character Creation, and influence how you can change Career (see Changing Career). Some Classes have access to different Endeavours — activities you can take between adventures.</p>\n<p>The summary and illustration at the top of the eight Careers in your chosen Class should give you a good idea of which is the one for you. The Careers can be considered to be as broad as possible, so you are encouraged to interpret them imaginatively as part of your Character concept.</p>\n<h3>Career Levels</h3>\n<p>Every Career has four levels, each progressively better than the last. If you take a look at Apothecary, the first Academic Career, you can see the four levels are: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Apprentice Apothecary</em></li>\n<li><em>Apothecary</em></li>\n<li><em>Master Apothecary</em></li>\n<li><em>Apothecary-General</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When choosing a Career for a new character, you always start at the first level of the career — so, if you were an Apothecary, you would start as an Apprentice Apothecary. </p>\n<h3>Advancing Through Your Career</h3>\n<p>Your Character’s Career affects how they will grow through experience. Every Career offers three forms of Advances: Characteristic Advances, Skill Advances, and Talent Advances — each of which are purchased with Experience Points (XP). You can also use XP to Change Career. Your Career Level determines what Characteristics, Skills, and Talents are available to you.</p>\n<h4>Characteristic Advances</h4>\n<p>Every Career has an Advance Scheme governing its Characteristic Advances. The Advance Scheme shows your character’s 10 Characteristics, 3 marked with <strong>I</strong>, 1 marked with <strong>II</strong>, 1 marked with <strong>III</strong>, and the last marked with <strong>IV</strong>.</p>\n<p>The three marked <strong>I</strong> are Characteristics you can advance in the first level of the Career. When you enter the second level of a career, the <strong>II </strong>Characteristic also becomes available. When you enter the third level, the <strong>III </strong>Characteristic also becomes available. And when you enter the fourth and last level of a Career, the <strong>IV</strong> Characteristic finally becomes available.</p>\n<p>The cost in XP of a Characteristic Advance is shown by hovering over the advancement indicator (the plus symbol), and depends on the number of Characteristic Advances you have already taken in that Characteristic.</p>\n<p>Each Characteristic Advance adds +1 to the associated Characteristic. So, if you had purchased 4 Agility Advances, and your Initial Agility was 27, your Current Agility would be 31. The Advances would cost 25 XP per +1 Advance, as at each point the number of Advances previously taken would be in the 0–5 range.</p>\n<p>There is no upper limit to the number of Characteristic Advances that can be purchased, although higher levels do become prohibitively expensive. <strong>Note</strong>: While Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill have the word ‘Skill’ in them, this is only a historical artefact — they are characteristics and are Advanced as such.</p>\n<h4>Skill Advances</h4>\n<p>You can advance all the Skills listed for your Career level and lower. So, if you were an Apothecary’s Apprentice (level 1), you could only access the Skills listed under Apothecary’s Apprentice (level 1). But, if you were a Master Apothecary (level 3), you could access all the Skills for Master Apothecary (level 3), Apothecary (level 2), and Apprentice Apothecary (level 1).</p>\n<p>The cost in XP of a Skill Advance is shown by hovering over the advancement indicator and depends on the number of Skill Advances you have already taken in that Skill.</p>\n<p>Each Skill Advance adds +1 to your Skill level. Therefore, if you had purchased 9 Advances in Stealth and your Agility was 31, your Stealth would be 40. The first 5 Advances would cost 10 XP each, and the 4 remaining Advances would cost 15 XP each.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: One of the Skills in the first level of your Career will be marked in italics. This is the Skill you Test when @JournalEntry[uOqWtxfjRN3BfC2z]{Status} money. </p>\n<p>Like Characteristic Advances, there is no upper limit to the number of Skill Advances that can be purchased.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Non-Career Advances</em></h3>\n<p><em>Characters will inevitably want to advance Characteristics and Skills not listed in their Careers. That’s fine, if the GM feels it’s appropriate, but it costs double. The GM might want you to find a teacher or otherwise play out this unusual education. </em></p>\n<p><em>Non-Career Characteristic and Skill Advances cost double the amount of XP listed in the Characteristic and Skill Improvement XP Costs table.</em></p>\n<p><em>Normally, non-Career Talents may not be purchased with XP, although Training and Unusual Learning Endeavours in Chapter 6: Between Adventures provide an opportunity to purchase non-Career Advances as if they were Career Advances, and give the possibility of learning non-Career Talents.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Talent Advances</h4>\n<p>Talents are only available when you are in the level of the Career that lists them. So, if you are an Apothecary-General, you can only buy Talents listed under Apothecary-General, not those listed under Apprentice Apothecary, Apothecary, or Master Apothecary.</p>\n<p><strong>Talents Advances cost 100 XP +100 XP per Advance already taken in that Talent.</strong></p>\n<p>The first time you purchase a new Talent (for 100 XP) it grants you access to the Talent’s special rules. If you purchase a Talent multiple times (second time costs 200 XP, third 300 XP) any additional abilities bestowed are listed in the Talent description.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all Talents can be purchased multiple times. Check the Talent listing for any limitations.</p>\n<h3>Changing Career</h3>\n<p>When you have taken all the Advances you want in your current Career, it’s time to change Career. Changing Career means one of two things: </p>\n<p>1)<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Moving to a different level within your current Career (from Apothecary to Master Apothecary ); or</p>\n<p>2)<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Moving to an entirely new Career (from Apothecary to Scholar).</p>\n<p>In each case, you will have to first determine if you have completed your current Career level. If you have, changing Career costs 100 XP. If you have not, it costs 200 XP.</p>\n<h4>Completing a Career</h4>\n<p>Completing a Career represents mastering your current vocation and being ready to move on to something new. To complete a Career, you must have the number of Advances listed below in all your Career level’s Characteristics and in eight of your Career level’s available Skills. You must also have at least 1 Talent from your current Career level. Skills and Talents you have gained from advancement prior to entering your current Career count towards this..</p>\n<table style=\"height:109px;width:19.0642%\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">Level</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">Advances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Just because you have completed a Career level does not mean you have to move to a new one. Moving Career is always entirely up to you. If you wish to stay in the first level of Pauper forever, that’s completely fine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Customize Your Trappings</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Trappings listed in each Career are guidelines only. Feel free to be creative with your Trappings, choosing those that fit your interpretation of your character’s Career and how it manifests. So, if you were using the Soldier Career to represent a grizzled Handgunner from reikland’s State Army, you may decide to tweak the required Trappings to include powder and shot. </em></p>\n<p><em>Trappings are how you are recognised as someone belonging to your career. if you want to go incognito, you might not want to have all your trappings with you. Similarly, if you are trying to use the authority of your Career, not having the trappings of such means people might not take you seriously.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Changing to a New Level</h4>\n<p>If you have completed your current Career level, you can enter the next Career level, or any lower Career level, for 100 XP. So, if you completed Hunter (Hunter level 2), you could exit to Tracker (Hunter level 3) or Trapper (Hunter level 1) for 100 XP, but not Huntsmaster (Hunter level 4).</p>\n<p>With GM permission, you can also skip Career levels. This is normally driven by in-game events. For example: A Scion (Noble level 1) inherits a significant estate during play, so the GM offers Noble Lord (Noble level 4) as a potential change of Career. Like normal, changing to this Career level costs 100 XP if you have completed your current Career level, or 200 XP if you have not.</p>\n<h4>Changing to a New Career</h4>\n<p>If you have completed your current Career level, you can enter the first level of any Career from your Class for 100 XP, or for 200 XP if you have not completed your current Career level. If you want to enter the first level of a Career from a different Class, this cost an extra 100 XP. Note: your GM may require in-game justification for such Career changes; after all, not just anyone can enter Noble, even if you are in the Courtier Class.</p>\n<p>Further, if you have completed your current Career level, with GM permission, and solid justification, you can enter the same Career level in any Career within your Class. So, if you completed Master Apothecary (Apothecary level 3), you could move to Fellow (Scholar level 3), to show you were taking a teaching position in Altdorf University. This costs 100 XP. However, be aware there are obvious limitations here. Some Careers, such as Wizard, require the basics be learned before the more advanced lore can be understood and the Talents of earlier Career levels will not be open to you at a higher level.</p>\n<p>Lastly, between adventures, you can also change Career using the @JournalEntry[K49RF9UtI7w5i1lY]{Changing Career}.</p>\n<table style=\"height:80px;width:63.1536%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:39.1158%;text-align:center\"><strong>Improvement</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:116.2%;text-align:center\"><strong>XP Cost</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:39.1158%;text-align:center\">+1 Talent Advance </td>\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:116.2%;text-align:center\">100 XP + 100 XP Per time the Talent is already taken</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:39.1158%;text-align:center\">Leave a Complete Career</td>\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:116.2%;text-align:center\">100 XP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:39.1158%;text-align:center\">Leave an Incomplete Career</td>\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:116.2%;text-align:center\">200 XP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:39.1158%;text-align:center\">Enter a different Class</td>\n<td style=\"height:16px;width:116.2%;text-align:center\">+100 XP</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":"KBFMpqeeMFWhdpSI","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":200001}}}

{"_id":"FpGFvpumZzj40GSp","name":"The Stops (Sotturm to Middenheim)","content":"<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Sotturm</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sotturm is a small market town with ambitions. It has long been popular with Middenland’s guildmasters as a place to hold business negotiations: it is a neutral location with no allegiance to any town or city, and its location — on the highway and yet fairly out of the way — means that meetings do not attract too much attention. While the fare at The Tower coaching inn is of excellent quality, true epicures head for The Gilded Harpy: this marble building, with its grotesque yet undeniably masterful statue outside, would not look out of place in the wealthier quarters of Altdorf or Middenheim. Thanks to the wealthy guildmasters, who have bought estates around the town, it does a roaring trade at any time of year.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Malstedt</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At last, the oppressive forest opens up and the road winds upward through rolling hills. The Imperial Crown at Malstedt is large and welcoming, although its sign has recently been defaced: the gold crown has been painted over, and the head of a white wolf inexpertly added. Likewise, the emblem of Four Seasons Coaches by the door has been daubed over, and the staff no longer turn any coaches away. If asked about the changes, they say that there are some in Middenland who speak openly of seceding from the Empire and creating an Ulrican state in the north. But if pressed further, they claim that they do not know anything more, and hurry off to an urgent task elsewhere.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Grubentreich</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This smallish market town supports a number of local villages and farms. The main local products — the meat, milk, and cheese of sheep and goats that graze the surrounding hills — are on sale everywhere. The Bildhofen Arms is named after the area’s ruler, Duke Leopold, and boasts a goat cheese that is well regarded across Middenland and beyond.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Schoninghagen</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A brass plaque above a side-room at The Skull and Cross bears the inscription: ‘Here, in the Year of Sigmar 2369, was signed the Treaty of Schoninghagen, to the great glory of Middenland and the Todbringer Family. May Ulric and Sigmar protect them and bless their loyal subjects.’</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A <strong>Lore (History) Test </strong>— <strong>Challenging (+0)</strong> for native Middenlanders and <strong>Hard (–20) </strong>for everyone else — recalls that the treaty settled the details of Grand Duke Gunthar von Bildhofen’s abdication from Middenland, and established that the Baron of Nordland was to pay homage to the Graf of Middenheim. The inn’s staff proudly tell the tale, if any traveller inquires.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Middenheim</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The final leg of the journey is the shortest by distance, but can often take just as long as the others. All arrivals must go through certain formalities — mostly to do with the city’s new tax laws — and wait their turn to use one of the causeways or chair-lifts that run from the foot of the Ulricsberg to the city.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-c08afba2-7fff-8cca-727d-54ca6672e765\"> </span></p>","folder":"zhKNzx21YVsaN3CA","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"FzAv1GiKRUfZkTOH","name":"Thognar - The Clerk","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/thognar.webp\" width=\"331\" height=\"210\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[KZjUllCfHJl4kZ2F]{Thognar}</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">Clerk Thora is employed at the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission of Elf, Dwarf, and Halfling Interests}. She may be of interest to the Characters because she is one of the few individuals in Middenheim who is taking a proactive stance in opposing the introduction of the taxes by collecting signatures for her petition. She is also vehement in her opinion that the court minstrel, Rallane Lafarel, is to blame for the introduction of the taxes. She could be introduced into the campaign either to spur the Characters into action by pointing out the injustice of the taxes, or to mislead them by impugning the blameless Rallane.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">Thora is close to four and a half feet in height and has a medium build for a Dwarf. She has a thick thatch of plaited light brown hair. Her large eyes are a pale blue and she glares rather too intensely at whomever she is speaking with.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">Thora is rather surly and unlikeable even by Dwarf standards. She is brooding and concentrated when calm, loud and piping hot when roused. It's easy for her to find fault with folk, though she takes her job very seriously and tempers her attitudes towards those who seek her aid, and with members of Middenheim society who might be able to help.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">Behind the bluff exterior Thora is maudlin and lonesome. She feels that at her age she ought to have achieved more than assisting a Komission Convenor in Middenheim, and she feels she is leaving it a little late to start a family. She takes pride in her work, but she does not excel at it. Whilst she is industrious, such diligence is needed to compensate for her slowness and inaccuracy.</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>Clerk Thognar’s professional role is to receive anyone who arrives at the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission for Elf, Dwarf, and Halfling Interests} with an issue of concern to Middenheim’s Dwarf community. </p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Thognar is not a hypocrite, and is every bit as hardworking as he claims to be. He can be found at the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission} offices every day except Festag. He works from 8 in the morning until 7 at night. On Festags he spends the morning in the @JournalEntry[7wu8onhV4JEAuEfn]{Chapel of Grungni}. The rest of the time he splits between drinking in the Coppershiners tavern, or pottering about his @JournalEntry[y4MpfiD6PHBOAdX0]{Sudtor} home reviewing notes and reading. </p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Dwarfs have a bonus of +10 to any Fellowship Tests with Thognar. He is a little lonely, so female Dwarfs are subjected to mooning but coquettish fascination. </p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Thognar has little knowledge about the opinions and motives of the influencers at the Graf ’s court. He is not very perceptive and blinded by his prejudices. His superior, Convenor Magradil, shares his views, and the two of them spend a lot of time in conference where they reinforce each other’s perspectives. </p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Thognar does not really know who has the ear of the Graf, and is humble enough not to speculate on matters he doesn’t understand. The exception to this is that he is convinced Rallane possesses undue influence, and exercises it against Dwarf interests. </p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Thognar’s goals at this time are to organise a petition against the Dwarf tax, see the influence of Elves reduced at the Graf ’s court, and promote Dwarf interests in Middenheim.</p>\n<h2>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</h2>\n<p>Both literally and figuratively, Clerk Thognar is not a lofty member of Middenheim society (though to point this out would earn his resentment). Most of the characters from <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> have no interest in the concerns of the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission for Elf, Dwarf, and Halfling Interests}, and Thognar does not mix with high society outside of work. </p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: Until recently Thognar respected the Chancellor’s conservative approach but is deeply distressed by the introduction of the Dwarf tax. He is making up his mind whether to hate Sparsam, directing his anger at Rallane in the meantime.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: They have never met, but Thognar has heard of the good opinion Dieter has of Dwarfs, and acquaintances have shared anecdotes about the champion’s friendly behaviour and ability to hold his drink. The two attend the Festival of Fine Ales together during the course of the adventure, where Thognar attempts to persuade Dieter to sign his petition. If Dieter refuses due to being hypnotised, Thognar grows furious and may voice his opinion of Rallane.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: Rallane is the focus of Thognar’s bitterness. He is obsessed with the Elf and whilst he keeps his lips sealed when at work, he complains about the minstrel openly if he has had a drink. He believes that Rallane has a deep and long-held hatred of Dwarfs, resents them for their hard work, and has swayed the Graf against his better judgement. Thognar privately entertains thoughts that the Elf has woven spells into his songs that have weakened the resolve of the courtiers. If he is presented with evidence that hypnotism or drugs have been used to control people, he quickly blames Rallane, even concocting anecdotes and circumstantial evidence to support his suspicion.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: He has respect for her according to her station, but they have never interacted.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: No idea who she is.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Thognar has respect for Middenheim’s military, but no dealings with them.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Wizards are better integrated in Middenheim society than they are elsewhere in the Empire, and have a long history of constructive cooperation with the city’s military. As such, Thognar is respectful of the Wizards, though he does not know them personally.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Thognar is a little leery of the Ulrican cult; he has little time for Human gods and is dimly aware that Ar-Ulric has voiced his approval of the taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Dwarfs tend to find the whole notion of people employed for their ability to beguile and charm to be dishonourable. He has no time for Ladies at Court as a concept, though he has nothing against them personally.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: For some reason Thognar does not regard Allavandrel with the degree of malice that he does Rallane. This is an unconscious bias — Thognar has respect for Allavandrel’s skill in hunting and carousing. Forced to acknowledge this inconsistency, he would quickly decide that Allavandrel is in cahoots with @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane}, and equally deserving of opprobrium.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Thognar is acquainted with Gotthard thanks to a few functions at which various Komission staff have mingled. He affords Gotthard grudging respect, as the man is in a similar line of work and apparently successful. He is aware that Gotthard is pleased with the taxes, but cannot bring himself to dislike him for it. It is, after all, the fault of the Elves rather than the merchants.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: No idea who he is.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Thognar is bitterly disappointed by the three Law Lords, men he had previously respected. Convenor Magradil has been to see them since the introduction of the taxes and reports that Erlich has supported the taxes but doesn’t respond to any requests to explain himself, that Hoflich supports the taxes and is cold and indifferent when asked why, and that Wasmeier, whilst apparently against the taxes, is unwilling to oppose them in any serious manner.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal} – Chamberlain</strong>: Thognar imagines they have a nodding acquaintance thanks to his occasional visits to the palace, and respects Breugal’s obvious diligence. Breugal does not know who Thognar is.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>He attends a few Carnival events, mostly to talk with other Dwarfs and drum up support for his petition. He quickly leaves any space Rallane enters.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales} (8–11)</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Black Pool Illuminations} (9–11)</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants/Jousting} (2–5)</p>","folder":"hQfHL1VS2zKPRt1T","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":500000}}}

Many Old Gods stood as patrons to one of the tribes, and to this day some are still associated with the old geographical hunting grounds of those ancient peoples. Although few say so out loud, many citizens of the Empire regard the Old Gods as the true deities of the Empire, and the Classical Gods as relative newcomers.</p>\n<p>As time passed, five gods rose to prominence amongst the Old Gods, worshipped by dominant cults spread from one end of the Empire to the other: Ulric, Taal, Rhya, Manaan, and Morr, representing the primal spheres of war, nature, fertility, seas, and death.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Classical Gods</strong></h4>\n<p>The Classical Gods spread from the southern lands of Tilea, Estalia, and the Border Princes through trade and diplomatic contact. Today, their worship is popular in the cosmopolitan towns and cities, and some nobles and townsfolk secretly regard them as more sophisticated than the Old Gods — though few would risk voicing such opinions aloud!</p>\n<p>The most widespread cults of Classical Gods in the Empire are dedicated to Verena, Myrmidia, Shallya, and Ranald, patrons of wisdom, strategy, mercy, and trickery. Hiding behind these, there is also Khaine, the God of Murder, though his cult is outlawed in most places.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Provincial Gods</strong></h4>\n<p>The Empire hosts a wide variety of deities — patrons of provinces, towns, forests, lakes, rivers, crafts, and much more besides. Formed into complicated pantheons by local legends and myths, the Provincial Gods often have small cults dedicated to them, but few have much influence. However, there are exceptions: standing high above other Provincial Gods, worship of Handrich, the God of Trade, has spread significantly with commerce and now boasts a significant cult-presence amongst the Empire’s rising merchant class.</p>\n<h4><strong>Sigmar</strong></h4>\n<p>Sigmar founded the Empire over two-thousand years ago, and his legend recounts how he conquered unthinkable foes and overcame impossible odds. Reigning for fifty years, he eventually abdicated and turned east to return his magical warhammer, Ghal-Maraz, to its forgers: his old allies, the Dwarfs. He was never seen again. Not long after, oracles and prophets claimed Sigmar had ascended to godhood, invested by Ulric before the entire pantheon of old gods and new.</p>\n<p>Today, many centuries later, the cult of Sigmar, patron of the Empire, has spread to such an extent that its leader, the Grand Theogonist, is arguably more powerful than the emperor himself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Gods of the Reikland</strong></em></p>\n<table style=\"height:115px;width:573px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:34px\"><em>Bögenauer</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:34px\"><em>River Bögen</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:34px\"><em>Boatmen, Merchants, and Bögenhafeners</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:34px\"><em>Coins, sheaves of reeds, rolled stones</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:34px\"><em>A single temple in Bögenhafen with no full-time clerics; shrines line the river.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:17px\"><em>Borchbach</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:17px\"><em>Rhetoric</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:17px\"><em>Agitators, politicians, lawyers</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:17px\"><em>Written speeches, acorns, quills</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:17px\"><em>Several shrines and two temples to Borchbach are found in Altdorf.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:13px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:13px\"><em>Clio</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:13px\"><em>History</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:13px\"><em>Scholars</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:13px\"><em>Fruit, honey, menses</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:13px\"><em>A significant temple to the Classical God Clio is attached to Altdorf University.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:17px\"><em>Dyrath</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:17px\"><em>Women</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:17px\"><em>Womenfolk</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:17px\"><em>Beer, eels, silver</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:17px\"><em>Dyrath has no temples; instead, a secretive cult is spread through the villages and hamlets of the Hägercrybs.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:17px\"><em>Grandfather Reik</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:17px\"><em>River Reik</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:17px\"><em>Merchants, bargees, fishermen</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:17px\"><em>Coins, jewellery, clothing</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:17px\"><em>Shrines dot the length of the river Reik, but there is no formal cult.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:74px;height:17px\"><em>Katya</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63px;height:17px\"><em>Disarming Beauty</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:91px;height:17px\"><em>Bawds, lovers, the lonely</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:130px;height:17px\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width:199px;height:17px\"><em>Temples to Katya double as brothels in the towns of the Vorbergland.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Other Pantheons</strong></h3>\n<p>The different countries and species of the Old World all have deities of their own. Some, according to theologians, are aspects of other deities worshipped under different names. Others are particularly revered by a particular species: examples include Grungni, the Dwarfen God of Mining and Dwarf Pride; Isha, a Goddess of Fertility and Nature who is seen as the mother of all Elves; and Esmerelda, the Halfling Goddess of Hearth, Home, and Family.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Chaos Gods</strong></h3>\n<p>The Daemonic gods of the Realms of Chaos are the greatest threat to the Old World, each determined to bring absolute ruin to the mortal realm. Their worship by lost and damned souls is pervasive and clandestine, with uncounted dark cultists infiltrating all levels of society. Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and Slaanesh: Gods of Rage, Despair, Ambition, and Excess. Few dare whisper their twisting names, for they harbour malevolent power, and leave mutation and horror in their wake.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Cults</strong></h2>\n<h4><strong>Orders</strong></h4>\n<p>Most Old World cults are split into orders, with each order focussing on different aspects of their god’s concerns. Orders come in many different forms, including monastic orders of monks or nuns, templar orders of knights, priestly orders that attend to holy needs in the community, and mendicant orders of friars that wander the Old World, usually subsisting from alms. Each order is organised differently according to individual cult law and tradition, but in all cases they swear allegiance to the head of their cult, not the local nobility.</p>\n<h4><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h4>\n<p>The cults maintain holy sites across the Old World, many of them associated with legendary deeds of the gods from mythical times. Most are protected by buildings such as temples, abbeys, chapterhouses, or monasteries. Some older sites, or those not so well known, may only be marked by a shrine or unattended chapel. Cult buildings are usually decorated beautifully inside and out with scenes from the religion’s mythology. They vary widely in size and layout and often follow regional styles of architecture. Some hold extreme wealth, especially in the towns and cities where a more affluent population provides greater tithes. Larger cult buildings support dozens of people, including lay craftspeople, guards, and servants, while smaller sites are run by a handful of staff aided by volunteers from the community. In villages, a single priest is the norm, supported by the faithful.</p>\n<p>Shrines and chapels are more modest affairs, the size of a one-room house or smaller. They do not normally have a full-time priest, although they may come under the charge of a nearby temple or — especially in rural areas — a wandering priest who travels from one village and shrine to another. In a priest’s absence, local villagers pray unsupervised, leave small offerings, and keep the shrine in good repair.</p>\n<h3><strong>Primary Cults of the Empire</strong></h3>\n<p>Although many hundreds of gods are worshipped across the Empire, ten are of particular importance, each worshipped by cults spanning the grand provinces and granted a special position by Magnus the Pious over two-hundred years ago.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Grand Conclave</strong></h3>\n<p>When Emperor Magnus the Pious rebuilt the Empire after the Great War Against Chaos, he realised previous schisms and civil wars besetting his realm were often sourced in religious unrest. </p>\n<p>To help prevent this happening again, Magnus created the Grand Conclave, a meeting of the primary cults in the Empire held every five years to air grievances and discuss resolutions, with the emperor sitting as chair.</p>\n<p>Though enormously controversial at the time, the Grand Conclave is now fully accepted, and is held alongside great celebrations and festivities, with the representatives of the following gods required to attend: Manaan, Morr, Myrmidia, Ranald, Rhya, Shallya, Sigmar, Taal, Ulric, and Verena. Although other influential cults exist — such as the Cult of Handrich, which is currently lobbying for a seat on the Conclave — the ten currently sitting are widely perceived as the most important in the Empire.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[5KE7OsW9A3UTErwU]{The Cult of Manann, God of the Sea}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[npoAggEl7Nf760vE]{The Cult of Morr, God of Death}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[p9mLWL5dhvve4nQO]{The Cult of Myrmidia, Goddes of Strategy}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[NFzckQwGMWvvhEUy]{The Cult of Ranald, God of Trickery}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[2IwaKatBpKLgtBYJ]{The Cult of Rhya, Goddess of Fertility}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[5UVBumUG1gBLetDB]{The Cult of Shallya, Goddess of Mercy}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[e29H7Woyzy1zoeQ1]{The Cult of Sigmar, God of the Empire}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[yUbmjj9uSiWR40j4]{The Cult of Taal, God of the Wild}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[LQ2w4wBqLqxjQxsh]{The Cult of Ulric, God of War}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[mJCVmgr24GVA4b1p]{The Cult of Verena, Goddess of Wisdom}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Dwarven Ancestor Gods</h2>\n<p>The Dwarfs venerate their ancient ancestors, valuing tradition above all else. Though the Time of the Ancestor Gods was many thousands of years ago, the Dwarfs still hold records of that time in their oldest Holds. Many names echo from that era, creating a broad, inter-related pantheon, but three Ancestor Gods are of especial importance and are known by all Dwarfs: Grimnir, Grungni, and Valaya, each a progenitor of the species as a whole. In addition to the oldest Ancestor Gods, Dwarfs also revere the founders of local clans as guardian deities.</p>\n<h3>Dwarf Priests</h3>\n<p>Those dedicating themselves to the cults of the Ancestor Gods do not use the Priest, Nun, or Warrior Priest Careers, as Dwarfs have a very different relationship with their gods, seeking to emulate them rather than worship or appease them. </p>\n<p>Because of this, if you wish to play a Dwarf dedicated to one of the Ancestor Gods, simply choose an appropriate career to best act like that god. So, if you wanted to emulate Grimnir, effectively becoming a priest of Grimnir, perhaps play a Slayer and join the Cult of the Slayer, or maybe become a Soldier.</p>\n<h2>Elven Gods</h2>\n<p>The Elves worshipped their own gods long before Humans and most other species existed in their current forms. Their pantheon is extensive, with different groups of deities being held as important by Wood Elves and High Elves. </p>\n<p>Loosely, there are two groups of gods, the Cadai and the Cytharai. The Cadai rule the heavens, and have strong connections to their Elven worshippers, directly helping where they can. The selfish Cytharai rule the underworld, and care little for the Elves. Standing apart from both these courts are a loose group of unaligned gods, the most prominent being Morai-Heg the Crone, Goddess of Fate and Death.</p>\n<p>The High Elves especially revere the Cadai, and have sophisticated priesthoods dedicated to their teachings. They appease the Cytharai when necessary, but it is unlawful to worship any but Mathlann, whose aid is sought by mariners. According to their myths, Asuryan, the God of Creation, is king of all the gods, able to pronounce judgement upon them all.</p>\n<p>The Wood Elves take a much more balanced approach and have temples and shrines to all the gods impacting their lives, be they Cadai or Cytharai. Because of their close association with the woods and forests, they revere Isha the Mother and Kurnous the Hunter above all others, and rumours persist that both gods take a direct hand in Wood Elf affairs.</p>\n<p>According to some theologians — mostly Elven — the deities of this pantheon are the true gods, and those worshipped by other species are simply different aspects of the Elven originals.</p>\n<h3>Elven Priests</h3>\n<p>Both High Elves and Wood Elves have priesthoods for the gods, but they do not have blessings and miracles. The Elves don’t believe the gods manifest in this fashion, and instead see magic as a gift from the gods. Because of this, if you wish to be an Elven priest, use the Wizard career, and chose from an appropriate Lore to represent the magic your god has gifted. So, a ‘priest’ of Kurnous would use the Lore of Beasts, a worshipper of Isha, the Lore of Life, and devotees of Asuryan use the Lores of Light or Fire.</p>\n<h2>Halfling Gods</h2>\n<p>Some say that Halflings are superstitious rather than religious, and the bulk of their deities support this impression. Most Halfling gods and goddesses have to do with hearth and home, cooking, herb lore, earthy matters, and general day-to-day concerns. Halfling gods are practical rather than philosophical: as the saying goes: ‘Deep thoughts butter no parsnips’. Halflings also show respect to certain Human deities — Sigmar, Taal, and Rhya in particular — but this is more from a desire to avoid conflict than from any sincere devotion.</p>\n<h3>Halfling Priests</h3>\n<p>Halflings don’t really have priests, and they certainly don’t build temples (though Humans seem happy to do it for them, especially Sigmarites). There are better things to do than warble on about someone else’s business. Of course, they respect the gods, and have shrines on-hand should they need to have a quick natter, but none make a career exclusively talking to just one god — why make yourself so exclusive? Should a particular god need to be appeased, it is usually left up to a local elder to do what’s required on behalf of the community, often after a great deal of talking with relevant experts and peers.</p>\n<h2>Chaos Gods</h2>\n<p>The Ruinous Powers of Chaos are the foremost existential threat to the Old World, but much about them remains a mystery. Merely seeking such knowledge is punishable by death without permission from the Cult of Sigmar. And seeking such permission attracts intense scrutiny of your person and motives, and is seldom granted.</p>\n<p>The Ruinous Powers are seen by the common folk as the punishing manifestation of sin, and the reason that all must behave within socially acceptable boundaries as espoused by the cults. Indulging in violence, lust, slovenliness or unseemly curiosity has direct repercussions for the individual (as they are corrupted and come to a sticky end) and for their community, as their deviant behaviour attracts the destructive attention of these evil forces. </p>\n<p>The average person will know of the most powerful of these forces through euphemistic names, such as the Blood God, the Plague Lord, the Lord of Change, and the Prince of Pain. Even the most learned scholars of this forbidden lore can only guess at what motivates these obscene powers, or if they even have an agenda beyond their primal impulses. </p>\n<p>It seems there are competing factions dedicated to different aspects of ruin, and they are as much enemies to each other as to the rest of the Old World. On the rare occasions when they co-operate, much like they did during the Great War Against Chaos over two-hundred years ago, the world trembles. Some claim cults dedicated to the Chaos Gods have infiltrated the Empire. Most dismiss this as nonsense, for no right-thinking individual would be so foolish as to worship one of the Ruinous Powers.</p>","folder":"NkiXlTQtgNkW3FMs","sort":1300001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":1300001}}}

{"_id":"GB84Qjm9NFUsPR4W","name":"Concluding the Adventure","content":"<p>This adventure can end in one of three ways: with @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} dead, captured, or escaped. For the continuity of the ‘Gravelord’ adventures (which continue in <strong>The Horned Rat Companion</strong>) the third outcome is desirable, but if it cannot happen without blatantly fudging the game, there are other options.</p>\n<h3>Gräber Escaped</h3>\n<p>If his escape plan succeeds, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} can make a getaway into the woods while the Beastman Skeletons hamper any pursuit. By the time the Characters free themselves and try to follow, he has a good head start, and the GM can help him make good his escape by having a sudden thunderstorm wash away any tracks.</p>\n<p>The Characters trudge back to the village, soaked to the bone by the time they arrive, and report on what has happened. The cave can be cleared of its bones and blessed by a wandering priest of Morr, the skulls destroyed, and the harvest can begin — with everyone keeping one eye over their shoulder for any further threats — as the party resume their interrupted journey.</p>\n<h3>Gräber Captured</h3>\n<p>Capture will not dampen @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} spirits at all, and he will keep up a steady flow of invective and grandiose threats until the Characters decide to silence him.</p>\n<p>The road wardens summoned by Hedric the coachman — or perhaps a witch hunter, brought to the village by the spreading news of a necromantic threat in the area — arrive just as the Characters conduct their bound captive to the village. Several villagers recognise him, and if the Characters have not yet heard the story of his prior humiliation, this is a good opportunity to fill in any blanks.</p>\n<p>The Characters resume their journey to Middenheim with the thanks of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock’s} villagers. Along the way they pass a huddle of corpses by the roadside, and they recognise the road wardens or the witch hunter’s band, just as the bodies rise up as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies} and attack. A moment before combat begins, a familiar, whining voice rings out from the brush beyond the road.<em> ‘You cannot defeat the Gravelord! Now you pay, foolish mortals!’ </em>By the time any of the Characters fights clear of the Zombies and tries to pursue, Gräber has gone.</p>\n<h3>Gräber Dead</h3>\n<p>Given that this adventure is part of an ongoing series, it may seem like a bad outcome to have Gräber killed. But death is not the end of the world, and certainly not the end of the Gravelord! There are various ways to ensure that he returns in future adventures.</p>\n<p><strong>Fate Points</strong>: Player Characters need not be the only ones with a destiny. Although giving Fate Points to NPCs and monsters is not generally encouraged, a recurring nemesis character is a good exception to make. If Gräber is killed and left for dead, he invokes the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.01PN4MXAyw3mxvZl]{Die Another Day} option and manages to escape while no one is looking — or he simply revives sufficiently to be captured.</p>\n<p><strong>Undying Hatred</strong>: His body may lie mangled and bleeding, but thanks to the dramatic circumstances or some previously unknown necromantic magic, the vengeful spirit of the Gravelord lives on. He becomes a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.GgSxlomoV220kd3G]{Ghost} or a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.hMbcLVjk7eUdxtqC]{Cairn Wraith} — or perhaps, to his baffled embarrassment, the first recorded male @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.TWy5l4uYTRAtjfit]{Tomb Banshee}, as befits his voice — and continues to harass the Characters with unexpected hit-and-run attacks. At the GM’s option, he retains his spellcasting abilities, and he is not @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.D0ImWEIMSDgElsnl]{Unstable} as long as he pursues his vengeance with his normal single-minded determination.</p>\n<p><strong>Body Thief</strong>: Instead of becoming a disembodied spirit — or perhaps in addition to it — @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} has the ability to possess a living body by winning an Opposed Willpower Test. This need not be one of the Characters, or even a humanoid creature — he might jump to the body of a nearby squirrel or rabbit, or even take over poor Seel or @Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder} as they come to explore the cave the following day.

It will cost a person a crown to get into the Red Tent- but once in, all drinks, food and entertainments are free thereafter.  It is simply a tented version of a Middenlander Drinking Hall- with long rows of tables and well heeled well presented drinkers left to find a seat and listen to a range of trumpet bands and folk singers perform great sing-alongs.  Formally known as the Hoffmeisters tent, it prides itself on a range of lagers and ales, all brewed under the Hoffmeisters banner from across the empire.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Item[OYc5gurKADCpQY7a]{Wolf Fang Mead, Pint}      </li>\n<li>@Item[za9GWWBNqtU4Q1bs]{Stilburg Dragon Ale, Pint}        </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The White Tent</h2>\n<p>Slightly smaller than the red tent but much noisier, the White tent (so called because of its creamy canvas covering) is much cheaper to enter- it only costs a shilling to get in.  The drinks however also cost (not much a few pence) but are served in extra large sterns.  Music is free but food is sold by various caterers including one unique one- Master Nabar’s White Sausage Stall.  Nabar, one of the Butcher’s Guild, spends all year making his infamous white sausages- a rare spicy delicacy containing a range of succulent meats and spiced wonderfully (its rather hot).  Sir Eber Veit swears blind it’s “The best sausage in the Empire” and this plus the other stalls are always busy.  The entertainments tend to be slightly more bawdy, the songs a little ruder and it’s not unknown for there to be fights.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Item[VxEcqZNBXNPQD3jw]{Master Nabar’s White Sausages}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Green Tent</h2>\n<p>A majestic tent, made of green thick canvas and covered in ornate patterns showing rural scenes, the Green Tent is a smaller big top (holds 350 as opposed to the Red tents vast 500), and a much more cosy atmosphere.  The license for the tent belongs to the Halfling Elders council of the City and within that community it is known as the Cousins Tent- mostly because in the months beforehand the various Halflings vie to get “Their cousins back home” to get the concession to come work the tent.  What you get then is a well ran Halfling controlled tent, famed for its hearty meals and decent ciders.  Indeed some have pointed out that due to the filling nature of the food, and the deceptively strong nature of Halfling brewed cider, many who go to this tent get famously drunk.  Inside it is warm, cosy, and much gentler on the senses and it tends to be beloved by families.  Certainly this is the only tent that provides entertainments for children and the whole thing is busy from dawn to dusk.  It is a single crown to get in, and while alcohol and food do cost more they are considerably cheaper prices than is found elsewhere.</p>\n<p>It is also noted that the reason why the city’s Halfling community like the Green tent so well is because it provides work for their cousins and in laws- while allowing them continue to run THEIR businesses all eight days of carnival.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Item[cwozUSQ3DPAabR9c]{Moot Cider, Pint}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Yokel Tent</h2>\n<p>A wild rainbow coloured tent, the Yokel tent is one staffed entirely by non residents.  Indeed it specialises in the best beers of Stirland, Tabacland and Ostermark and is often called the Ost Tent by those non residents to the city.  It is an old fashioned tent, filled with songs from the east, and catering to vistors from that region also (you even get a few Sylvanian beers served here).  It’s generally reckoned to be a nice safe place for outsiders to drink in but few Middenheimers even bother</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Item[7kwLVSEJdi3dxw2N]{Talabheim Special Ale, Pint}</li>\n<li>@Item[KGDpc28E8pVOuNGg]{Ostland Vodka, Glass}</li>\n<li>@Item[foB4IvXSPdckl8v8]{Bylorhof Stout, Pint}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Wolf &amp; Fish tent</h2>\n<p>A pale blue and white tent this was originally covered in sigils of the Ulrican church and the canvas has been in use for centuries without fail.  If it has been ripped the patches have increasingly used Manannian symbols and thus you get the Wolf and Fish designs which cover it.  This tent’s links with Manann grew about twenty years ago when the rights to the tent were bought by the Marienburg directorate merchant house, the House of Den Euwe.</p>\n<p>Under Den Euwe control it has become a home away from home for Wastelanders, serving Marienburgese ales and pale beers, with acts shipped down from Marienburg for the occasion.  While it costs a crown to enter each day, the atmosphere is fun and relaxed.  Alone of all the tents it allows patrons smoke (leading to it being called the Pipe Smokers tent), and food and drink is quite cheap.  Again, like the yokel tent, it is not one Middenheimers tend to frequent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Item[Vkzp9KLUGUJfej7z]{Marienburg Pale Ale, Pint}</li>\n<li>@Item[AslgD1D6mn0Gjf6L]{King's Gold Wheat Beer, Pint}</li>\n</ul>","folder":"lUyL3SvOXg2BFpv2","sort":268750,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"Ge7BuImLEwzDFhnp","name":"Criminal Coinage","content":"<p>Of course, if there is money involved there will be folk looking to take any advantage they can, including criminal options. For the Rogues in your party, two schemes concerning coins are worth knowing.</p>\n<h4>Counterfeiting</h4>\n<p>The diversity of coinage circulating the Empire means counterfeiting is rife. Reiklanders may be accustomed to seeing coins from other provinces, but are always wary of being scammed. A successful Evaluate Test will detect counterfeit coins, typically by inspecting coins for weight and hardness.</p>\n<p>Actually producing counterfeit coins is much harder. It requires an Art (Engraving) Test to carve a convincing stamping die, then a Trade (Blacksmith) Test to strike the coins, usually with the aid of an assistant. Including a higher precious metal content makes Evaluate Tests to detect counterfeits more difficult; using less than a fifth makes it much easier to spot the fake coins.</p>\n<h4>Clipping</h4>\n<p>Embezzlers can trim slivers of precious metal away from the edges of coins. This scam is called ‘clipping’ or ‘shaving’ and is practised mainly by shopkeepers or tollkeepers who have access to large quantities of other peoples’ money. Gold and silver filings are then melted down and sold to jewellers, counterfeiters, or fences. Clipped coins can be detected with the Evaluate Skill; the more of the coin that’s clipped, the easier the Test.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>The Nuln Standard</em></h3>\n<p><em>Altdorf may be the current capital of Reikland and the Empire, but coinage standards are established in the city-state of Nuln to the south. Historically, Nuln was the Empire’s capital until House Holswig-Schliestein restored the throne to Altdorf a century ago, and many imperial institutions still call that city home. The Nuln Standard only governs coin weight and metallurgy, not stamp imagery, which varies significantly across the provinces.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"1salsrflGffgtAKj","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Money"}}}

Tight alleys and winding streets appear and disappear from month to month.</p>\n<p>The eastern streets of the district are home to most of Altdorf&rsquo;s poorer Halflings, who lack the influence and connections of their Haffenstadt relations. These are the under-cooks and downtrodden servants, the unlucky rogues and the overlooked potboys. Making the situation worse is the domineering presence of Lefra and Ambur Lowhaven, a Halfling couple who effectively rule the community. Their power comes from intimidation and blackmail. Thanks to a network of terrified gossips, Lefra knows every Halfling&rsquo;s secrets, while Ambur has a key to every home. They even have Human families under their thumb.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pendersen Brewery</li>\n<li>Sanatorium of Mercy</li>\n<li>The Bronze Apple</li>\n<li>The Blackfire Chapel</li>\n</ul>"}

{"_id":"HNZ1m5jq3bUqTFA9","name":"Character Creation","content":"<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:</strong> <em>The entire character creation process can be done through the `/char` command.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Players explore the Old World through the eyes of their Character. This chapter shows you how to make your own Character from scratch. Most begin the game as unremarkable inhabitants of the Empire &mdash; possibly destined for greatness, but no-one would guess it. That&rsquo;s not to say you can&rsquo;t rise from humble origins, just that you&rsquo;ve got a long journey ahead, and that you&rsquo;ll probably need a better pair of boots.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All the information describing your Character&rsquo;s abilities is recorded on a Character Sheet. We provide ready-made Characters and sheets in the <strong>WFRP Starter Set</strong>, and online at cubicle7.co.uk. Using ready-made Characters is a great way to start playing and find out how the game works, but sooner or later you&rsquo;ll want to create your own from the ground up.</p>\n<p>When deciding what your Character will be like, discuss the kind of group you want to create with the other players. This makes sure that the group&rsquo;s Characters complement each other and that together you will have a broad and versatile range of abilities. Your GM may also have a particular kind of game in mind, and you&rsquo;ll need to make sure you have the right mix of Characters. Perhaps the GM plans for you to join a group of apprentice wizards who know one another at the Colleges of Magic? Maybe you are part of a unit of soldiers who have all deserted? Or maybe you are one of a disparate band of Reiklanders press-ganged into service by a powerful noble? Knowing this is important to help you build a suitable character which will be more fun to play.</p>\n<h3>Creating a Character</h3>\n<p>In some sections, you can either choose an option or accept the result of a dice roll to make the choice for you. You may receive bonus Experience Points (XP) for choosing to accept random&nbsp;outcomes, as if the Dark Gods of Chaos themselves applaud your acceptance of random chance. XP represent learning from experience and are the principal way to improve your abilities &mdash; you will be able to spend these points to enhance your character&rsquo;s abilities. XP are covered in more detail in @JournalEntry[Advancement].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Class and Career</h2>\n<p>Your Class determines your general place in society. Your Career describes your current job and determines your Status, which also influences how much money you earn.</p>\n<p>You can simply choose your Class and Career from the options below, write them down on your Character Sheet and move on to step 3. Alternatively, if you are unsure which to choose, or just want to randomly select for bonus XP:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Roll 1d100 on the @Table[career]{Random Class and Career Table}. If you don&rsquo;t like the result, move to step 2. If you keep the result, gain +50 XP.</li>\n<li>Roll twice more on the table, bringing your total to 3 choices. If one of the three now suits you, select one and gain +25 XP. If not, move to Step 3.</li>\n<li>Choose your Class and Career, or keep rerolling on the table until you get something you like. There is no XP bonus for this.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Class</h3>\n<p>Your choice of Class determines from which Careers you can choose. The Careers under each Class are of a broadly equivalent social level that offer similar types of opportunities between adventures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Academics</strong>: Learned people who use their education to make a living. Often, Academics are the only characters who can read and write.

Attributes include Movement, ten Characteristics, Wounds, Fate, and Resilience.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Wait! That's Not Fair!</em></h3>\n<p><em>You may notice that not all characters are created equal. An Elf has significant Characteristic advantages, for example. Don&rsquo;t be deceived by numbers alone, there are many aspects to character generation and all the Species have advantages and disadvantages at each stage, some of them not always obvious.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>CHARACTERISTICS</h3>\n<p>Your ten Characteristics are used in Tests, to determine if you perform an action successfully. The Human average for these Attributes is 30. Those who are gifted, or well-practiced, may achieve scores of over 40; only the most dedicated and experienced will achieve scores over 60. Of course, other Species have their own strengths and weaknesses, so their averages are different, sometimes significantly so.</p>\n<p>Determining Characteristics</p>\n<p>When determining your Characteristics:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Step 1) Roll 2d10 for each of the ten Characteristics and make a note of the results. If you feel your Character would be improved if you swapped round some of the dice roll results between Characteristics, move to the next step. If you stick with your random results, add the die rolls to the modifier for each Characteristic from the Attribute Table, write them on your Character Sheet and gain +50 XP.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Step 2) Rearrange the ten numbers rolled under step 1, assigning each to a different Characteristic (and adding its modifier). If you&rsquo;re happy with this new mix, record them on your Character Sheet and gain +25 XP. If not, move to the next step.</p>\n<p>Step 3) If you&rsquo;re still not happy with your results, either roll again and swap the rolls around with no XP bonus, or you could ignore the dice completely! Instead, allocate 100 points across the 10 Characteristics as you prefer, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 18 allocated to any single Characteristic. Add the modifiers from the Attribute Table and record them on your Character Sheet. Like rolling again, there is no XP bonus for this option.</p>\n<p>Weapon Skill (WS)</p>\n<p>Your skill at fighting hand-to-hand, your ability to land a measured blow, and effectiveness in the free-for-all of a massed melee. It is also used for unarmed combat, where your body is the weapon!</p>","folder":"Q0UfttGS2ZpKyqfG","sort":500001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Character"}}}

In that time, I have been attacked thrice, robbed twice, offered partnerships four times, and ignored by soldiers twice. I have also hidden from war parties six times, Human and otherwise, and fled those who would do me harm more times than I can count. Not once have I met someone who offered me a smile and a kind word without an ulterior motive. Everyone here has his own plan and will happily lie, cheat, steal, flatter, cajole, and murder to get it.</p>\n<p>How do people live like this?</p>\n<p>When not faced with other people, I have found the mountains bleak but not altogether unpleasant. The peaks are austere, stripped clean of plants and dirt by the ever-present wind, and the rock is good granite, strong and sturdy and sharp-edged. The sky is clear most days, a piercing blue broken only by the sun, and I would be sweltering in my leathers if not for the bracing wind. The footing is firm, the cliffs and ledges solid, and many small clearings exist for the nightly fire I must have to drive away the chill that settles in once the sun falls below the horizon. A man could be content walking these mountains all his life, admiring the rough beauty of the land here and the broad expanse stretching away below.</p>\n<p>Yet I am not here to be swayed by landscape, nor to cut myself off from the world. I am here seeking treasure, and my satisfaction or frustration can only be measured by my success in that endeavour.</p>\n<p>And thus far, I am most frustrated.</p>\n<p>I have not seen a single structure since I climbed the pass&mdash;no ruins, no chiselled stones, no remnants of door or wall or roof. Beyond the pass itself, I have found no trace that people have walked these peaks.</p>\n<p>Yet I know it must be here!</p>\n<p>My source claimed the tomb was within these mountains. That is why it had never been plundered, he said, because it is high above the reach of most thieves. They dig through the Borderlands, unearthing minor barrows and crypts, but the greatest tombs were fashioned here among the cliffs, where they could rest undisturbed for all eternity.</p>\n<p>Well, I mean to disturb them plenty.</p>\n<h2>Journal entry, day 50</h2>\n<p>When I awoke this morning it was with every intention of surrender. After more than two weeks here, climbing like some foolish goat from peak to peak, I have discovered nothing more valuable than a few chunks of granite. My source was either mistaken or deliberately false, and I have wasted time and valuable resources on a fool&rsquo;s errand. I will not compound my error further. Instead I will set out toward the pass again and descend from there to what the locals laughably refer to as civilisation. From there I can take a boat back up river and leave this desolate land behind me once and for all.</p>\n<p>Such was my intent. But plans never go as intended, and oft times that is for the best.</p>\n<p>As I clambered up yet another peak, seeking a view of the pass that I might orient myself, I spied something else instead. A flash of dull white, almost blinding in the glare of the rising sun and clearly visible against the dark granite. What could that be, I wondered? Ignoring caution, for after so many close calls here I have grown almost foolhardy to the notion of danger, I slid down the peak and moved as quickly as possible along an intervening ledge.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later, I was peering down into a tiny valley, really little more than a gash in the rock. And I was glad I had not given in to my first impulse to slide down there without first studying what might wait at the bottom.</p>\n<p>What I saw curdled my blood and froze my feet in place. My limbs felt heavy, my breath hot, and I could feel the sweat springing from my forehead to stream over my unblinking eyes. I might have screamed if my tongue had not turned to stone and my mouth filled with dust.</p>\n<p>Below me stood men.</p>\n<p>At least, those who had once been men.</p>\n<p>Now they were little more than bones, held together by some arcane art, yet still moving. It had been one of those bones, the flesh long since picked away, that I had seen from my previous perch. These were mere Skeletons, yet they walked&mdash;no, they marched&mdash;as I had seen soldiers do all too recently.</p>\n<p>And each Skeleton bore arms&mdash;swords and spears, with wicked blades, their edges untarnished. Several of the walking bones also carried helmets, breastplates, bracers, even greaves. It was as if a military patrol had been stripped of flesh without realizing it, and so they marched on, unaware of their own demise.</p>\n<p>I would have run, if I could. I would have stumbled backward on that ledge, until I was hidden from view, and then fled from that horrible sight, going anywhere as long as it was away. I could feel my sanity slipping as I gazed again upon these creatures, these mockeries of life. Yet, fear froze me, and I could not turn away.</p>\n<p>And for that I am forever grateful.</p>\n<p>For as I stared, I noticed something I had missed in my initial terror. The arms, the armour, they bore markings I had seen before. The style of the weapons, the materials used, the shape of the buckles holding greaves and bracers and breastplates in place&mdash;all these were familiar. I had seen them in paintings and on scrolls.</p>\n<p>They were the gear of Nehekharan soldiers.</p>\n<p>And if these monstrosities were Nehekharan, that could only mean one thing.</p>\n<p>The tomb I sought was nearby.</p>\n<h2>Journal entry, day 55</h2>\n<p>It was five days ago that I first sighted the walking dead. The fact that I can write that phrase with only a tiny shudder shows how numbed I have become to their horror.</p>\n<p>In that time, I have been careful to remain hidden from their patrols. I have watched, half-buried by loose rock, as the Skeletons marched past. I have lain beneath dirt and stone, while the creatures passed so close I could make out the hieroglyphs etched into their armour. If they breathed, I would have heard the rasp of their breath mere feet from my hiding places. Fortunately, these creatures seem less alert than their living counterparts&mdash;they have no noses, no ears, no eyes, after all, and while they are visibly alert to movement, they do not notice the subtle signs of my presence a living scout might have seen. Their empty sockets have scanned past my concealment many times, but not once have they paused.</p>\n<p>And for that I count myself among the luckiest of men.</p>\n<p>Two days ago, I saw others who were not so lucky. Three men were leading two donkeys laden with wares. Why they had forsaken the pass I do not know&mdash;perhaps it was to avoid the bandits who sometimes roam there. If so, they would have been safer with such thieves. The Skeleton Soldiers heard their approach, as did I, for in truth they made little attempt at stealth. The Undead turned as one and marched toward the sound, weapons raised. I crept behind, hoping they would not turn back, and indeed they did not, for the monsters were wholly occupied with their mission. They fell upon those travellers without a sound&mdash;no shouts, no curses, no bellows&mdash;only the dull clank of bone against metal.</p>\n<p>One of the travellers looked up and saw the Skeletons before they struck. He screamed and fell back against the lead donkey, scrabbling for the sword at his side, but the Undead were upon him before he could draw. A bronze axe rose and fell, lodging itself in the man&rsquo;s shoulder and chest, and he collapsed in a gush of blood.</p>\n<p>The bloodletting seemed to rouse something in the walking dead, and the ferocity of their attacks increased. They surrounded the travellers, blades stabbing and slicing and chopping, and before I could do more than crouch behind a rock, all three men had fallen. But the attack did not stop there. The Skeletons continued to strike, hacking without pause, and by the time they turned away, there was little left beyond hunks of flesh and a spreading pool of blood. The donkeys had panicked at the first smell of blood and had bolted, and I was surprised the Skeletons did not pursue them. Perhaps they felt mere pack animals were beneath their notice. I know I could scarcely breath as I flattened myself against the ground and prayed they did not retrace their steps, for if they did, I knew I would be next. But Ulric smiled upon me, and the fiends continued on across the narrow path the ill-fated travellers had found, scaling the cliff face beyond and vanishing over the ridge. Only then did my hands unclench and my mouth open to gulp at the cold mountain air.</p>\n<p>Never have I seen such ferocity, such single-mindedness, as that attack. I shudder to think what would happen were more such creatures to emerge from the tomb that must house them.</p>\n<p>But not all is gloom for me. Today I spied the Skeletons again and I followed them from a distance, careful to stay far enough back they would not detect my presence. Every time I thought they might see me, I ducked down behind rocks and waited several breaths before peering about. Fortunately, they are easy to spot against the dark granite, and I do not need to be close to mark their path.</p>\n<p>After several long hours, the skeletal patrol completed its rounds. I watched as they entered a small, circular valley&mdash;and disappeared through a crack in the western cliff wall! I waited several minutes and then, when nothing else had stirred, slid down to the valley floor. From this vantage I could see markings and shadows on that cliff face. They were clearly manmade.</p>\n<p>Looking more closely, I made out rough columns on either side of that crack. Detail was long since gone, worn away by wind and rain, but the shapes were there. And the crack was too straight, too even to be natural. Around it on both sides and above was a wide, shallow bump that ran even across the top and then smoothly down on both sides. It was a doorframe! The crack was no mere split in rock but the gap in a partially opened door!</p>\n<p>I knew for certain, and my heart sang with joy, when I spied the cartouche set near the junction between wall and floor, off to the left side. The hieroglyphs there were badly worn, but I could see enough to recognize them as Nehekharan and to make out the symbol for &ldquo;king.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I had found the tomb at last!</p>\n<p>Before the entrance to the tomb I discovered a stele inscribed with various languages, including Nehekharan and the runes of the Dwarfs. I have taken a rubbing. Perhaps it will be worth something to a scholar back in the Empire.</p>\n<h2>Journal entry, day 62</h2>\n<p>The tomb, the tomb! It haunts my dreams! I shall never escape those carvings, those murals, those lifelike statues!</p>\n<p>Within the entry chamber was a circular mosaic with a large scarab of black onyx set at its centre. The ceiling was decorated to show a miniature of the night sky and the walls were lined with statues of warriors in armour.</p>\n<p>The next contained a multiude of doors guarded by armoured skeletons who thankfully were immobile.</p>\n<p>The third chamber was a great hall, desiccated corpses posed upon benches or leaning on pillars in some obscene mockery of life.</p>\n<p>It was from this chamber that I discovered the chamber of sarcophagi. Twelve in total, they each bore a plaque and tapestry depicting their deeds in life. And each contained more riches than I had ever seen before. Much of it I had to leave behind, lacking as I did a pack animal to hold it. But I recorded the items contained within each sarcophagus and took a rubbing of each cartouche. They were as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 1]</strong></p>\n<p>Three ebony fingers.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 2]</strong></p>\n<p>A crystal eye, a false nose, ears and lips made from gold.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 3]</strong></p>\n<p>A jewelled arm.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 4]</strong></p>\n<p>A silver leg inlaid with jade and lapis lazuli.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 5]</strong></p>\n<p>A pewter torso, padded with silk.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 6]</strong></p>\n<p>A set of ivory teeth, a wooden arm and a clay foot.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 7]</strong></p>\n<p>Two ebony legs.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 8]</strong></p>\n<p>An ornate wig and a golden ear horn.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 9]</strong></p>\n<p>A black onyx hand.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 10]</strong></p>\n<p>A silver and marble face mask.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 11]</strong></p>\n<p>A wooden head, arms, body and leg.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 12]</strong></p>\n<p>A gold tongue and silver eyes.</p>\n<p>In that same chamber I discovered a golden sword in the hands of what I can only imagine to be a very unlucky tomb robber of some distant age. He did not manage to get very far with it, as I assume it came from that very same chamber. I took that with me in the hope it might afford some protection for the journey out of the damned valley.</p>"}

{"_id":"IBVC5FzS1Y0h0BSn","name":"Tavelli Ambush","content":"<h1>Claw Mark</h1>\n<p>The following encounter takes place at night, as the Characters are walking through one of the more pleasant parts of the city.</p>\n<p>Ideally, they should have a good deal of their equipment with them, as they will have no time to go and pick up anything left in their lodgings.</p>\n<p>As they are strolling through a particularly dark and quiet street, the door of a house suddenly bursts open and a young man, dressed only in his night-clothes, rushes out yelling,<em> ‘Help me, someone, please!’</em></p>\n<p>As he catches sight of the party, he turns and races towards them. A large bruise covers one side of his face. As he rushes over, gasping for air, a dark shape appears, silhouetted in the doorway of the house. The man gasps out one last sentence, <em>‘They’ve got my father… Don’t let them take him… Hurry…’ </em>before an audible twang comes from the doorway, followed by a much closer thud.</p>\n<p>The unfortunate young man collapses into the arms of one of the Characters (perhaps one who is drawing or who has already drawn a missile weapon of their own), choking and coughing up blood. A crossbow bolt is buried in his back.</p>\n<p>The shooter is a Yellow Fang cultist by the name of @Actor[1rPGO0e1jLvyOXg0]{Peter Tavelli}, ordered to stop Ernest from raising the alarm while [Skretth’s minions] took his captured father away through an old, forgotten stone passageway that travels into the house through a flagstone in the cellar.</p>\n<p>Tavelli retreats back inside the building and watches the Characters’ reactions through the hall window. The Characters are likely to chase Tavelli into the house, remembering the urgency of the dying man’s last words. If they pursue, Tavelli leads them into a trap in the house before trying to get back to the cellar and the secret passage. If he is caught or cornered, he swallows a capsule of concentrated Heartkill (WFRP, page 306) containing four doses of the poison. It may not kill him, but even so his fanatical loyalty to his cult and to the Skaven ensures that all Tests to make him talk are <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong>.</p>\n<p>If particularly cowardly adventurers refuse to enter the house, the adventure can be brought to them. The Skaven are very interested in capturing the party, since they are the only (living) people who know what happened to Klauss. They may be grabbed during the night and thrown into the cells in the sewers (see Into The Sewers, below) to await sacrifice. The Characters will then have to escape, though they will not have to worry about Klauss: he will already have been sacrificed.</p>\n<h2>Upstairs, Downstairs</h2>\n<p>If he sees that he is being followed, Tavelli races up the stairs in the hall, making sure the Characters see him. If they pursue him up the stairs, he kicks over a decorative wine barrel standing on the landing and sends it crashing down towards his pursuers.</p>\n<p>Anyone standing on the stairs, or at the foot (presumably to aim a bow or crossbow), must pass an <strong>Agility Test </strong>or suffer a Damage 3 hit and gain a @Condition[Prone] Condition. The test is <strong>Difficult (–10) </strong>for those on the stairs, and <strong>Challenging (+0) </strong>for those at the foot. At the GM’s option, those on the stairs may take additional falling Damage according to where they were when struck.</p>\n<p>As the Characters are distracted by the barrel, Tavelli rushes back down the stairs, leaping the banister half way down (a 3-yard jump). Assuming he lands safely, he races back to the cellar and enters the sewers through the secret passage. If anyone is still able to pursue him, he turns and fires his crossbow, or simply keeps running if his pursuers are too close. If capture seems inevitable, he swallows his poison capsule as described above.</p>\n<h2>The House</h2>\n<p>Only brief descriptions of the rooms are given, as it is unlikely the Characters will spend much time here. Should the party choose to loot the place, it might be prudent to have a Watch patrol come to investigate — this is a well-off district, and there is, in all likelihood, a body still in the street outside. All the rooms can be illuminated by lanterns hanging from the ceiling rafters, but at present, only those ones in rooms 1, 7, 11, and 12 are lit.</p>\n<h3>1. Hallway</h3>\n<p>The hallway is opulently furnished, with hunting trophies and tapestries on the walls. A plush blue carpet covers the floor.</p>\n<p>An elaborate staircase in the south-western corner spirals upwards to a balcony that overlooks the hall. There are three tapestries here, each worth 12 GCs. The hunting trophies are not especially valuable.</p>\n<h3>2. Dining Room</h3>\n<p>This room is currently a mess. Two bodies are sprawled across the floor. The table is upturned and shattered glass lies everywhere.</p>\n<p>What must once have been an expensive wooden cabinet has been smashed in at the front; its drawers and their contents have been scattered across the room. The two bodies are those of the servants who tried to oppose Tavelli as he pursued Ernest.</p>\n<p>The ensuing fight succeeded in completely devastating the whole room, leaving nothing of value unbroken.</p>\n<h3>3. Lounge</h3>\n<p>This is where Klauss used to entertain his guests while they relaxed after a meal. The room has not suffered the same fate as the dining room. Several luxurious armchairs, a large decorative fireplace, and an elaborate sideboard provide grand furnishing.</p>\n<p>Four paintings hang on the walls, each worth 7 GCs, but again, looting should be discouraged.</p>\n<h3>4. Kitchen</h3>\n<p>This large room has a flight of stone stairs leading down into the cellar. Two clubs rest in a puddle of blood, evident to anyone entering the room. A successful search turns up an ornamental clasp decorated with the symbol of the Horned Rat: three crossed bones forming the shape of an inverted triangle. All three items were dropped during the scuffle between Klauss, Ernest, and the cultists, and the clasp may reveal just what the Characters are up against. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Theology or Middenheim)</strong> Test reveals the nature of the symbol and its connection to the Skaven. Even so, many Characters may believe that the Skaven are no more than a fairytale.</p>\n<h3>5. Corridor</h3>\n<p>A corridor connects the hall to the kitchen. As it is a part of the house that guests would not normally see, it is merely stone￾flagged, showing none of the splendour seen elsewhere.</p>\n<h3>6. Storeroom</h3>\n<p>This is where all the food and other domestic requirements of the house are kept, under lock and key. However, when Klauss and Ernest went to investigate the sounds of the cultists breaking in, they armed themselves with clubs kept here (now to be found in the kitchen), and Klauss forgot to lock the door in his hurry.</p>\n<p>Thus, the door is slightly ajar, the keys still in the lock.</p>\n<p>Inside are several sacks of grain, stacked neatly against one wall along with many other common food items.</p>\n<p>A wooden crate marked ‘DANGER! EXPLOSIVES’ sits innocently in the corner, and contains four Bombs (WFRP, page 295). In addition, there are two lanterns here, three spare flasks of oil, and a tinderbox. The Bombs could prove very useful to the party in the later part of the adventure, should they choose to take them.</p>\n<h3>7. Balcony</h3>\n<p>The stairs from the hallway spiral upwards to this balcony, which overlooks the hall below. The floor here is also covered in blue carpet, but there are no adornments, save for a large, decorative wine barrel on the landing.</p>\n<h3>8. Guest Chamber</h3>\n<p>Visitors to the house are normally accommodated here. A large four-poster bed is set against one wall; a set of drawers and a large wardrobe provide the other furnishings. There is nothing of real value here.</p>\n<h3>9. Servants’ Quarters</h3>\n<p>This large room contains four beds, only two of which have been occupied recently (by the servants lying dead in the dining room). The room is not as well furnished as the rest of the house, but still represents very good servants’ accommodation.</p>\n<h3>10. Corridor</h3>\n<p>This corridor separates Klauss and Ernest’s bedrooms off from the rest of the house, providing them with more privacy. As with the hall and balcony, the floor is covered with blue carpet.</p>\n<p>Two paintings hang on the walls, worth approximately 7 GCs each.</p>\n<h3>11. Master Bedroom</h3>\n<p>This is the largest bedroom in the house, and is where Klauss usually sleeps. An ornate rosewood cabinet is set against the wall opposite the four-poster bed, together with an equally ornate set of drawers and a spacious wardrobe. The drawers are all filled with personal belongings and clothes, but a successful <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test made while searching the wardrobe turns up a false bottom concealing a secret compartment that contains 28 GCs, 25 shillings, and 300 pence.</p>\n<h3>12. Ernest’s Bedroom</h3>\n<p>This isn’t quite as luxurious as the master bedroom. It is relatively sparsely furnished with a single bed, a wardrobe, and a chest of drawers.</p>\n<h3>13. The Cellar</h3>\n<p>This stone-flagged room is filled with barrels and casks containing a wide variety of fine wines and ales. A flight of stairs leads up into the kitchen in one corner; in another corner a flagstone has been lifted out of the floor, revealing the entrance to an old, long-forgotten tunnel that leads into the sewer system. This is the way Tavelli and company gained entrance to the house; neither Klauss nor Ernest knew of its existence. If Tavelli has already rejoined his companions, the flagstone has been replaced, and a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception </strong>Test is required to find the hole — assuming the searcher has a reason to suspect such a tunnel must exist (for example, having heard the grating sound of the flagstone being pulled back into place).</p>\n<h2>INTO THE SEWERS</h2>\n<p>Beneath the hole, a rusty, iron-runged ladder leads down a narrow shaft for 10 yards or so, finally emerging in a rough￾hewn stone corridor. The course of the adventure from this point depends very much on what has happened to Tavelli.</p>\n<h3>Tavelli Escaped</h3>\n<p>If he has successfully managed to escape down the shaft, he returns to Skretth immediately and reports what has happened.</p>\n<p>He only mentions the Characters if they are pursuing him, giving the Skaven time to ready for the Characters and step up the guard around the sacrificial chamber, so that when the time for the ritual (midnight) comes, it is much harder for the Characters to ruin it.</p>\n<h3>Tavelli Killed</h3>\n<p>If the Characters killed Tavelli, or if he killed himself, he will not be missed for some time — with the impending sacrifice, the Skaven have more important things to worry about.</p>\n<p>Skretth’s experiments have not been going well. He really has no idea how to achieve his goal, and he is beginning to worry that his followers will soon lose patience. Apart from anything else, he is constantly under the influence of Mandrake, and rational thought (in so far as a Grey Seer is ever capable of it) is far beyond him.</p>\n<p>The guard around the sacrificial chamber is not increased, and consequently the Characters’ task is made a little easier. Any attempt to impersonate Tavelli by wearing his clothes imparts a +20 bonus to any relevant Skill: the Skaven have difficulty telling one Man-thing from another, and they can seldom be bothered to try. Even so, there are several parts of the complex where Humans are not permitted, and trying to enter them will arouse suspicion. The cultists know exactly where they can and cannot go.</p>","folder":"UcNpjukIpiZkjgIv","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"IMgNDfHZZwJrKjgw","name":"Criticals and Fumbles","content":"<p>During the cut and thrust of combat, accidents, mistakes, and moments of extraordinary skill can happen in quick succession. To represent the unpredictable extremes of a life-or-death skirmish, there are Criticals — extraordinarily good hits — and Fumbles — egregious errors.</p>\n<h4>Criticals</h4>\n<p>Any successful Melee or Ranged Test that also rolls a double causes a Critical. This means you have dealt a significant blow, and it even happens when you are the defender in an opposed Test.</p>\n<p>If you score a Critical, your opponent receives an immediate Critical Wound as your weapon strikes true. Beyond that, SL is calculated as normal, as is who wins any Opposed Tests.</p>\n<h4>Fumbles</h4>\n<p>The converse of Criticals, any failed combat Test that also rolls a double is a Fumble, which means something very unfortunate has occurred. To determine what happens, roll on the @Table[oops]{Oops! Table}.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Deathblow</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some players like a heroic approach to combat, with characters able to wade through lesser foes. If this suits your style of play, use the following rule: </em></p>\n<p><em>If you kill a melee opponent in a single blow, you may move into the space the character occupied and attack another opponent if there is one available. You may keep doing this a number of times equal to your Weapon Skill Bonus, and may not attack the same Character more than once on the same Turn. Some creatures are so big they can activate this rule without killing any opponents.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Opposed Tests and Fumbles</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">During an Opposed Test, it is possible to Fumble and still win if you score a higher SL than your opponent. This is fine, and not a little hilarious, as you ineffectually tussle with your even worse opponent, potentially injuring yourself in the process.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Molli swipes her dagger at her opponent and rolls 66 for a fumble with -3 SL, but her opponent rolls 92 for -5 SL. So, Molli wins with +2 SL over her opponent, gaining +1 Advantage, which she may quickly lose as she also has to roll on the Oops! Table to see what unfortunate accident will befall her.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><em>Misfires!</em></h3>\n<p><em>If you are using a Blackpowder, Engineering, or Explosive weapon, and roll a Fumble that is also an even number — 00, 88, and so on — your weapon Misfires, exploding in your hand. You take full Damage to your Primary Arm location using the units die as an effective SL for the hit, and your weapon is destroyed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"c8pB03MJECRvVVdb","sort":75001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Combat"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Combat","sort":75001}}}
{"_id":"IOtd5Sndl5KLlo6C","name":"GM's Guide: Between Adventures","content":"<p>These rules — whilst entirely optional — present a streamlined and semi-abstracted method of handling everything else the Characters get up to between adventures. Whilst this certainly isn’t the case for every campaign, one of the main themes of Warhammer is that the Characters are normal people and that adventuring is the exception, rather than the rule, of their normal lives.</p>\n<p>If this theme is present in your campaign, and that the Characters are normal people except in the rare occasions that they’re adventuring, the rules for Between Adventures should definitely be a focus for your reading as the GM. Think of the Between Adventures rules as an alternate phase of play — we have the Adventuring Phase and the Between Adventures Phase. When not engaged in one, we’re engaged in the other!</p>\n<p>With this phase mentality, as the GM you may choose to run Between Adventures as a handful of dice rolls, quick decisions, and then move on to the next adventure. Alternately, you may have a ‘break’ session between adventures, where you employ these rules, and allow the Characters to explore their normal lives and pursue their own goals. These downtime sessions act almost more like mini adventures, which grant a lot of agency to your Players to express what they want to do and want to get out of future sessions.</p>\n<h3>A Day In The Life</h3>\n<p>The Between Adventures Phase is the perfect time to consider and adjust a Character’s Career, because it’s the best time to determine<em> if it’s actually their Career at all! </em>Are you actually a Rat Catcher if you never catch rats? Are you actually an Artisan if you don’t follow a trade? If all you do is hunch through sewers and stab mutants, exactly how much of a Scholar are you really?</p>\n<p>Both GMs and Players should be vigilant during this phase, to determine just how much a Character is actually like their Career. But make sure that this isn’t prohibitive: a Merchant doesn’t have to act like a Merchant, but maybe if she’s acting more like a Duellist, a Career change is in order? Use these shifts in attitude to help build a Character’s story, rather than direct it, and you’ll find a far more three-dimensional Character comes of it.</p>","folder":"tCLFt3MpljAU3OVd","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Between Adventures"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Between Adventures","sort":100001}}}

{"_id":"If8o9wgSOggLiHCV","name":"Banking","content":"<p><em>General Endeavor</em></p>\n<p>This Endeavour allows you to store funds for future use. As noted in Money to Burn, all coin remaining at the end of your ‘Between Adventures’ phase is lost before the next adventure begins unless it is saved with this Endeavour. So, if you have a lot of money spare it may be worth a trip to the bank. If you are using a Banking Endeavour to retain your money, you must first decide whether to save your money by investing it with a reputable banking institution, or to stash it somewhere less secure. </p>\n<p><strong>Investing</strong>: You must be of the Gold and Silver social tiers to save with a banking house. Your money will be reasonably safe and it should accrue interest. When undertaking a Banking Endeavour to deposit money in a bank, determine the interest rate of your account, by choosing a number between 1 and 10 (alternatively you may simply roll 1d10). This is the rate of interest you will accrue, and also how risky the investment is. Withdrawing funds requires another Banking Endeavour. This may take place immediately after the initial Endeavour, or after subsequent adventures have occurred. Roll 1d100: if you roll equal to or less than your rate of interest, the venture has gone bankrupt and you have lost all of your money. If you roll over the interest rate, you receive your initial funds, plus the interest accrued. </p>\n<p><strong>Stashing</strong>: All characters may choose to stash their loot. This is a risky strategy, involving hiding it on your person, in your mattress, or burying it somewhere. Stashed money never accrues any interest. Players may withdraw money from a stash before the start of an adventure, without undertaking an Endeavour. Roll 1d100: if you roll 10 or lower, your stash has been found and you have lost all your money, otherwise you recieve your initial funds. </p>\n<p>If you successfully withdraw your funds they will be available for you when you start your next adventure, in addition to any funds secured via an Income Endeavour. </p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:<em> Gerhard and Ulli’s courage in the face of a Greenskin horde (not to mention some judicious looting) has earned them a haul worth 10 gold crowns each. The ever-prudent Gerhard decides to place his money with the esteemed banking house Bent, Crooke &amp; Scarper. The GM rolls 1d10 with a result of 6. Gerhard will earn 6% interest on his deposit (12 silver shillings, and the bank will fail if he rolls 6 or less on d100 when he tries to make a withdrawal. </em></p>\n<p>Ulli — a gambler at heart — buries his money near a mile-marker on the road to Ubersreik. He doesn’t need to make an Endeavour to get access to his loot, but tragically he rolls 07 when he tries to recover it, and finds nothing but freshly disturbed earth, an empty chest, and whole heap of regret.</p>","folder":"3inZgCNdZwR3yWXW","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"General Endeavours"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"General Endeavours","sort":200001}}}

{"_id":"IrqVQIbQazICwFTL","name":"Reikland Council","content":"<p>The day-to-day business of ruling the province is handled by the Reikland Council, which comprises ten &lsquo;High Lords&rsquo;. The council meets weekly in the Wilhelm Chamber of the Volkshalle in Altdorf to discuss matters of import. It is rare for more than six of the high lords to attend simultaneously, and almost unheard of for the prince to attend in person.</p>\n<h4>The High Lords of the Reikland</h4>\n<p>The Ten High Lords of the Council of the Reikland, are appointed by the grand prince. Whilst most commoners could never hope to encounter such luminaries, their agents and representatives can be found everywhere.</p>\n<h4>High Lord of the Chair</h4>\n<p>A close advisor to the grand prince, the High Lord of the Chair officially leads the Reikland Council in the elector count&rsquo;s stead.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord of the Chair, the stoic Graf Archibold von @JournalEntry[AhL154uxwRaa2157]{Lilahalle}, was granted the influential position after being gravely wounded whilst saving the life of Emperor Luitpold III from an assassin&rsquo;s blade. Lingering, painful injuries confine him to a steam-driven wheelchair; an irony only the unwise note aloud.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Steward</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Steward is the only man legally allowed to judge a crime committed by the lord of a Reikland Estate. As a High Lord Stewart&rsquo;s Court is rarely called &mdash; most lords being simply too powerful to call to task &mdash; the position is largely ceremonial. Nevertheless, the High Lord Steward is arguably the most senior High Lord, and often stands in for the Grand Prince when he is unable &mdash; or unwilling &mdash; to attend court.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Steward is Archduke Adelbert von B&ouml;genberg, a quiet man with little experience of the law, but a shrewd understanding of people. As much of the grand prince&rsquo;s time is taken up with imperial matters, he is arguably the&nbsp; de facto&nbsp; ruler of the Reikland, much to the High Lord of the Chair&rsquo;s chagrin.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Treasurer</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Treasurer is responsible for the Reikland&rsquo;s treasury and for raising revenues. The position is extraordinarily important and is almost always held by a close ally of the crown.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Treasurer is the aging genius Grafina Elena von Midwald, a dear friend of the previous grand prince, well known for her outspoken appreciation of fine wine and fine men.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Ambassador</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Ambassador organises the Reikland&rsquo;s foreign relations and runs the Altdorf Black Chamber: the infamous spies of the Reikland.</p>\n<p>Graf Liepmund Holzkrug, the current High Lord Ambassador, is an intense, fiercely ambitious man, whose family are strong rivals to House Holswig-Schliestein in Altdorf. He is known for his vindictive nature, his ruthless politics, and his love of hunting rare and exotic game.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Judge</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Judge is the ultimate voice on all Reiklander Law, which is quite different from Imperial Law.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Judge of the Reikland also serves as Supreme Law Lord of the Empire: Lector Agatha von @JournalEntry[eFOFM7fsXgfThWnV]{B&ouml;hrn} of Verena. She is experienced in all legal matters, and widely regarded as one of the most intelligent people in the Empire, especially by those who have bribed her.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Chancellor</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Chancellor is the crown&rsquo;s spiritual advisor, and oversees the Reikland Chancery and the Silver Seal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Chancellor is High Priestess Halma Habermann of Sigmar, a robust woman with a pale complexion, rosy cheeks, and thick limbs. Though generally charming and approachable, she is zealously out-spoken in her opposition to the Colleges of Magic, and rumours abound regarding the atrocities she witnessed during her service in the Order of the Silver Hammer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>High Lord Chamberlain</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Chamberlain runs the Palace of Altdorf and the adjoining Volkshall. The position is arguably one of the most influential in the Reikland, as most high-level imperial politics take place within the chamberlain&rsquo;s domain.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Chamberlain is rake-thin Duchess Elze von Skaag, an astute negotiator and careful planner who publicly supports Emperor Karl-Franz in all matters. Elze&rsquo;s husband, Duke Alardus von Skaag, is said to be deeply frustrated at his wife residing in Altdorf and not in Skaggerdorf with him; by comparison, it seems to suit her perfectly as most evenings she can be found carousing through the city with her bodyguards.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Reiksmarshal</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Reiksmarshal is responsible for leading the armies of the Reikland, and ensuring each of the Reikland State Regiments is raised, financed, and made available to the crown as required.</p>\n<p>The current Reiksmarshal is the veteran general Duke Kurt Helborg, close friend and tutor to the current grand prince &mdash; Emperor Karl-Franz &mdash; and said to be the finest swordsman&nbsp;in the Empire. Helborg&rsquo;s military commitments ensure that he rarely takes his seat on the council, a circumstance that suits his natural inclination.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Constable</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Constable is the ultimate authority on the genealogy and heraldry of the Reikland.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Constable is smiling Grafina Matrella von Achern, a woman with no interest in genealogy, but a voracious appetite for political intrigue. She has made the most of this relatively inconsequential position, by chairing several private councils on the Grand Prince&rsquo;s behalf. It is hard to reconcile the bubbly, maternal demeanour she projects, and her reputation amongst her peers as the most ruthless woman in the Reikland.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Admiral</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Admiral is responsible for the Admiralty of the Reik, and thus the entire Reikland navy.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Admiral is the venerable Sea Lord Adalmann von @JournalEntry[mDwaCu4nzY0wHVWY]{Hopfberg}. The Sea Lord &mdash; who is now quite senile &mdash; took residency in the Great Hospice some fifteen years ago, and the Admiralty has governed the navy without his influence &mdash; or interference &mdash; since then.</p>","folder":"vrsSSGXYVnoGWa0s","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Politics"}}}

If challenged, Seel will admit to the deception. If Seel takes the party to Area lb more than once, PCs should be allowed a Navigate Skill Test to notice that the location is different (Seel is only seven).</p>\n<p>Seel saw a skull heading away from him, that is all. However, his imagination has elaborated this quite a bit, “breathing fire,” “howling,” “covered in horns and spikes,” and so on. Since the young lad half believes this by now, let the PCs determine the truth of the matter.</p>\n<h2>Jaufrerre Renardnée (Sigismund Halsbret)</h2>\n<p>One of the witnesses to Sighting 3, Jaufrerre has since decided to pack up and go. He worked at the Reuter household and inspection of his room (a corner of the hayloft), will reveal that all his clothes and few belongings have also gone. His employers considered him a lazy worker and are not too distressed about his disappearance.</p>\n<h2>Claude Leonnée (knud GropenfroTTeur)</h2>\n<p>Claude is the other witness to Sighting 3. He works for the Kallman farm and is somewhat stupid, needing to be prompted often in order to reveal the little he knows. He and Halsbret were out working when they spotted a skull heading towards them.</p>\n<p>Jaufrerre started running but Claude waited to hit it with his pet shovel, “Clod.” For whatever reason, the skull turned and flew back into the trees. Claude carries his shovel everywhere and even takes it to bed.</p>\n<h2>Erietta</h2>\n<p>This young woman currently lies unconscious in the Rocheteau house, tended by her mother and Elisabet Rocheteau. She will recover consciousness in about 2 days but will still be weak from blood loss. A successful Heal Skill Test will result in her regaining consciousness a half-hour later and will also reveal that she was bitten twice. Note that neither her mother nor Elisabet will allow any grubby little adventurer to grope Erietta’s body and must be convinced either of the individual’s medical training, or the need to discover information about the attack.</p>\n<p>Erietta was attacked by surprise and her only recollection is a “gleaming white face with red eyes” (Sighting 4 on Map 3a).</p>\n<p>More information can be gained from her “rescuers,” Vivete and Elaine Lillregard, and Imogen Uderlast. They heard a scream and ran over to help, but on seeing a skull on Erietta they immediately ran back. Their courage returned when they saw the skull flying off into the forest.</p>\n<p><em>Note:  Vivete and Elaine are twins and continually repeat what the other has just said and/or confirm the truth of the same statement.</em></p>\n<h2>Louen and Lunide Chambiten</h2>\n<p>This snobbish couple runs the only store in the village. Items commonly needed by farming folk are stocked at normal prices and, since the village is quite prosperous, they also stock some fancy goods as well. These are invariably useless; folding card tables, toast racks, garden gnomes, and so on. These items are sold at 25% more than the normal price.</p>\n<p>Lunide is the village gossip and knows many “truths” about people in and around Pritzstock:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Henri-Philippe has a mistress in Ubersreik and Parravon. (False: he only has a mistress in Parravon.)</li>\n<li>Aschaffenberg has been disowned for an “indiscretion.” (False: but he did get a servant girl pregnant.)</li>\n<li>Claude is wanted for murder in Parravon. (False: Knud has never been to Parravon.)</li>\n<li>Elisabet Rocheteau flaunts lovers before her husband. (False.)</li>\n<li>Gunter Semmelweiss spends a lot of time in the pig-shed. (True: he’s a miser and hoards money in the pig-pen.)</li>\n<li>Isolde Guderian got her gold brooch by “being nice.” (False.)</li>\n<li>And so on...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lunide has no time for legends, myths, and the like. If asked about Stefan Maranaeur (unlikely), she will recall him as a goodlooking wine merchant from Ubersreik, “...and they do say he had a woman in every place he did business.” If stuck for a true bit of gossip Lunide will invariably make something up (of a typically unsavoury nature).</p>","folder":"yB7s0OOrS3UGCVZv","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

It sits along a busy road under the eaves of oak trees. As with most things in the Empire, everything is not as it first appears. Tobias Wirtz the innkeeper has had enough of looking after the inn and he desperately wants to sell it. He is thoroughly tired of his life at the Green Man. He has had his fill of absconding guests, bossy knights, the constant threat of violence and fearful nights worrying about what awaits in the forest. And unbeknownst to him, his wife Jessica is having a torrid affair with Fabio the stable hand, the innkeeper&rsquo;s nephew. There is trouble in paradise.</p>\n<h3>Plot 2: Blood Brothers</h3>\n<p>Although most of the patrons in the inn did not believe the drunken peasant and his wild tales of buried treasure, two patrons thought they could be some truth to the story. The Gardet brothers are two local woodsmen who overheard Felix the peasant talk about his treasure map and they decided to profit from his good fortune.</p>\n<p>They decided to let Felix do all the hard work of finding the gems and they plan to ambush him in his room when he returns from the woods and steal the gems for themselves.</p>\n<h3>Plot 3: A lover&rsquo;s revenge</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately for poor Felix, the strange multicoloured tree was no ordinary tree. It was in fact a female dryad called Lorelei. She could not move and was stuck in her tree form because of a strange woodland malady known as Verdant Lurgy. The dryad was being cared for in the past few months by a male elf called Kel Thanna. While nursing the dryad back to health the elf grew fond of his patient and has fallen in love with her. Kel Thanna was unable to defend the dryad from the peasant&rsquo;s attack because he was busy fetching fresh water from a nearby stream. When he returned to the tree he found his beloved Lorelei was torn to pieces. He bade farewell to his dead lover and tearfully tracked her killer through the woods. He saw a man leaving the woods and quickly ran after him. The peasant did not see the elf following him and continued on to the inn unaware of the danger. The elf spotted the man entering the inn and decided to exact his bloody revenge in the Green Man inn.</p>\n<h3>Plot 4: Lady of darkness</h3>\n<p>Marianne de Maromme is a beautiful middle&shy;aged woman travelling with her servant girl. Her servant girl thinks that her mistress is bringing her to the nearest town to treat her to a new dress. However, this beautiful woman dressed in expensive clothing harbours a dark secret. She is a practitioner of the black arts, a cultist, a follower of the Chaos gods. Marianne de Maromme has arranged a meeting with a band of beastmen in the woods close to the Green Man inn.</p>\n<p>The beastmen have agreed to supply her with a shard of stone from their tribe&rsquo;s sacred herdstone. Their shaman has blessed the shard and Marianne plans to use it to help her cast more powerful Chaos spells. In exchange Marianne will deliver a virgin to them to be used in some despicable sacrifice. It looks like the poor servant girl won&rsquo;t be getting that new dress after all.</p>\n<h3>Plot 5: A classical trap</h3>\n<p>Ernst Seiler is an overly confident bounty hunter. He has journeyed to the Green Man inn to capture an evil wizard. His boss supplied him with this information and also supplied him with a piece of parchment that his boss claims contains text written in the Dark Tongue. The bounty hunter plans to show this text to the patrons of the inn and watch for suspicious reactions. He believes that the evil wizard will inadvertently betray himself with a raised eyebrow or a sharp intake of breath. Once he has identified his prey, the bounty hunter plans to wait until the right moment and attack the wizard single&shy;handedly, bring him to justice and claim a hefty reward.</p>\n<p>Ernst Seiler is not the brightest of sparks and doesn&rsquo;t realize he is being set up for a fall. His boss dislikes his cocky attitude and wants to take him down a peg or two. His boss has sent him on a wild goose chase in search of the evil wizard and unbeknownst to the illiterate bounty hunter the text is written in Classical instead of Dark Tongue. Instead of providing details of some foul ritual it actually reads:</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;The bearer of this message is a bit soft in the head. Please humour him and he will soon go away. Sincerely, Josef Bildenstein, Chief Warden, Feltbad Sanitorium. P.S. Lock up your goats. He has a soft spot for goats!&rdquo; (See handout).</em></p>\n<h3>Plot 6: Desperate Knights</h3>\n<p>Sir Thiery de Betencourt and his squire, Gillibert le Cler. They were on mounted patrol along the road a few hours away from the Green Man inn. They noticed a faint trail of smoke rising from above the tree line. Fearing that there was a possible forest fire they decided to go and find out exactly what was going on. The roadwardens galloped down the road and after a few minutes they discovered an unattended campfire by the side of the road.</p>\n<p>They both dismounted and while Sir Thierry extinguished the fire, Walter began to scan the nearby forest for any signs of the person who lit the fire. It was then that a couple of outlaws burst from the cover of the forest and ambushed the knight and his squire. After a brief skirmish one of the outlaws was killed and the other was captured.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately Thierry broke his leg during the fight. His partner must now make his way to safety before nightfall sets in. He knows the Green Man inn is his best hope but the prisoner and his injured colleague hamper him.</p>\n<h3>Plot 7: Silence is crimson</h3>\n<p>After many years of travelling, the last four remaining brothers of La Maisontaal are finally returning to a monastery in Bretonnia. Many years ago twelve brothers took vows of silence and journeyed into the Empire. They spent their time observing imperial life in all its forms. When they return home to the monastery they plan to spend years transferring what they have seen into illuminated texts. During their stay at the inn they will eat meals together, observe the patrons and meditate in their room. They will not communicate with anyone, not even with each other and they will not answer any questions. They will not speak even if they are physically attacked. Their eight dead brothers are testament to that.</p>"}

The usurper pays Germund well, but I know some things about the good Father's past that are better than a barrel of Karls to get his attention. So, I get him to show the message before he delivers it, I copy it and deliver it to you and your cipher-readers, my lord. Yes, I know how he gets the reply out. The father throws the message from his cell window to a honey wagon driver called Fynn, who takes it out to the courier, who then rides to Talabheim.

Spy Master is not an official post or a title: most Spy Masters lead normal lives as high ranking officials in the government or in some other prestigious position with connections both to high society and to the everyday running of the realm. Calling someone Spy Master is derogatory, and rarely said out aloud. Spy Masters has several trusted lieutenants who handle most of the actual clandestine business, leaving Spy Masters to organize the big picture. This means that the actual work Spy Masters do is not necessarily very physical. It consists mainly of plotting and organizing, analyzing data, planning operations and communicating with lieutenants, politicians and an occasional enemy agent. Some Spy Masters have more of a hand-on approach, especially in the less sophisticated areas, such as the northern and eastern parts of the Empire and the Border Princes. Often Spy Masters like that have a martial or even criminal background.</p>\n<p><strong>Species: </strong>Human, Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Wood Elf</p>\n<p><strong>Class: </strong>Courtier</p>\n<h3

{"_id":"K2jgWwBS2qWKWAai","name":"Shrine Description & Layout","content":"<p>The road is still passing through dense woodland but there is a clear side-turning, with a large white boulder to mark it.</p>\n<p>On one side of the boulder is carved the symbol of Ulric; on the other is the symbol of Sigmar - or what remains of it. It is defaced, someone has scrawled 'remember Bosel' on it.</p>\n<p>Half a mile down the turning is an open area of flattish rocky ground, an acre or two across. In the middle of it is a simple yet elegant building. It is larger than a normal wayside shrine, and in fact not unlike the temples typically found in larger villages: about forty feet long, and rising at one end to a low tower. A river runs along one side of the area, and beyond it the forest continues. On the edge of the clearing, next to the river and about seventy yards from the shrine itself, is an￾other building: smaller, lower and more functional, with shut￾tered windows.</p>\n<h2>The Interior</h2>\n<p>The interior of the shrine is dominated by a long, thin outcrop of pale rock, which glitters and glistens in the light of two dozen large lamps that hang from the ceiling. The lamps’ brass bodies are marked with the alternating signs of the wolf ’s head and the twin-tailed comet, and the imagery of Sigmar and Ulric alternates in a similar fashion throughout.</p>\n<p>There are no pews or prayer-stools in the shrine: the floor is clean but completely bare. Any of the attending priests can explain that this is because the Sigmarite way is to stand or kneel on bare stone, so they did not require pews; the Ulricans, not wanting to appear softer or less devoted, also eschewed their customary use of pews.</p>\n<p>At the far end of the shrine, the ceiling rises in an octagonal tower. Beneath the centre of the tower is the highest part of the rock outcrop, which stands about3 ft above floor level. A sharp break indicates where, according to the legends of both faiths, the god snapped a piece off the outcrop to defend himself.</p>\n<p>An impressive statue of Ulric, depicted holding a shard of rock, stands against the back wall . As in most of Ulric’s temples, an eternal flame burns in a circular stone fire-pit in front of the statue. On entering the shrine, the sound of the flame flickering is audible, whilst the smell of the fire lingers and the temperature drops significantly.</p>\n<p>An altar to Sigmar stands in the south-eastern part of this area, positioned so that worshippers facing it are looking in the direction of Karaz-a-Karak, the Dwarven citadel where, it is believed, Sigmar went on his last journey as a mortal. This alignment is common in Sigmarite temples, especially older ones.</p>\n<p>Interior walls separate the public area of the shrine from two robing rooms: one for Sigmarite priests; the other for Ulrican priests. Beneath each is a small underground treasury, reached by a steep stone staircase under a trapdoor, where offerings and valuable ritual equipment are kept.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Priests’ Quarters</h2>\n<p>This low, plain building accommodates the shrine’s complement of a dozen priests: six from each faith. Unusually, the Place of Shining Rock does not have any guest accommodation. Visitors are encouraged to pray in the shrine, leave a donation, and continue their journey. The priests have no objection to visitors pitching tents in the clearing for a night or two, but anyone planning on staying longer will arouse their suspicions. The shrine is a simple one, and there is nothing much to do here once one has prayed and donated.</p>\n<h3>The Hall</h3>\n<p>Double doors open onto a common hall and refectory. It is plainly furnished with two long, wooden tables flanked by benches.</p>\n<p>The room is so plain that it is austere and looks unfinished.</p>\n<p>Apart from a simple carved frieze around the top of the wall, decorated with alternating symbols of Ulric and Sigmar, everything is undecorated plaster and wood. A successful Charm Test may convince a Sigmarite priest to confess — privately, and not within the hearing of any other priest — that the lavish decoration found in other buildings associated with Sigmar’s worship has been neglected because the Sigmarites do not want to give the Ulricans any cause to echo the common northern sentiment that Reiklanders are all soft southern fops.</p>\n<p>An Ulrican priest, asked the same question, will reveal (again, privately) that the priests of the White Wolf are more than usually ascetic here, because they feel the need to represent northern toughness in front of the Sigmarites.</p>\n<h3>The Dormitories</h3>\n<p>To either side of the main hall is a door marked, respectively, with the hammer of Sigmar and the wolf ’s-head of Ulric. Each door leads to a dormitory accommodating six priests. These rooms are slightly more relaxed in their décor: the Ulrican dormitory is plain but comfortable; the Sigmarite counterpart is decorated tastefully, but not too lavishly.</p>\n<h3>The Kitchen and Stores</h3>\n<p>At the back of the main hall is a simple kitchen and store-room where meals are prepared and foodstuffs are stored.</p>","folder":"zhKNzx21YVsaN3CA","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

Sigmar rescues the king, and in return is named a dawonger, Dwarf-friend, and given the king’s greatest heirloom, the magical warhammer Ghal-Maraz.</p>\n<h3>-8 IC</h3>\n<p>After his father dies, Sigmar becomes chief of the Unberogen tribe.</p>\n<h3>-7 IC</h3>\n<p>Sigmar realises the threat the Greenskins pose is far too much for his tribe to tackle alone, so he starts a campaign to bring all the surrounding Human tribes under his rule.</p>\n<h3>-2 IC</h3>\n<p>After several years of warfare and diplomacy, Sigmar binds twelve of the human tribes under his rule and allies himself with several more.</p>\n<h3>-1 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The First Battle for Black Fire Pass</em>. The largest horde of Orcs and Goblins the world has seen is defeated by Humans and Dwarfs led by High Chief Sigmar and King Kurgan, ending the centuries-long Goblin Wars.</p>\n<h3>0 IC</h3>\n<p>Sigmar is crowned emperor over the chiefs of the twelve tribes and the Empire is born. The Dwarf Runesmith Alaric the Mad is commissioned to create twelve runeswords, one for each of the tribal chiefs, as a symbol of their office and as thanks for their sacrifices to end the Goblin Wars.</p>\n<h3>1 IC </h3>\n<p><em>The First War Against Chaos</em>. The newly founded Empire is attacked by the forces of Morkar the Uniter, Everchosen of Chaos. The war is desperate, short, and devastating. Eventually, Morkar is slain by Sigmar in a day-long battle that was said to have split the earth and rent the sky.</p>\n<h3>c. 2 IC</h3>\n<p>Sigmar names the twelve tribal chiefs his ‘counts’, which modern scholars claim can be sourced in the Classical word comes, meaning ‘companion’, for they were his companions on the battlefield against the Greenskins and against the Chaos tribes from the north.</p>\n<h3>c. 7 IC</h3>\n<p>Sigmar kills the Necromancer Morath and takes the Crown of Sorcery. Recognising its evil, Sigmar locks it away beneath Reikdorf.</p>\n<h3>11 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Battle of Drakenmoor</em>. The Great Enchanter, Constant Drachenfels, leads an army of Goblins and Daemons against Sigmar’s new capital and suffers the first defeat of his eternal existence. This shocking loss will haunt him long after he reincorporates several centuries later.</p>\n<h3>15 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Battle of the River Reik</em>. Nagash, the Lord of Undeath, gathers a shambling horde of unliving monsters, and attempts to claim the Crown of Sorcery from Sigmar. The Undead almost overwhelm the Reiklanders and their Dwarf allies, but, after an exhausting battle, Sigmar eventually strikes Nagash down, causing the unliving army to crumble to dust.</p>\n<h3>50 IC</h3>\n<p>After five decades of extraordinary rule, Sigmar vanishes. To avoid destroying Sigmar’s empire, the tribal chiefs eventually agree to vote for a new emperor from their own number, and select Siegrich of the Asoborn tribe. Thus, the counts became ‘elector counts’, and each swears to be a companion and protector of their elected emperor.</p>\n<h3>51 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Siegrich I dies in a hunting accident. After a fraught month, Prince Hedrich of the Unberogens is elected Emperor Hedrich I, bringing the seat of the Empire back to Reikdorf.</p>\n<h3>69 IC</h3>\n<p>Johann Helstrum arrives in Reikdorf and claims to have holy visions concerning Sigmar. He preaches that he witnessed Sigmar’s Ascension to Godhood. Such is the love the Unberogens have for their lost emperor, Helstrum is readily believed.</p>\n<h3>73 IC</h3>\n<p>Johann Helstrum builds a temple to Sigmar in Reikdorf. History will forever remember him as the first Grand Theogonist of </p>\n<p>the Cult of Sigmar, and the first man to recognise Sigmar’s divinity.</p>\n<h3>c. 100 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Hedrich I receives the twelve runeblades from Alaric the Mad that were commissioned 100 years earlier. Each of these ‘Runefangs’ is a unique weapon of extraordinary power, and they are passed to the tribal chiefs. In time, the Runefangs will become powerful symbols of the Elector Counts.</p>\n<h3>246 IC</h3>\n<p>A High Temple to Sigmar is completed in Reikdorf, and it acts as the centre </p>\n<p>of worship for a cult that now extends throughout the Empire. This rapid expansion leads to open conflict with the cults of Ulric and Taal.</p>\n<h3>990 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Ludwig I, commonly called Ludwig the Fat, grants the Grand Theogonist a vote to select the next emperor. Though some Elector Counts cry foul, and the other cults are astounded at the blatant favouritism, Emperor Ludwig appears far more interested in the lavish banquets prepared for him by the Cult of Sigmar in Reikdorf.</p>\n<h3>1000 IC</h3>\n<p>1000 years after Sigmar was crowned emperor, the Cult of Sigmar completes a new High Temple in Reikdorf. It is the largest temple in all the Empire, and cements Sigmar worship as the primary cult in the Reikland. In celebration, Emperor Ludwig </p>\n<p>I renames his city Altdorf, demonstrating its age and importance to the Empire as a whole.</p>\n<h3>1053-1115 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Rule of Boris Goldgather</em>. Emperor Boris I proves to be exceptionally unpopular and corrupt, with his rule known for exorbitant taxes, weak leadership, and a complete neglect of the military.</p>\n<h3>1106-1110 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Rise of the Drakwald</em>: Beastmen and other vile creatures swarm from beneath the twisted bowers of the Drakwald, sacking villages, towns, and fortifications across the Drakwald province. When the last heir to the Drakwald throne is slain in battle with an enormous Bestigor, Emperor Boris I chooses to place the Drakwald Runefang in his Altdorf palace. Publicly, when a suitable heir is found, the Runefang will be passed on. Privately, Boris has no intention of ever giving up the magical blade.</p>\n<h3>1111-1115 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Black Plague</em>. Disease sweeps through the Reikland, killing nine in every ten people, and debilitating half of those left alive. Skaven then erupt from their under-Empire and attack. When Emperor Boris I dies of the plague in 1115 IC, no-one replaces him in the ensuing anarchy. </p>\n<p>1115-1124 IC</p>\n<p><em>The Rat Wars</em>. Skaven move to systematically enslave the remaining population of the Empire, and effectively wipe-out what remains of the Drakwald province. In response, Elector Count Mandred of Middenland rallies a desperate defence, and with the help of Elven allies from the laurelorn Forest, finally drives the Skaven back below ground. At the end of the war, the victorious Mandred is elected emperor by the three surviving elector bloodlines.</p>\n<h3>1152-1359 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Age of Wars</em>. Emperor Mandred II is assassinated by the Skaven in 1152 IC. The Elector Counts cannot agree on a successor as they are too concerned about rivals invading their devastated grand provinces, so a fraught interregnum ensues for over two centuries. During this time, the Princes of the Reikland rule their Grand Province unfettered as civil war rages across the Empire.</p>\n<h3>1359-1547 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Time of Two Emperors</em>. In a desperate bid to end the bloodshed, the Electors meet in Altdorf and eventually agree on a choice for emperor, crowning Elector Count Wilhelm of Stirland as emperor by a majority of one. Elector Countess Ottila of Talabecland is outraged at this, and claims the vote is rigged. When she returns to Talabheim she declares herself Empress without a vote, and is supported in her claim by the Cults of Taal and Ulric. She then outlaws the Cult of Sigmar in Talabecland, a decree that stands for almost a thousand years. The civil wars escalate.</p>\n<h3>1421 IC</h3>\n<p>Shipbuilding rises to prominence in Altdorf’s natural harbour, the Reiksport. Soon, quality vessels built in the Reikland are plying the Reik river system.</p>\n<h3>1489 IC</h3>\n<p>The prince of the Reikland formally commissions a navy, worried about the influence of ships sailing from Talabheim, Carroburg, Nuln, and Marienburg. To help limit their influence, Altdorf builds several low bridges across the Reik and Talabec to block larger ships and to control trade.</p>\n<h3>1547-1979 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Time of Three Emperors</em>. After Sigmarites botch an assassination attempt when Electors refuse to back their choice for the next emperor, the Elector Count of Middenland denounces the imperial elections as a corrupt sham, and declares himself the rightful emperor. He has the support of the cult of Ulric, which had recently fallen out with the Talabecland emperors. </p>\n<p>The Empire now has three Emperors: The Electoral Emperor supported by the cult of Sigmar, the Ottilian Emperor supported by the Cult of Taal, and the Wolf Emperor supported by the Cult of Ulric. The civil wars intensify. </p>\n<h3>c. 1450-1550 IC</h3>\n<p>Knights returning rich from the crusades against Araby found new knightly orders and chapterhouses across the Reikland. They also fund the first temple of Myrmidia in Altdorf, a simple building sponsored by the newly invested Knights of the Blazing Sun.</p>\n<h3>1681 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Night of the Restless Dead</em>. The dead stir in the Gardens of Morr. Corpses rise, bones rattle, and the dead walk the land, sowing terror and confusion. Entire towns and villages are overrun before dawn brings a reprieve from the rapacious hunger of the deceased.</p>\n<h3>1707-1712 IC</h3>\n<p><em>WAAAGH! Gorbad!</em> and the First Siege of Altdorf. Taking advantage of the divided Empire, the Orc Warboss Gorbad Ironclaw invades with a tide of Greenskins at his back, destroying the Grand Province of Solland, sacking Nuln and much of Wissenland, and eventually sweeping through the Reikland razing almost a third of its settlements before his green wave eventually breaks against the walls of Altdorf; but not before the Prince of Altdorf, and Electoral Emperor, Sigismund IV is killed.</p>\n<h3>1940 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Poisoned Feast</em>. The Great Enchanter, Constant Drachenfels, in one of his most famous treacheries, invites the Electoral Emperor, Carolus II, and the entire imperial court and its families, to a great feast held in his castle. Drachenfels poisons his guests, paralysing them. He then starves them to death in front of the marvellous banquet he prepared. This wipes out several important noble bloodlines of the Reikland, deeply destabilising the grand province and the Electoral Emperors as a whole.</p>\n<h3>1979-2303 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Dark Ages</em>. Elector Countess Magritta of Westerland is elected empress, but the Cult of Sigmar refuses to crown her, or indeed any other Elector Count or Countess, leaving the Electoral Emperors without a voted emperor. The entire electoral system collapses, and soon most provinces fight only for themselves. Petty warlords claim titles on a whim as new kingdoms, counties, duchies, princedoms and more rise and fall as terror spreads across the former Empire.</p>\n<h3>2010-2146 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Vampire Wars.</em> The Empire has collapsed into thousands of competing factions, and the Vampire Lords of Sylvania rise to exploit the turmoil. In total, three major wars result as three different vampire counts attempt to eradicate the fractured Empire. Each time, the Vampires are driven back through a mixture of unlikely alliances, desperate gambits, and clever strategy.</p>\n<h3>2051 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Second Siege of Altdorf</em>. The vampire lord Vlad von Carstein is slain. His wife, Isabella von Carstein, commits suicide, unable to continue unlife without him. Their armies soon splinter into feuding factions, ending the First Vampire Wars.</p>\n<h3>2100 IC</h3>\n<p>After the inconclusive Battle of Four Armies ended in multiple assassination attempts by supposed allies on the Empire side, it is decided that it is time to elect an emperor to pull everyone together. Elector Count Helmut is the most popular candidate for this, until its discovered he is actually a zombie in the thrall of Konrad von Carstein, the very vampire lord they are trying to defeat. All plans to elect an emperor are abandoned.</p>\n<h3>2135 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Third Siege of Altdorf</em>. The vampire lord Mannfred von Carstein launches a surprise winter attack on the Reikland capital as it recuperated from a summer of civil conflicts but is eventually driven back when the Grand Theogonist of Sigmar uses a forbidden spell to unbind the vampire’s necromancy.</p>\n<h3>2203 IC</h3>\n<p>A rift into the Realms of Chaos opens at Castle Drachenfels, resulting in the annihilation of almost every living soul from Bögenhafen to Ubersreik. After more than a week of terror, the rift mysteriously closes.</p>\n<h3>2302-2304 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Great War Against Chaos. </em>Asavar Kul, Everchosen of Chaos, leads a horde of unimaginable size into Kislev, laying waste to everything in his path. In response, Magnus von Bildhofen, a young Nulner noble claiming to be inspired by Sigmar, rallies the fractured and broken Empire into a mighty army to relieve Kislev. He eventually defeats Asavar Kul at the Gates of Kislev alongside Kislevite, Dwarf, and Elven allies.</p>\n<h3>2304-2369 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Reign of Magnus the Pious</em>. Magnus von Bildhofen is elected Emperor Magnus I, the first elected emperor representing all Sigmar’s Grand Provinces for almost a thousand years. Riding the wave of popularity he secured by winning the Great War Against Chaos, he immediately initiates sweeping reforms to end the corruption that previously brought the Empire to its knees, creating new laws to limit the nobility, cults, guilds and much more. He also oversees the foundation of many new institutions, including the formal creation of the Empire State Armies, Imperial Navy, and, controversially, the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, making magic legal across all the Empire for the first time. </p>\n<h3>2308-2310 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Third Parravon War</em>. The Bretonnian duchy of Parravon invades the Reikland across the Grey Lady Pass, claiming the military escalation in Ubersreik caused by the mustering of the new State Army breaks an ancient treaty. They are quickly driven back, and the following year Parravon is besieged. Eventually, after a year of occasional skirmishes outside Parravon’s extraordinarily high walls, and a great deal of standing around shouting insults, the King of Bretonnia treats on behalf of Parravon with Emperor Magnus I, ending the war.</p>\n<h3>2402-2405 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Fourth Parravon War</em>. The Bretonnian duchy of Parravon again invades the Reikland across the Grey Lady Pass. Ubersreik is besieged twice during the war, but doesn’t fall. Peace is eventually brokered by the intervention of Emperor Dieter IV who agrees to pay the Parravonese an extortionate sum of money to retreat, drawing much criticism at court.</p>\n<p>2415 IC</p>\n<p><em>The Night of a Thousand Arcane Duels</em>. War erupts between the Eight Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, razing large sections of the city and resulting in the death of six of the eight Patriarchs. The Cult of Sigmar pressures the Prince of Altdorf and Emperor Dieter IV to lock the Colleges down, which they do, resulting in the execution of many wizards, and effectively bringing legal magic use to an end in the Empire. Many of the surviving wizards flee the Colleges, never to return.</p>\n<h3>2420-2424 IC</h3>\n<p><em>WAAAGH! Grom!</em> The Goblin Warboss Grom the Paunch leads an enormous horde of Greenskins across the Empire, sacking many Reikland towns and villages, before eventually heading westwards, undefeated, where he then takes to the sea. The lack of wizards from the suspended Colleges of Magic is widely blamed for the repeated military defeats suffered by Reikland’s armies.</p>\n<h3>2429 IC</h3>\n<p>Westerland buys its independence from the Empire by bribing Emperor Dieter IV, reforming itself as The Wasteland with Marienburg as its capital. Using anti-corruption laws put in place by Magnus the Pious almost a hundred years earlier, the Elector Counts depose Dieter in the ensuing scandal. He is replaced by Grand Prince Wilhelm of House Holswig-Schliestein of the Reikland, who is named Emperor Wilhelm III, starting the imperial dynasty that rules the Empire to this day.</p>\n<p><em>The Battle for Grootscher Marsh</em>. Emperor Wilhelm III, under pressure from the Elector Counts to respond to the Wasteland’s secession from the Empire, gathers the State Armies to invade Marienburg. In late Autumn, the opposing forces meet at the Grootscher Marsh just outside Siert, and the Empire is routed by the advanced Marienburg navy, well-trained mercenaries and militias, and the magics of the Wasteland’s High Elven allies. Begrudgingly, Wilhelm verbally recognises the Wasteland’s independence, but refuses to ratify it with a treaty. Marienburg accepts this and draws their new border at Siert.</p>\n<h3>2430 IC</h3>\n<p>Appalled at the State Army’s inability to effectively counteract the Elven mages and Marienburg ships, Emperor Wilhelm III reinstates the Colleges of Magic after their 15-year suspension and invests significant resources into shipbuilding at the Reiksport.</p>\n<h3>2431 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Great Fire of Altdorf</em>. The newly reinstated Bright College accidentally sets Altdorf alight when a spell misfires, burning many buildings to the ground. Many lobby Emperor Wilhelm III hard to suspend the colleges again, but eventually he decides to keep them open, but with greater oversight from the Cult of Sigmar.</p>\n<h3>2453 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Fourth Siege of Altdorf</em>. The Liche King, Arkhan the Black, invades the Reikland with a seemingly endless swarm of walking corpses that march straight for Altdorf. Once the siege begins, Arkhan slips unnoticed into the High Temple of Sigmar and steals the dreaded Liber Mortis kept within. Minutes after he escapes, his army collapses, leaving thousands of carcasses mouldering outside the city walls as state soldiers look on in confusion and relief.</p>\n<h3>2480 IC</h3>\n<p>In Drachenfels Castle, Constant Drachenfels is slain by Crown Prince Oswald von Königswald of Ostland.</p>\n<h3>2483 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Luitpold III signs treaties with the Wasteland to allow warships of the Imperial Navy to pass through the city-port of Marienburg. For the first time since the secession of the Wasteland, the Reiklander navy is sailing the high seas, although the tolls to do so are extortionate.</p>\n<h3>2502 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Luitpold III dies in his sleep. In a close vote, Luitpold’s son is elected to replace him, and is crowned Emperor Karl-Franz I in the High Temple of Sigmar in Altdorf.</p>\n<h3>2505 IC</h3>\n<p>By imperial appointment, the playwright Detlef Seirk attempts to stage an ambitious play in Castle Drachenfels for Emperor Karl-Franz and the gathered nobility of the Empire. It goes disastrously wrong.</p>\n<h3>2508 IC</h3>\n<p>Malathrax the Mighty, an enormous Doomfire Dragon, terrorises the Vorbergland, razing villages and taking livestock, before its driven north across the Hägercrybs. After several months of pursuit, and the eradication of the entire Knightly Order of the Ebon Sword, the Dragon is slain by the Imperial Huntsmarshal, Markus Wulfhart, who places three arrows in its heart.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"J8dQ6pBcs8qRN8Bk","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Reikland"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Reikland","sort":100001}}}

She has her own home in Middenheim, and is never seen with Heinrich. Her role is simply to socialise with people on the edges of diplomatic and government circles, learning what she can and reporting back to Heinrich. A lot of her time is spent in the company of minor clerks, who are pleased to brag about their jobs to impress such an attractive woman. She has contacts and spies of her own in several major cities in the Empire, and in the Tilean City States. Nastassia is fully capable of stealing documents and undertaking other covert activities when necessary.</p>\n<p>If the Players are getting into a hopeless mess — truly hopeless, that is — Nastassia can give them some invisible help. Her role as Heinrich’s spy means that she is well placed to hear lots of minor gossip, including news on the party’s activities.

To keep some mysteries for the players to unravel, she does not know about the central intrigues within Middenheim: only snippets of odd behaviour connected with major NPCs.

So declaimed by Fra Albus Dominus of Wolfenburg, priest of Sigmar, this three hundredth day of the year 2510, to a great congregation of good folk in the high temple of that burg, and writ down as perfect testimony by R. Josephus, rubricator. Commend me, oh lord, to his Imperial Majesty Karl Franz, hammer of the heathens, everlasting in Sigmar&rsquo;s grace, world without end.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Gather close and listen now, be you ploughman or warrior, high-born or low. Attend me now. These words are meant for you, for are you not all men born of the Empire?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I see you nod. Aye, listen then, and consider. To be a man born of the Empire is to be one little part of a greater thing, and to play that part, a man must know his place in the workings of the World.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The first duty of a man is to rejoice! For the Empire is a glory upon the earth! It is the light by which the outer dark may be driven back! Never before, since the birth of the Ages, has man wrought such a great and civilising estate upon the face of the World!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;To the common-born man, this is a thing he must know, even though he cannot see it. Even the blessed Emperor himself, from the highest battlement of his palace, yet even from the loftiest tower of Middenheim, cannot see the edges of his dominion all of a whole. It has been said that a man, even with a good mount, will ride for a full half-year of his lifetime if he wishes to cross the Empire from one margin to another. And how many men, of the base and common kind, never venture further than the limits of their village, or the boundaries of their parish? Such men know nothing of the greater thing, except that which they are told by travellers and scholars; such men never behold a building more splendid than their own burg&rsquo;s small guild hall, or a tower more massive than the spire of their poor village church.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Yet, as the thinkers of antiquity have taught us, just because we cannot see a thing, does not mean it is not there. We do not see the lamp of the sun at night, but we know it sleeps safe in its cavity beneath the earth. We do not see almighty Sigmar, yet we do not doubt that He watches over us always.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;So it is with the Empire. We are girt about by its vast domain, wherein are mountains and moors, forests and pastures, rivers and vales, and many towns and greater cites, peopled by the common crowd and the noble born both. But we never see it whole and all together.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;To imagine it in full, imagine this in its part. In fair Altdorf, in the gleaming halls of Grand Cathedral of Sigmar, there is a chamber of most wondrous beauty. The pillars of the walls are wrapped entire with gold leaf, and the great casements look out across the River Reik itself, a splendid vista. Upon the walls hang many an arras tapestry on which are threaded scenes of hunting and sport, of war and victory, of Lord Sigmar and the Unberogen. Marvellous to behold! But it is the floor which most arrests the eye.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Into this wide surface is inlaid, by means of handsome craft, a mosaic of lacquered wood and polished metals, forming in all detail a mappa mundi, a chart of this world that is the Empire. Few men have had the privilege of seeing this mappa mundi, but just because you cannot see a thing, does not mean it is not there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I have seen it. I have seen it lit about with tapers. Such a thing it is...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The limits of the Great Chart are made of satin wood and silver thread, showing the icy bounds of our domain. Almost unbroken, a majestic circle of mountains surrounds the Empire, like the high brim of a vast chalice. Within that chalice bowl, the precious life-blood of the Empire and all its wealth is cupped.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Lime and rose wood segments interlock with burnished panels of green copper and ruddy brass to represent the extents of the eleven provinces, and rosettes of oak and maple, wound with gold wire, mark the places of the great city states. Each town or prosperous burg is a flat button of ivory. The web of rivers and their tributaries is chased out in bars of pearl and loops of spun steel. Lakes are slivers of looking-glass. The mighty forests of the realm, chevron darts of ebony, speckle the entire floor like the coat of a brindled mare.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Admire such craftsmanship! Here is Nordland, facing the sea. Here, if you look, Ostland, and Hochland too, dressed in forests, athwart the jumbled masses of the Middle Mountains. To the east there, Ostermark, guarding the line of the north against the cold encroach of Kislev, there rural Stirland and the Moot, the World&rsquo;s Edge Mountains climbing beyond them. To the south, Averland and Wissenland, contained to the east by the Black Mountains and to the west by the ancient forest tracts known as Loren. And there Talabecland, Middenland and Reikland.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Look closer now, at the proud cities: Nuln, pungent with black powder, the foundry of the Empire; Talabheim, the Eye of the Forest, its impenetrable wall protecting its pasture lands from the woods without; Middenheim, the city of the White Wolf, a craggy bastion raised above the world; and Altdorf, royal Altdorf, jewel of the Empire. And here too Wolfenburg, our own fair city, stalwart guardian of Ostland&rsquo;s reaches.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Marvel at it; rejoice! This Empire of man! Picture that fine chamber again, picture it as on a fair summer&rsquo;s evening, such as was the occasion when I witnessed it. Servants appear, dressed in fine livery. Flaming candles are brought out on golden sticks&mdash;one! two! a dozen! more!&mdash;and placed, each one particularly, upon the Great Chart to indicate the mighty cities and city-states. Then smaller tapers too, aflame also, carried in by more servants and set upon the mark of every noted town and burg. Such a sight! In the last rays of the sunlight falling in through the casements, the Great Chart is ablaze with a thousand points of light, a constellation that shapes out in scintillating glory the immensity of our domain!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Thus may a man rejoice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;But attend me now. If a man&rsquo;s first duty is to rejoice, his second is to beware. For all the golden splendour of the Empire, for all its worth and lore and monuments of stone, there stands against it great and perpetual jeopardy: enemies more numerous than all the trees of the forest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;They coil in the darkness; the ice-darkness beyond the rampart mountains, the shadow-darkness of the deep forests, the tomb-darkness of the pits beneath the earth. They lurk in ruins, in desert places, in the long grass of forsaken fields, in the creaking, green-black shade of forlorn woodlands. They scuttle in dry catacombs, they claw beneath the flint and granite of the lonely hills, they haunt the tumbledown ruins of villages long since abandoned by man. They even stalk our own dreams. And, as night comes, they keen with the whippoorwills and move against us; curious, greedy, wild, rapacious, hungry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The enemies are older than us, older even than the tribes we men of the Empire sprang from. Knowing only the clarion-cry of &ldquo;Murder All!&rdquo; they would set the world ablaze, make doom upon us, and carry off our heads on pikes!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;You quake and you tremble! Justly so! They would make battle trophies of us, cast down our walls, and burn our crops! Our womenfolk, our children, none may be spared the dreadful butchery!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;So we must watch for their first stirrings, and sharpen our blades. Place sentries on the walls. Close our gates at nightfall. Listen to the whisper of the wind and the sounds it may bring. Trust not the dark, or the scratching of rats, or even the neighbour whose ways seem alien. The enemy comes in all shapes and guises.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Some are beasts, some are wild, barbaric tribe-kin, some are vermin within our very walls. Most know nothing of our proud, fair gods, or if they do, know them only as bright things that they yearn to tear down and trample. They have spirits of their own, feral godlings and daemons which they worship with gleeful lust and to whom tributes are made in blood. In the name of Sigmar, we renounce all such misbegotten spirits!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;What enemies, you mutter. I work my craft and pay my tithe and sleep soundly, and I have not seen the like of them. Just so? Yes? Beware! Just because you cannot see them, doesn&rsquo;t mean they are not there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Consider their handiwork. There are bleak places in the Empire, out of the way of man, where certain ruins stand, open unto the elements. I have seen a few such edifices myself, and can attest to them. Time and weather have worn them plain, but it is still possible to discern that these ruins were not raised by human hands. They are the work of other kinds, other races that dwelt in these lands long before the rise of the Unberogen. We may suspect they are the relics of the fading races; the halfling men, the indomitable Dwarfs we sometimes welcome as allies, even, perhaps, the Slight Ones themselves, who linger in the ancient forest paths.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Whatever their makers&rsquo; identity, they are just ruins now. Cold and dead. But they tell of huge strength and formidable defence. Indomitable bastions, high towers, earthworks, siege walls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Yet none remain. For all their strength, they were overcome in the early times, and put to flame, and ransacked. Even they could not withstand the feral onslaught of the enemies in the dark. Even they could not withstand!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;But we must. This I say to you with the force of my heart. We must beware at all times, and be ready, peasant farmer and spurred knight alike, to fight, for Sigmar, for the Emperor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Empire has stood for twenty-five centuries. It has driven back the green-skin brutes from the mountains, the tribal hordes from the north, the incursions of the blasphemous Dark Gods themselves. If the Empire is to stand for another twenty-five centuries, it depends on each and every man born its son! You, and you, and you!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Rejoice, but beware! Rejoice, but beware! That is balance every man must keep in his mind. Picture the Empire again, the glorious chart, lit by a thousand candle flames. Its achievements are manifold, its power great. No feat of mankind is more worthy of protection and safeguard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;But now the evening light fades, and night closes in outside the casements. In the splendid chamber, shadows gather, deeper, darker, until we cannot see the map at all anymore. Only the taper flames burn, a thousand furious, fragile lights in the dark.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;How small they seem now, how far apart from each other! What tracts of darkness separate one flame light from another!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And in that darkness, we cannot see. But just because we cannot see, doesn&rsquo;t mean there isn&rsquo;t something there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The night wind picks up outside the casements. Close them fast, before it is too late! The scattered flames flutter, frantic in the black. One by one, they sputter and die.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;How quickly they go out. How easily they are extinguished.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;How total the darkness that remains.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Go from this place. Praise Sigmar, and go about your lives. Peddler, provost, woodsman, soldier, barkeep, coachman, chandler, goodwife... go to your varied callings and prosper. But keep the holy days and the festivals, bar the door at night, whet your blade&rsquo;s edge, and, in the name of Sigmar, keep watch against the dark.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;How quickly the lights go out!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Here ends the lesson.</p>"}

Its staff can be made into entirely new characters with just a name change and a few different personality quirks.</p>\n<h4>Frederheim</h4>\n<p>Best known as the home of the Great Hospice of Shallya (which is actually some distance from the village, deep in the quiet of the forest), Frederheim consists of no more than <em>The Dove</em> coaching inn (independent) and a handful of small shops that have grown up to serve its needs and to house a biweekly market for the surrounding farms.</p>\n<h4>Kutenholz</h4>\n<p>Kutenholz is the first stop in Middenland. It has a coaching inn called <em>The Wolf ’s Head</em> and a large shrine to Ulric nearby. <em>The Wolf ’s Head</em> proudly displays the emblem of @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.HqarwMVLyiaal4sK]{Castle Rock Coaches}. Although its staff does not turn away other lines’ coaches, Castle Rock receives preferential treatment. This treatment includes a few little perks: first pick of rooms, a 10% discount on food and lodging, and one free ‘Welcome to Middenland’ drink upon arrival.</p>\n<h4>The Forest Hearth</h4>\n<p>This fortified coaching inn stands beside the road with nothing but trackless forest on either side. Its walls are more than 20 ft high, and spiked on top. Beastman attacks on the inn itself are not common, but attacks on coaches have become more common lately, especially to the north of the inn. @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.wVPKOC48Odm7JJMQ]{Four Seasons} has made several attempts to take over the inn, since it is the only accommodation between Kutenholz and Bröckel. This location  would give them a significant advantage over competing lines. So far, though, their efforts have been unsuccessful, and the inn remains independently owned and operated.</p>\n<h4>Bröckel</h4>\n<p>This is an unremarkable small town, serving as a market for the nearby villages of Kupfengrube and Guthugel. The Bröckel Arms, on the southern edge of the town, is owned by Four Seasons. The passengers of other lines must rely on the smaller but more central <em>Market Inn</em>. Built to accommodate local farmers visiting the monthly market, this inn usually has four or five rooms and a dozen or so dormitory spaces free at other times.</p>\n<h4>Mittelweg</h4>\n<p><em>The Half-Way</em> House is one of the oldest inns on the Altdorf-Middenheim road. Its wide surrounding wall still bears the scars of attacks from the forces of Chaos two centuries ago. Named for its position roughly halfway between Altdorf and Middenheim, Mittelweg grew up around the grand House with its distinct turrets, which are now a welcome sight for weary travellers. They stand at each corner, and their two upper levels are equipped with arrow-slits.</p>\n<p><em>The Half-Way</em> House is proud of its history and location, and its staff pride themselves on their warm welcome.  Every evening they put on a ‘halfway celebration’ for travellers, with a fine (if expensive) meal, freely flowing drink, and souvenirs, including their novelty half-glasses and half-pint mugs. These mugs and glasses  appear full-size from one side, but are flat on the other, as if sliced in two vertically. These are normally brought to the table in pairs, with wooden clothes pegs holding the two halves together.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>On The Road Again</em></h3>\n<p><em>The journey north is an opportunity to set the tone of Middenheim. The weather gets colder, passing travellers get more grim, religious and cutural diffferences become more obvious, and rumours abound (@JournalEntry[ri289tDcFl3qOsaT]{News and Rumours}) as Characters hear of the troubles in the city. This is tempered by excitement about the carnival, though veterans of the Schaffenfest in Enemy in Shadows will no doubt be plagued by recollections of Bögenhafen and the calamity that was, hopefully, narrowly avoided there following that festival.</em></p>\n<p><em>All of this simply adds to the sense that Middenheim is about to become a fulcrum of great change in the Empire — which, one way or another, is certain to be true. </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Delberz</h4>\n<p>Travellers are often surprised when their coach arrives at Delberz: according to a number of inaccurate maps that are still in circulation, the town and the River Delb are almost 100 miles south-east of their true positions, and much closer to the River Talabec. Some blame the proximity of the Howling Hills for confusing map-makers, while others recall that @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris Todbringer} recently sacked his chief cartographer, Gulhein Tobwurst, over other, similar errors in his maps. The town itself is the largest on the highway, with a small but busy river-port.</p>\n<p><em>The Great Oak</em> inn, named after a huge and ancient tree that stands in the courtyard, caters to Four Seasons coaches, providing lavish fare for those travelling on and comfortable rooms for those stopping overnight. Most other overnight visitors use <em>The Wheel and Anchor</em> — owned by the town’s Merchants’ Guild,  and therefore immune to commercial acquisition — while midday arrivals are greeted by various hawkers and small shops ranged around the town square.</p>\n<h4>Sotturm</h4>\n<p>Sotturm is a small market town with ambitions. It has long been popular with Middenland’s guildmasters as a place to hold business negotiations: it is a neutral location with no allegiance to any town or city, and its location — on the highway and yet fairly out of the way — means that meetings do not attract too much attention. While the fare at The Tower coaching inn is of excellent quality, true epicures head for The Gilded Harpy: this marble building, with its grotesque yet undeniably masterful statue outside, would not look out of place in the wealthier quarters of Altdorf or Middenheim. Thanks to the wealthy guildmasters, who have bought estates around the town, it does a roaring trade at any time of year.</p>\n<h4>Malstedt</h4>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/imperial-crown.webp\" width=\"387\" height=\"287\" /></p>\n<p>At last, the oppressive forest opens up and the road winds upward through rolling hills. <em>The Imperial Crown</em> at Malstedt is large and welcoming, although its sign has recently been defaced: the gold crown has been painted over, and the head of a white wolf inexpertly added. Likewise, the emblem of Four Seasons Coaches by the door has been daubed over, and the staff no longer turn any coaches away. If asked about the changes, they say that there are some in Middenland who speak openly of seceding from the Empire and creating an Ulrican state in the north. But if pressed further, they claim that they do not know anything more, and hurry off to an urgent task elsewhere.</p>\n<h4>Grubentreich</h4>\n<p>This smallish market town supports a number of local villages and farms. The main local products — the meat, milk, and cheese of sheep and goats that graze the surrounding hills — are on sale everywhere. <em>The Bildhofen Arms</em> is named after the area’s ruler, Duke Leopold, and boasts a goat cheese that is well regarded across Middenland and beyond.</p>\n<h4>Schoninghagen</h4>\n<p>A brass plaque above a side-room at <em>The Skull and Cross</em> bears the inscription: <em>‘Here, in the Year of Sigmar 2369, was signed the Treaty of Schoninghagen, to the great glory of Middenland and the Todbringer Family. May Ulric and Sigmar protect them and bless their loyal subjects.’</em></p>\n<p>A <strong>Lore (History)</strong> Test — <strong>Challenging (+0) </strong>for native Middenlanders and <strong>Hard (–20)</strong> for everyone else — recalls that the treaty settled the details of Grand Duke Gunthar von Bildhofen’s abdication from Middenland, and established that the Baron of Nordland was to pay homage to the Graf of Middenheim. The inn’s staff  proudly tell the tale, if any traveller inquires.</p>\n<h4>Middenheim</h4>\n<p>The final leg of the journey is the shortest by distance, but can often take just as long as the others. All arrivals must go through certain formalities — mostly to do with the city’s new tax laws — and wait their turn to use one of the causeways or chair-lifts that run from the foot of the Ulricsberg to the city.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[ri289tDcFl3qOsaT]{News and Rumours}</p>\n<h3>Encounters</h3>\n<p>These encounters can be used to add variety to the journey, and to foreshadow events to come in Middenheim.</p>\n<h4>Survivors</h4>\n<p>This type of encounter becomes more frequent as the Characters travel deeper into the Drakwald, and tapers off as they come closer to Middenheim. Trudging along the roadside or begging the protection of an inn’s walls at night, the survivors of bandit or mutant attacks are ragged, penniless, and often wounded. Mothers carry children, the unhurt support the injured, and the young help the elderly along as best they can. Some claim to be nobles, and promise that their families will reward the Characters for seeing them safely to Middenheim, or Altdorf, or simply to the next coaching inn. Some of these may even be telling the truth. Others simply cluster around a coach or an armed group, clamouring for aid and protection.</p>\n<h4>Refugees</h4>\n<p>The closer the Characters come to Middenheim, the heavier the refugee traffic becomes, including Sigmarites, priests, dwarfs, alchemists, and wizards. There are Sigmarites of all classes, trades, and professions, telling stories of religious persecution.  Priests — not only of Sigmar but of other religions as well — who second the tales of anti-Sigmarite violence, and add that the Graf has approved a ruinous series of Temple Taxes, whose only purpose must surely be to drive out every religion save the worship of Ulric. In the crowd there are wizards and alchemists, who grumble about a ‘Scroll Tax’ on paper that makes Middenheim too expensive to live in. As well as Middenheim Dwarfs, who grumble about ‘ungrateful Manlings,’ but only admit privately to another Dwarf that they have been taxed beyond their means and lack the gold to remain in the City of the White Wolf.</p>\n<h4>Sons of Ulric</h4>\n<p>Closer still to Middenheim, the Characters are stopped at an impromptu road block. It is manned by a group of local toughs, all wearing the symbol of a wolf ’s head somewhere on their clothing. Declaring themselves to be the Sons of Ulric, they search the Characters’ coach and persons, looking for ‘<em>Sigmarite scum</em>.’ Anyone with anything that might be interpreted as indicating devotion to Sigmar — whether or not it actually does — is robbed, soundly beaten, and turned back into the forest.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the Characters actively resist, the ‘Sons of Ulric’ are more than happy to resort to violence: a wrong word or look is quite sufficient. If the Characters need to be rescued from the resulting fight, a patrol of Knights Panther happens to come down the road, and the knights question both parties. They neither support nor condemn the ‘<em>Sons of Ulric</em>,’ but they ensure that there is no further violence, and allow the Characters to go on their way. They do not, however, involve themselves in any disputes about stolen property.</p>\n<h4>Bandits</h4>\n<p>The forest is a lawless place, and the Characters have already heard that attacks on coaches have increased lately. When the coach encounters a fallen tree across the road, any Character with a clear forward view may attempt a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test to see telltale axe-marks: it was felled on purpose, and as the coach comes to a stop it is surrounded by bandits!</p>\n<p>The numbers and experience of the bandits can vary according to the strength of the party and their travelling companions. Numbers can vary from four or five to a couple of dozen. While the leaders, at least, have a level or two in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.9631KpCQa7jvhmgS]{Outlaw} career, the rest might be local Peasants of various kinds —  or they might be hardened outlaws themselves.</p>\n<p>Instead of outlaws, the bandits might be unemployed mercenaries with @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.FgVH1pPS9oRq0o2Z]{Soldier} and/or other Warrior careers, and banditry may be their way of ‘living off the land’ as they make their way eastward toward Ostland and Talabecland, where the threat of war is looming.</p>\n<p>Most bandits are content to rob their victims of anything valuable or useful, but anyone who looks as though their family is well-to-do — the two daughters of a prosperous Altdorf wool merchant, for example — may be taken prisoner, and their companions sent back to the family with a ransom demand.</p>\n<h4>Beastmen</h4>\n<p>Human bandits are one of the milder threats lurking in the forest. Beastmen are a more savage foe altogether: they certainly kill everyone they encounter, and they are likely to eat them too.</p>\n<p>A Beastman force consists mainly of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.R37OtN5gmPWCYOP3]{Gors}, with a few @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.vrYs3cbxvXtre6rv]{Ungors}. The leader might be a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.cHVOdcEkuatqjYV1]{Bray-Shaman}, or a powerful warrior such as a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.cAK1bMj1ne7HPcxI]{Minotaur} or a Bestigor with an especially powerful set of combat-related Traits and mutations.</p>\n<p>Beastmen might fell a tree or resort to some similar subterfuge to stop a passing vehicle, or they might simply burst from the trees and attack — targeting the horses first so that their victims cannot escape.</p>\n<p>More on coaches and combat can be found in the <strong>Enemy in Shadows Companion</strong>.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[LsUklap1rbMtM7RO]{The Place of Shining Rock}</p>\n<h4>Witch Hunters</h4>\n<p>With reports of anti-Sigmarite violence on the rise in Middenland, the witch hunters of various Sigmarite orders are particularly active on the road, questioning refugees and hunting for the Sons of Ulric and other miscreants. As the Characters learn along the way, one group of witch hunters was recently active in Middenheim, where they burned 17 accused cultists.</p>\n<p>A mounted band of witch hunters might have set up a roadblock, stopping traffic in both directions and questioning all aboard. This might be uncomfortable for any Characters who do not worship Sigmar, as well as for those who do so quietly, with no outward display of Sigmarite emblems such as hammer pendants. Of course, the very things that may convince Sigmarite witch hunters of a Character’s innocence also ensure that an encounter with the Sons of Ulric is far from pleasant.</p>\n<h4>Road Wardens</h4>\n<p>With so much lawlessness on the road, the Imperial Road Wardens are active too. They are patrolling more frequently and in greater numbers, and the Characters and their companions might be stopped anywhere along the road or questioned at an inn where they have stopped for the night.</p>\n<p>The Characters may have to convince the Road Wardens that they are innocent travellers engaged on legitimate business — but given the increase in traffic bound to Middenheim’s Carnival, and their cargo addressed to a recipient in the city by a reputable and well-known mercantile house, this should not be terribly difficult.</p>\n<p>A more serious problem may arise if the Characters run into a press gang. It is well known that both the Road Wardens and the River Patrol have been recruiting aggressively in recent months, and an inn is the perfect spot for a less-than-honest recruiting ploy known as ‘<em>The Emperor’s Shilling</em>’. While his fellows engage the Characters in conversation  — being careful to find out their names and home towns — one Road Warden slips a shilling into each of their ale-mugs. If they drink, they are held to have accepted the shilling — and therefore the Emperor’s offer of employment — under an ancient law. Whether they like it or not, they are now Road Wardens and can be taken into the service by force, if necessary. Some taverns provide tankards with glass bottoms, so that a customer can check for coins before drinking, but understandably the press gangs avoid such establishments.</p>\n<p>If they find themselves ‘impressed’, as the process is called, the Characters have chances to escape, but the Road Wardens already have their names and home towns, which can be circulated around the service on a list of deserters.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/refugees.webp","folder":"9l20ogJKAnhkPnIw","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":300000}}}
{"_id":"LCcPyEiTgkfDUkH2","name":"Shrine of the Shining Rock","content":"<p>The party will reach the Place of Shining Rock the next day.</p>\n<p>The road is still passing through dense woodland but there is a clear side-turning, with a large white boulder to mark it.</p>\n<p>On one side of the boulder is carved the symbol of Ulric; on the other is the symbol of Sigmar - or what remains of it. It is defaced, someone has scrawled 'remember Bosel' on it.</p>\n<p>Half a mile down the turning is an open area of flattish rocky ground, an acre or two across. In the middle of it is a simple yet elegant building. It is larger than a normal wayside shrine, and in fact not unlike the temples typically found in larger villages: about forty feet long, and rising at one end to a low tower. A river runs along one side of the area, and beyond it the forest continues. On the edge of the clearing, next to the river and about seventy yards from the shrine itself, is an￾other building: smaller, lower and more functional, with shut￾tered windows.</p>\n<p>The area is not empty. Six men and seven horses stand around, as if waiting for something or someone. Both men and mounts are armoured, and wear the insignia of Knights of the Order of the Fiery Heart, Sigmarite Templars. As the PCs approach, they come to attention warily. One steps forward and asks them what their business is.</p>\n<p>The Templars are here as the escort of the High Capitular of the Order of the Silver Hammer, Volkmar von Hindenstern. As the adventurers may have gathered or worked out from rumours, he has been visiting the High Priest of Ulric in Middenheim for an emergency meeting to discuss the recent resurgence of belief in the Sigmarian Heresy and the danger posed by the Sons ofUlric, before the conference in Altdorf takes place.</p>\n<p>The visit, while not exactly secret, has been kept low-profile.</p>\n<p>Now on his way back to Altdorf, Volkmar has stopped at the shrine, partly to pay his respects, to make offerings and pray, and partly as a gesture of appeasement to show that there is no tension between the two religions as far as he is con￾cerned. The Place of Shining Rock is an important symbol of the way that the two faiths can hold conflicting beliefs with￾out arguing about them, and he hopes that visiting the shrine will help in some way to restore harmony between the Sigmarians and the Ulricans - if not in the form of a divine answer to his prayers, then at least some good reactions once news spreads that he has made offerings here.</p>\n<p>Even though the news of this stop-off on the High Capitular's journey has been kept quiet so far, the Templars who are escorting him are aware of the potential threat of ambush, especially from rogue Ulricans. Therefore they are extremely wary of strangers, heavily armed ones in particu￾lar, and they are reluctant to discuss their business here.</p>\n<p>If the PCs say they are pilgrims or that they wish to enter the shrine, two Templars will move to block the main door. Their leader explains that a private ceremony is presently going on, and they will have to wait their turn -no more than an hour or three. No amount of questions will reveal who is inside, or what the private ceremony is. or who the Knights are. All the Templars are polite but unhelpful, and will refuse to return the shard to the shrine or deliver the letter for the PCs. If any move is made to force a way into the shrine the Templars will interpret it as an attack on the safety of the Grand Theogonist, will draw swords and will fight to the death, or until some kind of truce or cease-fire is called.</p>\n<p>HOUSES OF THE HOLY</p>\n<p>The party may decide that the priests will be more help than the Templars, and may go over to their dwelling. It's at the edge of the clearing, a single-storey wood-framed structure with a steep planked roof and a chimney.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brother Erasmus is there part of the entourage.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Returning the Shard</strong></p>\n<p>Lose d3 Corruption Points</p>\n<p>If you have no Corruption points, you gain that many uses of a miracle of choice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Sons' Plan</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beate engages with the knights using blather, trying to start an argument/brawl to create a distraction.</li>\n<li>Team 1 enters the priest's lodgings and subdues priests.</li>\n<li>Team 2 breaks into shrine and attempts to kidnap Volkmar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Beate Moser vs Knights</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is a devout ulrican no longer allowed to pray at the shining rock just because a sigmarite lapdog got here first?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was sacred to the teutogens long before Sigmar was even born.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do we have to bow and scrape before these latecomers and legend thieves?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even your Ar Ulric agrees that Sigmar is a god.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He is not my Ar Ulric.

{"_id":"LQ2w4wBqLqxjQxsh","name":"The Cult of Ulric, God of War","content":"<p><strong>Seat of Power</strong>: Middenheim, Middenland</p>\n<p><strong>Head of the Cult</strong>: Ar-Ulric</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Orders</strong>: Order of the Howling Wolf, Order of the Knights of the White Wolf</p>\n<p><strong>Major Festivals</strong>: Campaign Start, Hochwinter, Campaign End Popular Holy Books: Liber Lupus, Teutognengeschichte, The Ulric Creed</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Holy Books</strong>: <em>L</em><em>iber Lupus, Teutognengeschichte, The Ulric Creed</em></p>\n<p><strong>Common Holy Symbols</strong>: White Wolves, stylised ‘U’s, claws</p>\n<p>Ulric is the ferocious God of Wolves, Winter, and Warfare. He is the brother of Taal and, according to Ulrican lore, the king of the gods, although other cults dispute this. He is normally portrayed as a massive, heavily bearded barbarian wearing a white wolf-pelt cloak, and bearing a mighty war-axe named Blitzbeil. He’s a distant, harsh, and unforgiving god who expects his cultists to rely on individual strength and prowess. He despises weakness, cowardice, and trickery, and favours the direct approach in all matters.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Ulric’s cult is strongest in the north of the Empire. The city-state of Middenheim, with its enormous high temple to Ulric, is the heart of his cult, and the god is regarded as the city’s patron. Elsewhere, he is worshipped mainly by warriors and soldiers. Devout Ulricans can usually be spotted by their long hair and beards, for most choose not to cut it, imitating their wild deity. Ulric’s cult is split into just two orders: the priestly Howling Wolves, and the templar White Wolves. The Howling Wolves are not very popular outside Middenland and Nordland, viewed by most folk to be too coarse for this enlightened era. By comparison, the Knights of the White Wolf are enormously popular, easily the largest knightly order in the Empire, and the oldest templar order in the Old World. Ulric’s priests wear black robes with a howling white wolf emblem on the chest. A wolf pelt across the shoulders is also common, as is fur trimmings.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Ulric’s high temple is in Middenheim, and the cult’s leader, Ar-Ulric (which means the son of Ulric), has enormous temporal and spiritual sway. At the back of the high temple lies the Flame of Ulric, a huge, ever-burning, argent fire granted by the winter god to guide his people. This miracle is the focus of several pilgrimage routes, and all Ulricans of Middenland are expected to bathe in its cold light at least once in their lives. Smaller temples are found in every city and town of any size, but are grander and more numerous in the north than in the south. Chapels and shrines can be found in barracks and forts throughout the Old World.</p>\n<p>Temples resemble fortified keeps and are normally square. The interior of the main hall is lit by small windows high in the walls, and by an ever-stocked fire in a circular hearth tended by the priesthood. Behind the fire, usually against a rear wall, stands a statue of Ulric enthroned, often flanked by a pair of enormous wolves. Shrines are similar but smaller, with a lamp in place of a fire and small statues just a foot or two tall.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances set by Ulric are almost always tests of strength, courage, and martial skill.

If so, they are going to be disappointed.</p>\n<p>The shrine is off the road, and the coach only stops there by request: it takes an hour to walk from the highway to the shrine. If they stop there it may be a day or more before they can get a coach to Middenheim. With an urgent package to deliver, their schedule simply does not give them the time.</p>\n<p>The GM can drop a hint that things are different this time. The coach suddenly pulls off to the side of the road to allow a double column of mounted knights to pass, headed for Altdorf. They bear the insignia of the Sigmarite Order of the Fiery Heart. A very grand coach bearing the insignia of the cult of Sigmar and the personal arms of the Grand Theogonist is in their midst. The procession speeds by, and no one is interested in talking to other travellers.</p>\n<p>At their next stop, the Characters may hear the inn staff and fellow guests talking excitedly about the Grand Theogonist, whose retinue took over the inn the previous night. They may hear that he visited the shrine on the way home, and learn a little about its significance. </p>\n<p>If the GM is feeling especially cruel, the Characters may hear how the Sons of Ulric tried to attack the Grand Theogonist, but were defeated by the Templars of his escort with the help of some passing adventurers: <em>‘Sent there by a monk, they were — something about a relic that needed returning.

Weaponless — this was before Sigmar received his hammer Ghal Maraz, and Ulric had lost his sword in the previous battle — he was ambushed, and picked up a strange rock to ward off his attackers’ blows. One blow shattered it, leaving a long, wickedly sharp shard in the god’s hand: with it, he killed five hundred enemies before they fled. A shrine was built around the rock, and has become a place of pilgrimage for both religions — as well as the site of regular arguments about which has the better claim to it.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"9l20ogJKAnhkPnIw","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":400000}}}

{"_id":"M8a3T91oq6cGCR7M","name":"Social Status and Standing","content":"<p>The rules regarding @JournalEntry[uOqWtxfjRN3BfC2z]{Status} are an incredible tool for building context and theme in your Campaigns. A Character’s Status often says more about their world than Class or Career, as it shapes their likely peers, living arrangements, and the logistics of their everyday lives. The following pages are set aside to expand those rules and give advice on how to use them.</p>\n<h3>Costs of Living</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[5gvMwgLgn3fAW3VM]{The Cost of Living} states that a Character is expected to spend approximately half their Status and Standing every day to maintain appearances, and that even this exorbitant amount is considered ‘frugal living.’ </p>\n<p>Whilst this number seems potentially prohibitive for Brass and Silver Statuses, when it comes to Gold Status, it is outright extortionate! And yet, these numbers reflect a very real situation for transient people, such as Warhammer Characters.</p>\n<p>Firstly, it’s worth remembering that a Character doesn’t begin to lose Standing until they’ve spent a week living beneath their expected expenses. However, recovering Standing requires this spending every single day for a week to regain one point. It’s easier to maintain a facade than to build one.</p>\n<p>These systems are in place to create an urgency to adventure. The Characters are not typical examples of their Careers, but rather desperate and extraordinary. Their lives exist in a state of constant change that few in the Empire enjoy (or suffer) by virtue of being the focus of our attention at the table. This need to spend money constantly results in a need to earn money — a lot of money — frequently as well, meaning Characters are more likely to take risks, bet on the wrong Middenball team, involve themselves in shady business, and meet dramatic fates. That is one of the central tensions built into the Warhammer world, and one of your greatest tools to exploit when building adventures.</p>\n<h3>Changing Status</h3>\n<p>A Character’s Standing is often in flux, and the folk of the Old World change their Standing often — by the whims of the Gods, the seasons, and through hard work. But changing one’s Status is rather perilous. It is a fundamental threat to the social order of the Empire. The growing middle class directly threatens the existence of the nobility, and in turn the place in the pecking order of favoured peasants. As such, few people look kindly on social climbers, and there is often a host of issues that comes along with increasing or decreasing one’s Status.</p>\n<p>As the GM, it’s your job to reinforce the central conflicts in the Warhammer world, and one of the starkest is the class struggle that underpins everything in the Empire. To reinforce this, consider not just how NPCs not of a Character’s current Status perceive them, but also those of their new and old Statuses after changing Careers. Old friends may now regard the Characters as out of touch or snobby, whilst new peers may see them as uppity or possibly admirable — having ‘pulled themselves up by their bootstraps’. Characters who drop Status may find themselves surrounded by people who consider the Character ‘too big for their britches’, and other such derogatory phrases.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that the Empire, despite how it might seem, is steadfastly not a meritocracy — that is, the best person for the job isn’t always, or even often, the one who fills it. Privilege is everywhere in the Empire, and no one gets to high places alone. Consider who around the Characters may resent them for their rise (small as it may be), or who see them as their own ticket up the social ladder. Use these class struggles as an opportunity for the world to change around the Characters, and in turn for the Character to change their world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Options: Transitional Status</span></h3>\n<p><em>Changing Status and Standing in the Old World is more difficult than merely finding a new job. To reflect this, you might have achieving new Status and Standing be a gradual process, counting a Career’s stated Status and Standing as its upper limit, rather than its new default.</em></p>\n<p><em>When a Character changes Careers, the Status and Standing of their new Career is their upper limit, rather than their new default, with their current Status and Standing remaining where it was. Characters must act according to the rules laid out in @JournalEntry[uOqWtxfjRN3BfC2z]{Keeping Up Appearances} to raise their Status to its new maximum.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Tapping Communities</h3>\n<p>A Character’s peers are often the first place they’ll want to go to find out information about their current Adventures, future opportunities, or just general gossip. As such, it’s a good idea to create a small cast of NPCs in any locale that the Characters will spend their time in who reflect the attitude and temperaments of the three Statuses. These NPCs can act as the mouth-pieces of their communities, as well as key contacts for the Characters as they inhabit those spaces. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, if a locale includes members of certain restricted classes — represented through the Etiquette Talent — they should have their own NPC. Consider how these NPCs may overlap: perhaps a village has three NPCs of each Status, and two Criminal NPCs, one Brass and one Gold. What does this say about the nature of crime in the community? What does this mean for the Characters moving through it?</p>\n<p>Encourage your Players to have their Characters consort primarily with their own communities, and then come together to share that knowledge. Each community will have different things they know about, care about, and can act on. Gold NPCs may be able to manipulate the courts or local State Army, whilst Servant communities likely have more personal noble gossip — because they spend so much time with nobles, who barely notice that they exist.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>‘We Don’t Serve Your Kind’</em></h3>\n<p><em>Whilst upper class types might think they rule the Old World, the realities of the Empire’s cities and towns is far different. It’s certainly true that a Brass Status individual would have a hard time getting into a palace, a Gold Status patron might find themselves uncomfortable in a seedy docker’s pub.</em></p>\n<p><em>In this way, places and situations can have a Status as well, and even have an @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette} Social Group attached to them, though these are only reserved for special scenes. When present, any NPCs who match the location’s Status count as being subject to a @JournalEntry[4cRhTRnXFqMf90Bs]{Psychology} against non-members.</em></p>\n<p><em>If the space includes an Etiquette that the Character lacks, count their Status as one step removed, in either direction, for the purposes of the above.

{"_id":"MKeb88CBQN7kmMIp","name":"Initial Inquiries: The Purple Hand","content":"<p>If the Characters survive the initial ambush by Purple Hand cultists (see @JournalEntry[ggeBjJcnBuIzFcGw]{‘A Purple Hand Welcome’}), there are no further organised attacks: once the Carnival starts, the cult’s leadership is preoccupied with the plot to take over Middenheim. Even so, there is always a chance that, at some point during the adventure, a Purple Hand cultist may recognise ‘Lieberung’. There is a moment of eye contact; a startled expression; perhaps a hand signal, different from any the Characters have seen before and meaning ‘report to the leaders’ — and then the cultist tries to melt into the crowd. The Characters may try to follow or capture this individual (see @JournalEntry[BRFG82wEhR3OCLzW]{‘Crowds’}), but this will not be an easy task.</p>\n<p>If the Characters succeed, they may learn the location of a Purple Hand safe house, and possibly capture one or two cultists — but these will be low-ranking individuals who know only the three or four fellow members of their cell, and the fact that they have been ordered to cease all other activity — including the effort to recover ‘Lieberung’ — and concentrate their efforts on increasing popular support for the new taxes.</p>\n<p>At the GM’s option, a captured cultist can fill in a few details that the Characters missed from earlier adventures: Lieberung’s high rank within the cult, his promise to hand over the inheritance, and the meanings of any cult signs that the Characters may ask about. </p>\n<p>However, the rank and file does not know that Wasmeier is one of their own — one of their leaders in fact — nor any details of his plot beyond the fact that the new taxes are very important to the cult’s leaders.</p>\n<p>Low-level cultists  do not know the name @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard von Wittgenstein}, but they may know that a Slaanesh cult is active in the city. An exceptionally well informed cultist may know that this cult is called the Jade Sceptre, and that it recruits mainly among the city’s idle and wealthy youth. The two cults are rivals but not enemies, and have taken no overt action against each other: the Jade Sceptre seeks only pleasure, while the Purple Hand seeks power, and already has members in high places — although their identities are not known to the cult’s rank and file.</p>\n<h3>Something Big</h3>\n<p>One unexpected result of interrogating a captured cultist might be the news that the Magister Magistri, the cult’s supreme leader, has ordered all operations to stop during Carnival week: this includes the capture of Kastor Lieberung.</p>\n<p>No one knows why — it is not for the rank and file to question the Magister’s orders — but there have been rumours within the cult that something very big is planned. The captured cultist’s whole cell was ordered to keep a low profile until further orders, and do nothing except to continue supporting the new taxes as vocally as they can. Note: this has been a general order since the taxes were first proposed a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>This revelation may lead the Characters to suspect that the Purple Hand is behind the new taxes somehow, and even that the taxes play a role in the mysterious ‘big plan’ that comes to fruition during Carnival week. This should motivate them to start investigating the taxes (see @JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{‘The Taxes’}).</p>\n<p>Enterprising players may go further, and decide that any vocal supporter of the taxes is a potential Purple Hand cultist. If the Characters are careful, and look for purple items of clothing to help confirm their suspicions, they may be able to capture a few more low-ranking cultists, but they won’t be able to add anything to what the Characters already know.</p>\n<p>Of course, not everyone who vocally supports the new taxes is a cultist, and incautious Characters may discover that they have captured various other kinds of people, and possibly brought other forms of trouble on themselves. Innocent Middenheimers won’t hesitate to go to the Watch with a complaint if they escape or are freed; clerks and scribes from the Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation will do likewise, and the news of their ordeal will also reach the ears of Gotthard Wallenstein (see below), who will plot reprisals; Sons of Ulric are likely to return with a large number of muscular and determined friends to teach the out-of-towners a potentially fatal lesson; and so on. After a few problematic incidents, the Players probably decide that the best way to track down the Purple Hand is by investigating the taxes themselves.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE KASTOR LIEBERUNG GAMBIT</em></h3>\n<p><em>By now, the Characters have had plenty of time to develop a deep-seated enmity with the Purple Hand. If the Character who resembles Kastor Leiberung is still alive, they in particular are likely to have suffered from this association with the Magister. However, while this resemblance was a liability throughout Enemy in Shadows and Death on the Reik, the city of Middenheim presents opportunities for cunning Characters to turn this resemblance to their advantage.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Purple Hand’s organisation (see @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.fKu8IQpLRGcrqtvR]{The Purple Hand}) is obtuse, convoluted, riven with internal machinations, and in some places outright contradictory — all of which pleases Tzeentch greatly. This is something that could work to the Characters’ benefit. The Purple Hand makes an attempt to capture or kill them on their arrival in Middenheim, though during the Carnival most Purple Hand activities will cease, but the cultists will still be encountered either due to the Characters tracking them down, or if the cult sends assassins after the Characters if they become too close to unravelling their plans during Carnival week.</em></p>\n<p><em>One plausible approach for ‘Kastor’ to take would be to convince some of Middenheim’s cultists that, in fact, the bounty put on Kastor Lieberung was related to internal politicking within the Purple Hand, perhaps due to a dispute between the cults leaders in Nuln with those in Middenheim. Most of the cultists are not aware of the grand plan, so this doesn’t risk unravelling the entire plot prematurely. A particularly persuasive ‘Kastor’ may be able to talk some low-level cultists into lending aid, especially if they have had the opportunity to learn some of the cult’s hand signals and terminology. Some prolonged interviews with the cultists might even justify a Character being given the opportunity to take the Talent @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (The Purple Hand)} as though it were a part of their current career. </em></p>\n<p><em>How could the players make use of this? Well, The Purple Hand may well have been monitoring their rivals in The Jade Sceptre, and could possibly guide the Characters in the direction of Gottard Wallenstein. While The Purple Hand does not have any agents close to the Graf who have not already been named, they may well have some lower-ranking members in the palace’s general staff. These could be used to gain access to certain restricted areas, to acquire funds or blackmail material, or even to tip the Characters off to ‘Frau Kenner’ (see @JournalEntry[jepWFu96Qh64OlHw]{The Traitor Unmasked}) and her supply of Ranald's Delight to the Chancellor. They may even provide some muscle on occasion, though the cult’s methods are such that this should make many Characters uncomfortable. It is important, of course, that none of these agents know of Wasmeier’s real identity — you should take care not to tie the cult to him in any way. </em></p>\n<p><em>Should this occur, be sure to reinforce the distasteful realities of the Characters counting cultists among their allies. There should be plenty of mentions of terrible acts carried out in the past in Tzeentch’s name, and the hope of similar things happening in the future — and, of course, they’ll be looking forward to Kastor being there to join in, as well.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE HEIGHT OF FASHION</em></h3>\n<p><em>As the Characters navigate the highs and lows of Middenheim society, they are certain to be on the lookout for The Purple Hand’s signature fashion choice — that of wearing a single item of purple clothing. This ensures that  all cultists  recognise each other in public. Of course, not everyone who likes a purple hat, indigo coin pouch or raspberry sash is a cultist, so this is an excellent opportunity to play on your Characters’ paranoia. Anytime you need to describe an NPC’s appearance, use the table below to generate a random item of purple clothing if you wish to sow a little unease.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">@Table[purple-hand-clothing]</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"Evbhh3cOQ21VdDSM","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 4: Initial Inquiries","sort":200000}}}

{"_id":"MmDAwVCAfBNoh4Zo","name":"The Skulls","content":"<p>If the PCs have behaved intelligently they should find themselves hired to deal with the problem of the skulls soon after reaching the village. The PCs have two days after arriving before the start of the harvest is due, and until this time the villagers have no real need to venture beyond the boundary. If the skull problem still remains, villagers will not work the vineyards unless guarded by a personal escort: their livelihood may suffer but it’s better than being killed. Even if the PCs are willing and able to guard the villagers it will have little effect as far as the harvest is concerned, since without migrant workers (scared off by rumours and the skulls west and east), the amount of grapes harvested will be negligible.</p>\n<p>The militia, led by Parzival, is at the PCs’ disposal. However, unlike their leader, they harbour no desire to go skull-hunting.</p>\n<p>Parzival will therefore instruct them to maintain a watch along the village boundary. Parzival will be all too eager to engage the skulls.</p>\n<p>The adventurers will probably form three objectives: gaining information about attacks (dealt with previously), trying to capture a skull, and attempting to locate where they are coming from. The last two are dealt with below.</p>\n<h2>Capturing a Skull</h2>\n<p>This is not an easy task. The initial problem is that there is simply nothing to capture. Over the last month or so, only four sightings have occurred (plus the one which wrecked the coach). Like it or not, the PCs will have to wait for a skull to come to them. Beating the undergrowth around Maubast is unlikely to have any effect.</p>\n<p>Unknown to the PCs, the skulls are following a timetable laid down by Dieter. Most of the last months’ sightings have been the results of Dieter’s experiments in control; moving, hiding, watching, following, and attacking. The attack on Erietta marked the end of Dieter’s experiments. After the attack, Dieter had the skull return to inspect it for damage. Having done this Dieter sent skulls to take up positions north, west, and east of the village. These will be in position by approximately 3:00 pm in the afternoon following the attack on Erietta (i.e., the day the PCs arrive), and are discussed in the Timetable of Events. Sightings of further skulls will depend on Dieter’s timetable and any activity on the part of the PCs.</p>\n<p>Assuming the party has a skull in sight then it can be captured just like any other creature. However, if the skull is fighting, PCs will need to use a net or something similar since it is not possible to simply grab hold of one (just as it’s not possible to grab hold of someone’s sword arm). Various skills may be tried and the GM should consider each on its merits. It’s not impossible to capture a skull, but neither is it like catching a ball.</p>\n<h2>Using a Captured Skull</h2>\n<p>Skulls cannot be interrogated but may come in useful nevertheless.</p>\n<p>The behaviour of a captured skull depends on its state. If active the skull will do whatever Dieter tells it. If passive the skull will keep on trying to carry out its last instructions. If the skull is in a dormant state, the PCs may make use of its orientation ability (say by using it as a compass or by putting it on a lead), or attempt to gain control (and perhaps use it to follow other skulls). Further details are provided in the Bestiary. However, the villagers will not be too happy at the prospect of a magical skull, no matter how tame, flying around the village.</p>\n<p>If Perrin approaches within 5 yards of a dormant skull it will sense his bit of warpstone and try to move towards it. If it’s able to move, the skull will fly slowly up to Perrin (who will watch in fascination), and then snuggle up to him like a pet cat, getting as close to the warpstone as possible.</p>\n<h2>States</h2>\n<p>A skull may be in one of four states.</p>\n<p><strong>Active:</strong> Whenever the controller is in direct command, its eye sockets glow bright red. Its controller can see through its eyes, but not hear. Active control of a skull requires concentration, which is broken if the controller is disturbed in any way; the skull then switches to passive mode, and seeks to carry out the last command it was given or, at the GM’s option, return to its controller.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive:</strong> When the skull is carrying out instructions out of sight of its controller, or when its controller is in direct control of another skull, its eyes dim noticeably. When it completes its most recent orders, it becomes dormant.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormant:</strong> When a skull is not under direct control and has no orders to carry out, its eyes do not glow. It seeks to return to the cave immediately; if unable to do so, it simply orients itself to face the cave. A successful<strong> Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test while moving a captive skull permits the Characters to notice this phenomenon. If a localised source of Chaos (say, a small fragment of warpstone) is brought within five yards of a dormant skull, it orients to that instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Dead:</strong> When the skull reaches 0 Wounds or has been away from a source of Chaos (the cave, a piece of warpstone, or anything else the GM chooses) for more than 24 hours, it simply becomes a normal skull.</p>\n<h2>Tracking a Skull</h2>\n<p>Although the skulls do not travel fast, they are able to fly, which makes conventional use of the Follow Trail skill impossible. Their ability to fly and small size allows them to lose themselves in the forest fairly easily. Under no circumstances will Dieter’s lair be discovered by chance; the area to search is too big and the cave entrance too well hidden for that to happen. Inventive PCs may work out various plans to follow a skull and the GM must again judge each on its merit. The skulls have a Flying Movement 8 and they never tire, so they are difficult to follow for long distances.</p>\n<p>Characters running full-tilt in the forest must make a Challenging (–10%) Agility Test every round to avoid tripping over roots, smashing into low branches, and so on. Characters that fail fall down and must use the stand action to regain their feet. Such delays cost precious time and likely allow the skulls to escape.</p>","folder":"jsAKzmzu9XIh3Q9e","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

In Altdorf at this time a dealer must be a paid-up member of the Apothecaries&rsquo; Guild in order to supply the drug, as the Watchmen will know on a successful <strong>Lore (Law)</strong> Skill Test.</p>\n<p>Bruno has a few friends in the bar who rely on him to supply their own habits, so this scene is a good opportunity for a fight.</p>\n<h2>Gossip in the bar</h2>\n<p>There is a hubbub of conversation going on in the Mermaid, and whilst some of it will die down when the Watch enter they may be able to spark up a bit of a conversation with customers on a <strong>Difficult (-10) Gossip</strong> Skill Test.</p>\n<p><em>&bull; Hieronymus Juniper keeps on coming in &lsquo;ere bothering our Petal &lsquo;e does, claims he&rsquo;s checking that she&rsquo;s being looked after properly, but I reckon &lsquo;e&rsquo;s just got a fancy for &lsquo;er is all.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; I seen some posters showing them ratmen on them I have, just put up freshly this morning, round the corner by the square.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; Trouble, ain&rsquo;t been trouble in &lsquo;ere for a while.

They will also moan that only last week a Watch patrol came into the tavern and broke up a brawl, causing more damage than the brawlers did. Hans and Hans know nothing but Petal will be more helpful. It was she who tipped the Watch off in the first place. However she is frightened of</p>\n<p>repercussions and will have to be reassured that she will be looked after if anything goes wrong.</p>\n<p>Anyone who can read<strong> Secret Signs (Thief) </strong>will notice that &ldquo;Bruno is the dream dealer&rdquo; is scratched on a chalk slate next to a darts board if they pass a Perception Skill Check.</p>\n<p>If the Watch conduct a search of the staff they will find half a dozen chunks of wierdroot on Bruno on a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Skill Test.</p>\n<p>Should they then try to arrest him Bruno will try to fight his way out. He will have Faustmann on his side and three customers will help him out too.</p>\n<p>Wertha and Gebhard will not try to help Bruno but they will try to defend the tavern from any damage. Gebhard will keep the fight covered with a Blunderbuss and scream regularly for people to calm down.</p>\n<p>Hans and Hans will run for cover whilst Petal hides in the kitchen. She may help out in a slapstick fashion, banging an opponent of the Watch on the head with her frying pan when he is looking the other way, or something.</p>\n<h2>Interrogating Bruno</h2>\n<p>Should the Watch ask Bruno if he has any information on Hugo have them make an <strong>Intimidate</strong> Skill Test, if it is passed Bruno will tell them that the last time he came in the halfling was in the company of a man with fair hair wearing a black leather waistcoat.</p>\n<p>Asked if he recalls anything more about the man Bruno will let them know he had a very irritating laugh and that he laid a sheaf of papers down on the bar when he was there (Draygo&rsquo;s pad of reporter&rsquo;s notes). He also notes that recently he has seen him again, he came into the bar again looking for some cheap smoking weed, and he carried an instrument, some sort of large wooden horn. This didn&rsquo;t strike Bruno as odd, as all sorts of entertainers are taking advantage of Altdorf&rsquo;s music week to earn a few extra shillings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

{"_id":"NFzckQwGMWvvhEUy","name":"The Cult of Ranald, God of Trickery","content":"<p><strong>Seat of Power</strong>: None officially</p>\n<p><strong>Head of the Cult</strong>: None officially, though rumours persist of a cult leader marked with ten crosses </p>\n<p><strong>Primary Orders</strong>: The Crosses, the Brotherhood, the Crooked Fingers</p>\n<p><strong>Major Festivals</strong>: The Day of Folly</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Holy Books</strong>: <em>The Riddles Ten, Midnight and the Black Cat, The Great Joke</em></p>\n<p><strong>Common Holy Symbols</strong>: Crossed fingers, Cats, Magpies</p>\n<p>According to myth, Ranald was once mortal, a gentle bandit who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. This so charmed Shallya that the goddess fell in love. One fateful day, she found Ranald dying, fatally touched by the plagues of the Fly Lord. Unable to accept this, she let Ranald drink from her holy chalice, granting the rogue eternal life. But it was all a trick — Ranald had faked it all — and, laughing, the new god gleefully danced into the heavens. While generally portrayed as a dapper Human wearing a perpetual smile, there is little consistency to the height, weight, skin colour, or even gender of Ranald, though the god is more commonly portrayed as male in the Empire. More a cheerful trickster than outright criminal, Ranald is said to have a love of deflating pride with clever tricks and ruses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Ranald most commonly stands as a patron to thieves and rogues, but the cult also attracts gamblers, liars, merchants, tricksters, and the poor and downtrodden.</p>\n<p>The cult of Ranald is, by general perception, a disorganised rabble of charlatans, thieves, and ne’er-do-wells. However, it is more co-ordinated than it appears, and split into three primary orders. The Crosses are the most accepted — a priesthood overseeing the cult’s gambling-dens, typically using the proceeds to administer to the poor. The Brotherhood is less open, and is somewhat akin to a secret society of merchants — they use business to bring the pompous and greedy to their knees. Lastly, and most widespread, is the publicly disavowed Crooked Fingers, the thieves, rogues, and liars of Ranald, a group that is roundly distrusted.</p>\n<p>Cultists of Ranald have no conventional garb to identify them, but always work cross symbols into their clothing somewhere, perhaps as a repeating pattern.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Ranald has no formal temple organisation, although the cult maintains seemingly unconnected gambling dens in most towns and cities. Small shrines are found in the headquarters of many criminal gangs and merchant houses, and the poorer quarters of many cities have street-corner shrines dedicated to the God of Luck. The latter are often maintained by local ‘shrine clubs’ which operate as both social and religious bodies, and are usually led by one of the Crooked Fingers. Shrines are almost never elaborate, often just a simple, smiling statue with crossed fingers behind the back, or a crudely depicted cat or magpie, often fashioned as if smiling.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Ranald’s penances usually involve stealing into locked and guarded locations to recover precious items or leave a token of their presence. Humiliating oppressors of the poor is also common — perhaps by framing a brutal Watch captain for a ludicrous crime, for example, or locking him in his own cells. Ranald often sends favoured and disfavoured cultists alike on a ‘Pilgrimage of Fingers’, a set of tasks proving capability and loyalty.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Strictures</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>One coin in ten belongs to Ranald.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never betray another to the authorities; there is no greater sin than informing.</em></li>\n<li><em>Violence is prohibited except in self-defence.</em></li>\n<li><em>It is better to live free and die than live under oppression.</em></li>\n<li><em>There is no honour among thieves, but there is amongst Ranaldans.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.FElNQGNiPzaOwwKT]{Blessing of Charisma}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.OkKWAfnMiHfxhTnB]{Blessing of Finesse}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iIfYOlNrLb0uiV8c]{Blessing of Fortune}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tMocig1z9dHKNiCT]{Blessing of Wit}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.1MUSq1xRyHCaIuAL]{An Invitation}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Bo3ukcaipFNb7Ljl]{Cat's Eyes}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.hL7B3d7A0sYYjHXn]{Ranald's Grace}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.QSwJNH8sotKjtdi4]{Rich Man, Poor Man, Beggar Man, Thief}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.FfGboPdR54WHtkAE]{Stay Lucky}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.fABd17NZvg2uUReL]{You Ain’t Seen Me, Right?}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/ranald.webp","folder":"NkiXlTQtgNkW3FMs","sort":600001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief","sort":600001}}}

Depending on the outcome of the conversation, either the Aschaffenbergs or the family of the other noble will be embarrassed.</p>\n<p>A group of GRP protestors break into the reception room, denouncing the nobility and shouting for Ubersreik to be made a free town.

The other does not notice, but if the Characters intervene — or if the noble pulls out his or her handkerchief, causing the object to fall to the ground — it is found to be a note wrapped around a playing card.</p>\n<p>The playing card bears an unspeakably disgusting image that will be easily identified by any Witch Hunter as a reference to Slaanesh, the Chaos God of Depravity. The note reads as follows: Handout Lord Erich is trying to frame one or more of his rivals as members of a secret Chaos cult. The resulting scandal will lead to witch hunters investigating both families, leaving the von Holzenauers as perfect candidates for the lordship of Ubersreik.</p>\n<p>If the Characters challenge Lord Erich and expose his guilt, the von Holzenauers will be investigated instead, and their claim to Ubersreik will be finished.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Death's Tarock - heretical deck of cards depicting the people of the empire as skeletons - the pip cards depicting the peasants and burghers, the court cards being Knight, Baroness, Count, Duchess, and Prince.</p>\n<p>@Item[JQymrGWe1ukFfOVV]{The Skeleton Emperor Card}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[UZvXiZecKefqXfci]{Pocket Note}</p>\n<h2>11:30 p.m.</h2>\n<p>A Skaven Gutter Runner murders a young noble in the garden (Florian Pfeifraucher or Baron Heinrich von Falkenhayn are both good candidates, or another noble of your choice) and hides the body under a bush. The Skaven then sneaks into the house dressed in the victim’s ill-fitting costume, with a hood over its head. It then tries to dump a pouch of powdered Warpstone into the punch bowl. An Opposed Perception/Stealth Test is required to notice anything unusual about this partygoer; most of the other guests pay no attention, being somewhat drunk and involved in their own business. Unless the Skaven is stopped or the spiked punch is thrown away, mutations will start to break within half an hour.</p>\n<p>Characters searching the garden will be able to find the body of the murdered guest on a successful Perception Test. If the Gutter Runner is stopped inside the mansion, it throws a smoke bomb to cover its escape. If it is cornered and cannot escape, it will fight to the death.</p>\n<h2>11:45 p.m.</h2>\n<p>The sounds of a fight are heard from upstairs. Volker Volkmann, Netta’s husband, has surprised her and Doktor Krupp. His hands are locked about the physician’s throat as she stands by screaming for him to stop.</p>\n<p>If the Characters intervene and resolve the situation without bloodshed, Lady Nacht notes this, and the noble House employing them will benefit.</p>\n<h2>Midnight</h2>\n<p>If the PCs have not yet found the body on the garden (see 11:30 above), there is a shout from outside as another guest does so. If the party has not yet been disrupted by an outbreak of mutations, an assistant cook staggers in from the kitchen, clutching his throat with a hand that grows furrier and more wickedly clawed before the company’s eyes. Guests flee in terror and dismay: no one will ever forget this ball or its dreadful aftermath.</p>\n<p>If questioned, the servant will admit to sampling some ale from a new barrel about ten minutes ago. Depending on how cruel you are feeling, the barrel may not yet have been put out for the guests, and mutations are restricted to a handful of kitchen staff — or it may have been sitting on the bar in the dining room for the last five minutes, exposing everyone who drank from it to the Warpstone it contains.</p>\n<p>No matter the case, the breakout of mutation ends the masquerade in panicked embarrassment as witch hunters, the Cult of Sigmar, and the Watch are summoned to investigate what happened.</p>\n<p>If the gravin remains alive, and Baron Eberhardt von Dammenblatz, drunken and enraged, confronts her and the Characters as they leave the party. He is armed with a pistol, and demands immediate satisfaction over the death of his father. He demands the gravin duel him, though she steadfastly refuses. This confrontation draws a crowd of other nobles who all denounce Dammenblatz, though this only serves to make him angrier. If the Characters do not intervene, Dammenblatz shoots the gravin through the heart, killing her, before being subdued to await trial.</p>","folder":"lzflRKyLfHkcsNPL","sort":600000,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

This adventure consists of a number of set scenes. Only @JournalEntry[jb3aJ8BLgyGHPLmG]{The Briefing} needs to be played out first, other scenes are then played out depending on the decisions of the patrol.</p>\n<p>Some scenes are optional, and are to be fitted in if the GM feels the party need a helping hand, or if a violent or investigative scene might improve the pace of the scenario.</p>\n<p>Hopefully by the end of the session the PCs will have amassed enough information to arrest Drago Vedris, a vicious serial killer of Halflings, as well as solving other crimes, keeping the peace in Altdorf and, perhaps, earning a few backhanders.</p>\n<p>The following is a recommended running order for the scenes of the scenario, GMs may find it easier to force the action along in this way, but we encourage you to allow players to decide what leads they wish to follow. If they make progress a little too quickly throw in a couple of petty crimes for them to deal with, such as witnessing a burglary or assault, in order to complicate matters.</p>\n<h2>BEFORE YOU BEGIN</h2>\n<p>Make sure that all the players have read their character information and that all the players have seen the copy of the Altdorf Speiler in the handouts section. The stories in the Speiler are common knowledge around Altdorf at the time of the scenario, so even if the player&rsquo;s characters can&rsquo;t read let them look at the newssheet.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[jb3aJ8BLgyGHPLmG]{The Briefing}</h2>\n<p>Captain Trenker fills the PCs in on the latest cases. From here the patrol could take on the following cases in any order they wish:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@JournalEntry[rJuorWdIjMar3Kdh]{The Case of the Goblin Sighting}</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[MqWOss5hlnG2YY8F]{The Case of the Weirdroot Ring}</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[ZbDsbmx9A22WB2ST]{The Case of the Beaten Bawd}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During these cases the PCs will uncover clues to the other cases; they can also come across the following cases whilst on their rounds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@JournalEntry[QMXMUKqElq4nKmT0]{The Case of the Agitator}</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[WjAqI9KPA8hXSLQk]{The Case of the Halfling Spokesperson}</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[ekuOD5t7AJvJvdvJ]{The Case of the Arrested Noble}</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[5zopWtNNkCYdQ0ow]{The Case of the Upset Tileans}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these have no relevance to the bigger picture, whilst others give extra clues as to other crimes in the city. Hopefully by the end of the game the PCs will have amassed enough info to go about @JournalEntry[ldcldXAuCAVsJ0D3]{Confronting Drago}.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[rJuorWdIjMar3Kdh]{The Case of the Goblin Sighting}</h2>\n<p>The Hooks and the Fish are two of Altdorf&rsquo;s most violent dockside gangs. They are often out to try and discredit one another.</p>\n<p>Recently a member of the Hooks spotted a greenskin in one of the warehouses on the dockfront. This caused some uproar and word spread fast before the leadership of the Hooks decided to be responsible and inform the Watch about what was going on.</p>\n<p>The Fish had stolen the greenskin from a boat carrying supplies and specimens to the</p>\n<p>University of Altdorf. As soon as the Hook who discovered the greenskin ran off they hid it elsewhere, hoping to sow confusion amongst the Hooks, have them loose customers (who don&rsquo;t want to use a greenskin infested warehouse) and discredit them with the Watch.</p>\n<p>The PCs can investigate the warehouse and find clues to the whereabouts of the goblin. This will win them the thanks of the Hooks but the enmity of the Fish. Or they can fail to find anything and move on with the other cases, meaning that neither of the dockside gangs think any differently of them</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[QMXMUKqElq4nKmT0]{The Case of the Agitator}</h2>\n<p>At some stage in their investigations the Watchmen see a young man looking a bit suspicious next to some recently pasted up flyers about the existence of Ratmen. They can attempt to arrest him, leading to a chase, and take him to the station if they catch him. He speaks Tilean and can help them solve @JournalEntry[5zopWtNNkCYdQ0ow]{The Case of the Upset Tileans} (see below).</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[WjAqI9KPA8hXSLQk]{The Case of the Halfling Spokesperson}</h2>\n<p>Heironymous Juniper, a self styled representative of Altdorf&rsquo;s Halfling population, has been appearing regularly and demanding to know how the case is progressing. He sometimes brings along journalists and members of the cult of Verena with him.Trenker has accused him of wasting Watch time&nbsp;and, in turn, Juniper has accused the Watch of institutionalised prejudice against Halflings, and he has threatened to ask Priests of Altdorf&rsquo;s Temple of Verena to take a close look at the matter. He may appear at junctures where the watch party are not busy with a Verenan Investigator in tow, demanding to know what latest leads have been examined in the case of the Pattern Killer.</p>\n<p>He may also appear with a writer for the Altdorf Spieler, who will interview the party.</p>\n<p>Heiro is merely a nuisance character used to waste party time. Some may feel that his interest may conceal a guilty secret, but he has done nothing wrong.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[MqWOss5hlnG2YY8F]{The Case of the Weirdroot Ring}</h2>\n<p>The last victim of the Halfling Pattern Killer was a wierdroot addict, and Captain Trenker has suggested that the Mermaid tavern staff might have supplied the drug based on evidence given by witnesses who saw the victim regularly visit the tavern, but not drink there.</p>\n<p>One of the barmen at the Mermaid has been dealing wierdroot. He will not go without a fight though. He may be able to give them some info about the wierdroot habits of his former customers if beaten into submission.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[5zopWtNNkCYdQ0ow]{The Case of the Upset Tileans}</h2>\n<p>These Tileans are the crew of a vessel who have had a Hobgoblin specimen stolen. They have come to the Watch station to complain, but no one there speaks fluent Tilean. Until the party turn up with someone who can speak Tilean they will hang about trying to communicate in mime or just jabbering amongst themselves.</p>\n<p>They saw distinctly that a man hung about their boat prior to the theft. They can give a description of him. He wore a symbol of a fish stitched to his jerkin.</p>\n<p>They used to have a halfling Burgher/Scribe/ Navigator with them who was their interpreter, but he hasn&rsquo;t been seen since this morning.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[ZbDsbmx9A22WB2ST]{The Case of the Beaten Bawd}</h2>\n<p>Tristran Mahler, a local Bawd with a violent reputation, stumbles into the station covered in blood.</p>\n<p>It seems he has had some merchandise stolen from his warehouse, though he isn&rsquo;t keen to explain where he received his injuries.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[ekuOD5t7AJvJvdvJ]{The Case of the Arrested Noble}</h2>\n<p>In the cells is a noble who has been arrested for assaulting a working girl. He plays no part in the adventure really but is an excuse for some important NPCs to be unavailable in the adventure. If the PCs return to the station they find that many of their superiors are busy trying to, at first, threaten the noble, then, having realised how important he is, attempting to appease him. Later they will be in an office with him and a member of the local Verenan clergy to discuss proper restitution.</p>\n<h2>THE PATTERN KILLER</h2>\n<p>The big story in Altdorf at the moment is that of the Pattern Killer, a man who has slain three halflings whose bodies have been discovered every second Aubentag for the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>The Watch are desperate to catch him, if only to get Hieronymus Juniper off their backs.</p>\n<p>Drago Vedris is the killer. He has abducted a halfling from a Tilean barge and holds it in a bedsit he has hired near the docks, planning his latest fiendish ironic death for the runts he so irrationally despises.</p>\n<p>The party are up against it to gather all the clues they can in order to rescue the victim and bring Drago to justice before the scenario is finished.</p>"}

From at least 2510 IC (two years before the start of the campaign), Blitzen had been carrying on a correspondence on the subject of Skaven with a Doctor Felix Liebkosen of Rugebrunnen in Middenland. Given how carefully the Skaven cover their tracks, they may already be planning the murder of the new professor, and the Characters might find their social or training visit ends with them standing between Hieronymous and a Clan Eshin death squad.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>MASTER AND APPRENTICE</em></h3>\n<p><em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.j3XNhduYwpEeBcOk]{Hieronymous Blitzen's} death was much exaggerated — and in fact, this was entirely by design. During his exchange of letters with Doctor Felix Liebkosen in Middenland, the old Wizard realized that his mail was being intercepted and read. One night a shout from Hans-Peter roused the Wizard from sleep to find his home being ransacked by several unusual thugs. These turned out to be @Actor[DfOuLQkGzWUZPTXI]{Yellow Fang cultists}, and Blitzen was certain more would follow.</em></p>\n<p><em>He has faked his death and come to Middenheim to search for further evidence of the Skaven, for Doctor Liebkosen's letters indicated the city could be a den for the creatures. His relief to find the Characters is palpable, and he quickly attempts to recruit them into his efforts to search for the creatures, especially once he hears of their attack on the inn (see @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{Chaos Strikes by Night}). </em></p>\n<p><em>For his part, Hans-Peter feels veritably dragged to Middenheim, and has no faith that the Skaven exist at all. He presumes the attack from the cultists to be just another chaos cult worshipping beastmen, much like the Red Crown. He wishes to make contant with the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Grand Guild of Wizards} in Middenheim to see if he can find another master to take him on.</em></p>\n<p><em>Some characters may wish to help @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.I9jJAXajLasIuM2b]{Hans-Peter} in this endeavor, if only to be rid of him. Hieronymous would find this terribly distressing, however, as he has come to view the somewhat obnoxious young man in quite a paternal manner.</em></p>\n<p><em>While a full on investigation of the Skaven may distract from the main plot, Blitzen's appearance towards the end of the campaign may feed nicely into the growing presence of the Skaven which will be explored during <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. If the Characters are having trouble making inroads with the High Wizard during their investigation, the more established Hieronymous vouching for them may be of use.</em></p>\n<p><em>Alternatively, the wizard may provide an excellent way to hook the Characters into the events of @JournalEntry[TtjfBS0C0YlVYZBW]{The Ritual}.

The old wizard, while canny, may have been taken by surprise and gagged, rendering his magic useless.</em></p>\n<p><em>It is up to the GM whether Hans-Peter survives @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Peter Taveli's} crossbow bolt.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"l1wMwe07tENDjYkH","sort":-1953,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Familiar Faces","sort":-1953}}}

As an Elector and the head of the Empire’s second largest religion, any mishap which befalls him will have far-reaching consequences. The Graf feels that Ar-Ulric is too concerned with the cult in the Empire and his Electoral position, and neglects Middenheim’s interests.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Ar-Ulric lives in the Inner Palace, and divides his time between there and the @JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{Temple of Ulric}. He also attends many different Carnival events.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Females</strong>:  –10 to all Fellowship Tests. He is anxious and tries to avoid women.</p>\n<p><strong>Priests of Ulric</strong>: +5 to all Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Ar-Ulric knows who influences Graf Boris. He can provide introductions to other NPCs, subject to his relations with them. He believes that only someone powerful would try to blackmail an Elector, but he is too fearful to try to unmask the blackmailer.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>None. Ar-Ulric knows who has the ear of Graf Boris.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Ar-Ulric desperately wants to recover his love letters: if they are returned he will end his affair with @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}, although he still loves her. He is very unhappy about the Temple Tax, feels that the Dwarf Tax is socially divisive, and believes the Scroll Tax will undermine a crucial element of the city’s defence. Forced to defend all the taxes, he does so unconvincingly.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Thinks him cold, aloof, and uncaring, especially about the social effects of taxation. To some extent, this is a projection of his own guilt at being forced to support the tax changes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Hardly knows him, but is aware of his good reputation. They might become friends if they got to know each other.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Hardly knows him, but admires his music. Has no idea that Rallane knows of his affair with Emmanuelle Schlagen, and would be terrified if he found out.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘Princess’:</strong> Doting fondness: she seems responsive to his homilies, and shows a kindly soul.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: Rather intimidating: she is too strict and unforgiving, especially toward the young.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Does not know them.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}:</strong> Neutral: their paths rarely cross.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: For the record, she seduced him. Initially head-over-heels, anxiety is tormenting him now. He still loves her, and would never betray her.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Wonders what they know or suspect. @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle} has told him that she suspects Petra Liebkosen knows about their affair: is she in league with the blackmailer?</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: It is good to see someone as dutiful and ardent, even if he is a pompous fool underneath. Ar-Ulric will neither deride nor defend him, except against the worst insults.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: No dealings: thinks vaguely of him as a good fellow, but knows his high-living reputation.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Has met him briefly and instinctively distrusts him, but in his current turmoil he hardly trusts his instincts any more. Wonders if he might be the blackmailer.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Ar-Ulric and other priests attempted to minister to @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan}, without success: Luigi’s success arouses mixed feelings. Fears that Luigi, with his huge and shameless appetites, might recognise something in Ar-Ulric and guess about the affair. Tries to avoid him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Ar-Ulric knew the introverted Reiner Ehrlich as well as anyone could. If he were not concerned with other matters, he might visit the Law Lord and try to help him with his acute depression.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>While Breugal has never shown the High Priest anything less than the proper respect due to his station, an increasingly guilty conscience has made Ar-Ulric sour and distrustful of the chamberlain. He sees contempt in Breugal’s every gaze and accusation in his every word, completely without justification.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Ar-Ulric doesn’t like Mueller but tolerates her. He finds her offhand manner and her elusive, lawyerly expression as evidence that she’s too clever for her own good. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>He respects her quiet resolve and values her role in the city, even though some of the other Ulrican priests dismiss her as soft. Her recent hostility towards him has proved unsettling.</p>\n<h3>Deadly Secret: Blackmail</h3>\n<p>Obviously, Ar-Ulric will be extremely reluctant to discuss the affair. The Characters must be gentle and subtle, unless they have somehow already managed to recover the letters. Otherwise, Ar-Ulric will be desperate to prevent the Characters learning of his indiscretions; for example, he may try to sidetrack them by saying that @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Wallenstein} is corrupt and should be investigated.</p>\n<p>Very careful and diplomatic play will be required to overcome his fears and build trust; depending on how the Characters approach him, he may let things slip little by little, or he may break down dramatically, confess all, and beg the Characters to help him.</p>\n<p>Ar-Ulric’s affair with @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} began about eight months ago. Two months ago, he received a letter from someone claiming to have his love letters to her. Unfortunately, he destroyed this letter, so the Characters cannot see it — but it contained certain intimate details that could only have come from the letters.</p>\n<p>The next day, one Frau Elise Kaltblutig requested an audience. She showed him one of the letters, and threatened him with scandal and disgrace unless he supported the new taxes. She was somewhat tall (5’ 6” to 5’ 9”); her hooded cloak concealed her build and face, and her speech was stilted, as though she was trying to disguise her true voice. After the taxes took effect, the woman visited again, telling him that the letters would be returned in two months provided he supported the tax changes until then. Elise Kaltblutig is one of @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich’s} many alter egos.</p>\n<p>The Palace guards have no recollection of visitors from so long ago: however, one of them, Josef Gropius, may remember a woman whose name began with ‘K’ — actually Brunhilde Klaglich using another alias, ‘Frau Kenner’ delivering the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor’s} favourite concoction.</p>\n<p>If the Characters recover the letters, Ar-Ulric will help them in their eventual audience with Graf Boris. Until then, he will help as best he can in other ways, such as providing healing and introductions to other major NPCs. His position and official duties do not permit him to accompany them in public, and he will literally swear the Characters to silence by having them take a sacred oath in the @JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{Temple of Ulric}</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Recitals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Horse Fair}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Elven Lightsingers}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<h3>The Ar-Ulric at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>Unless one of the Characters is at least a High Priest of Ulric, or has a career that could plausibly be used to back up a claim that the Character needs to see the high priest on urgent state business, Ar-Ulric  is extremely hard to reach. He attends some of the more cultural Carnival events, but is attended by an escort of half a dozen Teutogen Guards: elite warriors of Ulric drawn from within the Knights of the White Wolf. While the Guards are worried about possible threats to Ar-Ulric from fanatical followers of Sigmar or agents of a treacherous Emperor, the high priest himself is reduced to an almost paranoid state by the threat of blackmail that hangs over him, and the Graf ’s paramour, @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emannuelle Schlagen}. He is suspicious, if not downright terrified, of any stranger who approaches him in public. He is heavily guarded in private.</p>\n<p>While it is possible to engineer a situation in which the Characters can rescue Ar-Ulric from some threat, the Characters are more likely to find themselves flung out of the way by his bodyguard, who handles the situation with brutal efficiency. Any Characters who resist being flung aside find themselves treated as additional threats rather than helpful members of the public.</p>\n<p>The best, and perhaps the only, way to meet with Ar-Ulric on favourable terms is to be introduced by someone he trusts, preferably with a recommendation from @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle}. While the two cannot be too public in their meetings, she can still give the Characters a token which Ar-Ulric recognises, and that reassures him that she trusts the party. Preoccupied as he is with the threat of blackmail, he must be reassured that the Characters can help with this —or, better still, have already neutralised the blackmailer — before he can give his full attention to any stories of plots against the city or threats to the Graf ’s life.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Ar-Ulric can provide relatively few introductions, and will have to trust the Characters implicitly before he does so. The ‘Princess’ and her chaperone would respond well to a letter of introduction furnished by the high priest, and so would any of the @JournalEntry[9QmzxmgtDbdsPiSv]{Midden Marshals}. Introductions to other major NPCs can be handled as you wish, given the circumstances and the relationship between Ar-Ulric and the NPC in question.

{"_id":"O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa","name":"The Village of Pritzstock","content":"<p>Pritzstock is a small but wealthy village of 60 or so adults and children. @Scene[9qBXM8BnsfoP9zEh]{Midddenheim Surrounds} details the local area and @Scene[4Kq88YbabEliQ7Tf]{Pritzstock} shows the village proper. In addition to a farmhouse, each household has a large fermenting shed where workers press grapes and store wine casks. Bottles of the better vintages are usually kept in cellars beneath the houses.</p>\n<p>Livestock is limited to a few pigs, goats, and hens. The latter are allowed to wander freely and spend a lot of their time scratching around the northwest area of the village, since this is where people are buried and the worms grow fat as a result.</p>\n<p>Surrounding the village are vineyards grown on manufactured terraces cleared from the forest; the wine produced provides the sole source of income for the inhabitants. Pritzstock wine has a light, delicate flavour, and is gaining in popularity throughout the Western Empire. In recent years, harvests have been particularly good, and the village has prospered as a result — buildings and carts are in good repair, animals are sturdy, and the people are well fed. </p>\n<p>Surprisingly to some, the village does not have an inn: Pritzstock’s social life takes the form of frequent wine tastings at one house or another. By far the most popular sessions take place at the home of @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe Rocheteau}, the burgomeister.</p>\n<p>The village is at its busiest during the grape harvest, and the timing of this is crucial to the village’s continued prosperity. The grapes must be picked within the next week to produce the best wine. Judging just when to start requires years of experience, and the Characters arrive just two days before the harvest of this year’s crop must begin if the wine is not to be ruined. Migrant workers from the surrounding areas have yet to arrive but some wine merchants from Middenheim and even Altdorf have already visited: the grapes have been assessed, and prospects look good — provided the harvest starts on time.</p>\n<h3>Arriving in Pritzstock</h3>\n<p>The rough track from @JournalEntry[EgezB9BzxKmohox9]{Grubentreich} emerges from the forest to reveal a small valley, intensively cultivated with acre upon acre of healthy-looking vines. If the party is travelling with Hans Krug, they hear a grunt of surprise. It is curious, he says, that nobody is working the vineyards.</p>\n<p>Arriving in the village across a well-maintained but rather inadequate defensive ditch, the Characters might be struck by Pritzstock’s obvious prosperity. A couple of houses have planks nailed across the windows, and large sprays of flowers fixed to the front doors. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Folklore) </strong>Test reveals they are ‘nanny’s fingers’, a local weed thought to ward off evil spirits.</p>\n<p>Following the sound of a hubbub in the distance, the Characters find that all the villagers are meeting outside the house of @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe}. The scene is quite confusing, with many people speaking and shouting at once. Things quiet down when the strangers are spotted, but at this stage the villagers are wary of newcomers, and act accordingly.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of the lull, @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Philippe} speaks.<em> ‘Look, there’s no point arguing until we’ve all calmed down and can talk sensibly, and there’s no sense blaming people without cause.’</em> At this there is a general murmur of dissent, but Henri-Phillippe continues. ‘Everyone go home, and we’ll meet again in a couple of hours.’ This is met with broad approval and the villagers begin to disperse. If the Characters arrived with Krug, the farmer and his two companions continue on their way after a stop at the local store to find out what’s going on.</p>\n<p>Once the meeting is concluded, @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} greets the Characters.</p>\n<h3>Recent Events</h3>\n<p>A day ago a boy named Seel Baldurich came running into the village having seen ‘a ghost’ in the woods (see Sighting 1 on the @Scene[xCHI2UlFpaaUOflT]{Pritzstock Sightings} map. Seel is well known in the village for his tall tales, and this one was put down to imagination. However, a few hours later, Isolde Gudhoffen was out collecting fruit when she noticed a skull sitting on a branch. The skull did not move, but when she returned with volunteers from the militia, the skull had gone (Sighting 2). Again, no one believed her. However, the previous evening two farm workers, Sigismund Halsbret and Knud Grapenpikker, both claimed to have seen a ‘glowing skull’ floating in the woods while out working (Sighting 3). This report was taken seriously, but a full-scale search by the militia failed to reveal any clues.</p>\n<p>Finally, on the morning the Characters arrived, Erietta Surhardt was attacked while working among the vines. Three other workers heard her scream and rushed over to discover her unconscious and bleeding. Worse still, a skull was resting on her body (Sighting 4). The skull took to the air and flew off into the forest. Erietta was carried back and now lies in the Rocheteau house, attended by @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet}. <strong>Note</strong>: If the Characters delayed coming to Pritzstock, feel free to change these exact timings, making sure to keep the relative time between each the same.</p>\n<p>An already frightened village had gathered to ‘do something’ when it was noted that Sigismund Halsbret (one of the witnesses in Sighting 3), was missing. A search of the village has failed to find him, unnerving the villagers further. (Actually, a very scared Sigismund left secretly before dawn. He has no relatives in the village and decided to pack his bags and run.) With the grape harvest due to begin in two days, the villagers are worried about their livelihood: they are frightened to go into the vineyards, and the crop is in danger.</p>\n<p>All the above is common knowledge, but the Characters are likely to obtain a more coherent version from @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Philippe}. Speculation is rife in the village. Here are a few possible rumours, and the GM should feel free to add more.</p>\n<p>The graves of dead warriors from an ancient battle have been disturbed by clearing the forest. Local rumour, based on truth, has it that a Chaos horde from the Drakwald Forest was slain two centuries ago, <em>‘somewhere over to the southwest’</em>. Perhaps some were also slain near Pritzstock?</p>\n<p>The skulls have been sent as a punishment from the gods for not making proper sacrifice in respect of the recent excellent harvests.</p>\n<p>@Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} is somehow involved, scheming to buy everyone’s land cheaply when all the villagers have left or been killed. Who else has the capital to buy so much land?</p>\n<p>The last rumour is the blackest, and is only spoken if things are getting very bad — and if @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} isn’t around.</p>\n<p>The villagers are angry that the militia has not done anything to stop the skulls. Just what the militia (four farmers and a young well-to-do soldier) are supposed to do nobody says, but that does not stop them from complaining.</p>\n<p>Pritzstock has a lot to lose if the harvest does not go ahead on time, and welcomes the Characters as potential rescuers. @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Philippe} offers @Credit[8gc SPLIT]{8 GCs} if the party deals with the skulls before the harvest begins. For each harvest day lost, the reward is reduced by 1 GC. He believes that the skulls have indeed come from some disturbed battlefield, and wonders whether all that is needed is to seal up some tomb entrance to stop the skulls getting out. During their period of hire, the Characters receive free food and drink, and may sleep in the fermenting shed.</p>","img":null,"folder":"O0HfGcMmqK25GSdm","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":400000}}}

Specialising in his Ground Pork and Fig Pies, which he proudly proclaims contain absolutely no rat at all, Roscoe is a popular figure on the quayside, selling to boatman, Fish and Hook alike.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Hans Zweifel is selling fried slices of parsnip flavoured with exotic spice from the sun drenched Islas of Estalia!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Mermaid&rsquo;s a sound tavern.

I just hope he stays there, last thing I need is competition from Sigmar reborn!&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Gunther Schl&auml;ger &ndash; Boatman Association Enforcer</h3>\n<p>A heavy in the Altdorf&rsquo;s Boatman Association, Schl&auml;ger&rsquo;s job is to find any boatmen working the Altdorf docks who are not paid-up members of the association and &lsquo;persuade&rsquo; them to hand over dues. Schl&auml;ger is a brute of a man who grew up in Altdorf&rsquo;s notorious Drecksack Slums, where he learnt the fine arts of gutter fighting and bare knuckle boxing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Verkn&uuml;pfung is a sound trader.

He would swipe from his own mother for a stick of weirdroot.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Schygulla &ndash; Dock Manager</h3>\n<p>Schygulla is an old man who spends his day gossiping about the goings on in the palace while his apprentices do all work. Schygulla used to run with the Hooks and also has strong links to the Luitpoldstrasse Watch, making him in his own way one of the most powerful men in the Niederhafen Bezirk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Typical trick this.

While this is not one of the most populist movements in Altdorf, one of the main planks of her argument is telling bawdy tales that expose the hypocrisy of Magisters on this matter, which always gathers a fair crowd.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;It is so unfair I tell you! If Magister G&uuml;nter Hunold can attend the parties of Michaela von J&auml;nke and engage in unrestrained debauchery, then why cannot my Magnus spend a night with me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Luther Huss is in Altdorf and is to preach upon the subject of Valten&rsquo;s Heroism at the Mallusschmied Palais tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Johan Kyttlie &ndash; Weather Scryer</h3>\n<p>Johan makes his living selling weather forecasts to ship&rsquo;s captains and anyone else who wants one. To do this he employs many traditional Reikland techniques, almost all of which require string, dried fish and a limited ability to call on the Winds of Magic. If questioned, he will stress at length that he is not in fact a Hedge Wizard, and that all of his divination methods are done with science, not magic at all. In common with other Altdorf Weather Scryers, Johan wears tattered robes covered with divination trinkets and carries a copper shod staff with seabird feathers pinned to it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Something is not right, the weather has been wrong for the last two weeks and that incident with the burning barge just made it worse.

He owns a small flat in the Schlafstadt district, from which he undertakes many a nightly foray into the Three Toll Bridge in search of wine, weirdroot and political opinion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Michaela von J&auml;nke is somewhat of an expert on legal liberties. She is also said to hold some of the most exquisite parties in Altdorf.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A few weeks back the watch took hold of Andreas Gesetz the Cartographer, saying his maps were so contradictory he must have been taking Notropian Blue. It turns out though he was using a licensed supplier, so the case got dismissed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The problem is this city just does not value the written word! You can burn the works of Leonardo and suffer no more than a penny fine for destroying the parchment!&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Joey Proudhun &ndash; Halfling Agitator</h3>\n<p>A little man with big ideas, Joey came to the capitol of the Empire demanding reform of the outdated political system in favour of a thinking man&rsquo;s representative council based on the shire system of the moot. As a Halfling, Joey has been refused membership of every radical group he has sought to join, which he puts down to just another example of the outmoded &lsquo;bigist&rsquo; ideas of the supposedly civilised humans. Each day Joey preaches from a barrel top about political reform, handing out leaflets and quoting passages from &lsquo;the Blood of Innocents&rsquo; when the watch are not looking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The Van Damneg Print-works does good rates per sheet, which is why they get so much custom. Everything from honest essays upon the plight of the working man to textbooks for surgeons and priests.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Michaela von J&auml;nke is just another example of the corrupt nature of the cities political elite &ndash; she is no friend of the common man regardless of his stature that is for sure!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The so-called rumours of Rat-men are no more than the Emperor&rsquo;s Lies to confuse the common man &ndash; The legions of Fishmen are the true hidden enemy of the Empire!&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>"}
{"_id":"ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs","name":"The Jade Sceptre","content":"<p>Cultists of Slaanesh are very different from the followers of Tzeentch. Where the Purple Hand concocts endlessly complex plans to place its agents in positions of power and the Red Crown recruits mutants and prepares for a future uprising, the followers of Slaanesh have little time for deep-laid plans. Instead, they seek the instant gratification of all desires and probe the limits of physical and psychological excess. Their appetites are endless and insatiable, and power takes a distant second place to pleasure.</p>\n<h2>SLAANESH, THE DARK PRINCE </h2>\n<p>The promise of Slaanesh is the promise of ultimate pleasures, and the cults of Slaanesh are most common in the great cities, where the bored and well-to-do seek new and interesting vices to excite their jaded palates. Their interests span every possible appetite and pleasure, from art and fine dining and physical pleasures. The Dark Prince is not interested in mundane satisfaction however, but in the pursuit of pleasure through pain and excess. While most Witch Hunters look to the bordellos when hunting Slaaneshi cultists, an equal number can be found in the homes of the noble and the wealthy, where private parties behind closed doors have been known to take any number of disturbing turns.</p>\n<p>While the worship of Slaanesh presents an unquestionable threat to public morals, the followers of the Dark Prince do not generally seek the overthrow of the Empire, and cults like the Jade Sceptre tend not to be pursued with such vigour as those that clearly endanger the state. Indeed the status quo provides endless opportunities to cultists of Slaanesh, and the dreary pace of typical life in the Empire has driven many into their dark embrace.</p>\n<p>The followers of Slaanesh are implacably opposed to those of Khorne. Followers of the Blood God kill for the sake of killing, never glorying in the excess of death or taking pleasure in the pain they inflict. For their part, followers of Khorne despise the soft and hedonistic devotees of Slaanesh. Relations with the cults of Tzeentch vary: the ambitious Tzeentchians have been known to use Slaaneshi cultists as distractions or patsies, although from time to time they will solicit their help in corrupting a powerful individual who can then be controlled by means of blackmail or addiction. Cultists of Slaanesh and Nurgle tend to ignore each other unless the operations of one cult constitute a clear threat to the interests of the other.</p>\n<h2>Organisation</h2>\n<p>According to some Witch Hunters, the Jade Sceptre is barely an organisation at all. The cult seems to consist of a large number of local cells, some of which maintain a loose and intermittent contact with each other, but no hint of an overall leadership or power structure has been uncovered.</p>\n<p>Worse, the name ‘Jade Sceptre’ has sometimes been adopted by a variety of pleasure-seeking organisations that are unconnected with the worship of Slaanesh and do not seem to understand the import of the name: it has become an umbrella term under which all manner of gourmands, dilettantes, and hedonists gather. The name has become a sign of devotion to unbridled pleasure and contempt for morality by those who do not know its place in the lore of Chaos.</p>\n<p>A true Jade Sceptre cell can consist of up to forty individuals, and like the cult itself, most cells have no particular structure. Some are led by cult wizards, others by the wealthiest and most powerful members, or those whose homes are most commonly used for meetings, and others still by those who have the greatest interest in managing the calendar of events.</p>\n<h3>Symbol</h3>\n<p>Most Jade Sceptre cells use the common symbol of Slaanesh in rituals and as a recognition symbol when dealing with members of other cells. Some cultists wear it as a tattoo while others paint it on to their skin for rituals.</p>\n<p>There is a ceremonial Jade Sceptre from which the cult purports to take its name and which is often used in their most sacred rites and initiations. It is carved from jade, encircled in writhing figures, and inflicts a terrible yet irrestible pain when grasped. Though almost certainly a source of great Chaotic corruption, it is greatly sought after by those who know of it. For a terrible price paid directly to Slaanesh themself, the Sceptre is said to be able to cure mutation. There are mutants among the Jade Sceptre however, so if there is any truth to the rumour then the price demanded by the Dark Prince must be high indeed.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>The cult of the Jade Sceptre actively recruits those of all Species who show a predilection for self-indulgence, especially those who are rich or noble. Cultists, in particular those with no visible mutations, are usually very active in the society of their home town or city, frequenting all the best parties, balls, and other entertainments.</p>\n<p>They go out of their way to befriend a likely recruit, assess their predilections, and promise even greater pleasures of the same type. This period of initial contact is sometimes referred to as the ‘courtship’, and it lasts until the potential recruit is so addicted to their vices, and so hungry for more, that they will do anything to gratify their desires. At this point, under the promise of levels of hedonistic abandon beyond anything the recruit has known, the new member is formally inducted into the cult.</p>\n<p>Forms of initiation vary: a few cells use set rituals accompanied by readings from forbidden tomes; some substitute a painful hazing followed by an indulgent feast; and still others eschew all semblance of ritual and welcome the new member with the wildest and most decadent party they can devise.</p>\n<p>Once established in a city, a cell of the Jade Sceptre devotes itself to corrupting public morals, especially at the upper levels of society. Nobles and governing burghers become more and more openly dissolute and spend less and less time on the necessary tasks of government, trade, and the law. The end goal seems to be to turn the whole town into a morass of self-indulgence, utterly lawless and without ready defences. The process has only been completed in a few cases, though, since a point is usually reached where suspicions are raised. Witch Hunters descend on the town, trying and burning a great many innocent people and the handful of cultists who did not flee at the first sign of danger.</p>\n<h2>The Enemy of My Enemy</h2>\n<p>The role of the Jade Sceptre may seem obvious — they are a Chaos cult dedicated to a Ruinous Power, and the natural enemy of the Characters and most citizens of the Empire. However, their role in Power Behind the Throne is more nuanced. While they may act as antagonists, especially if the Characters find themselves chasing @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} or pursuing @JournalEntry[eZNUTrVGtnRXtKUx]{The Wine of Madness}, the Characters may just as easily find common cause with the cult.</p>\n<p>Though not as naturally opposed to Tzeentchian cults as followers of Nurgle, the Jade Scepter and The Purple Hand are often at odds. They compete for much the same resources — both recruiting impressionable nobility, albeit for different reasons. Additionally, the Purple Hand's plans for Middenheim  would see it ultimately fall to Chaos. While technically this is a favourable outcome for the Jade Scepter, in practice many of its members are far too enamored by the lifestyle they currently enjoy in the city to wish to see it fall too suddenly.</p>\n<p>If the Characters capture Gotthard alive, he will offer almost anything for his freedom, including the services of the Jade Scepter. He has influence over the cult, which has members throughout Middenheim. They could be useful spies, and provide some magical muscle if the players find themselves outmatched by a Purple Hand Magus or other agents of Wasmiere. </p>\n<p>Of course, any such alliance would be incredibly uneasy, morally fraught, and the Jade Sceptre are almost certain to betray the Characters in as excessive and painful a manner as possible just as soon as the opportunity presents itself.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>NEW TALENTS</em></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">The following Talents are sometimes granted to followers of Slaanesh.

{"_id":"OonygGgl5dY8QeHA","name":"Hausmeister Breugal - The Chamberlain","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/hausmeister-breugal.webp\" width=\"254\" height=\"288\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>The chamberlain is the Graf ’s head of household, and oversees all the staff in the palace. His is the final word on all domestic affairs and matters of protocol, and no event takes place in the palace without his direct involvement. He schedules all audiences, organises all dinners and receptions (including the annual @JournalEntry[vJmImfkNn1DONyrZ]{garden party}), and is in charge of hiring and firing servants and staff.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Breugal has a small but very neat suite of rooms in the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{Outer Palace}, and during Carnival week he never leaves the palace complex, overseeing every detail of the Graf ’s movements during that time as well as anything else that takes place there. If anything needs to be handled outside the palace — dealing with merchants and suppliers, for example — he either sends a member of his staff or summons the parties concerned to his office off the Graf ’s audience chamber. Even in his very rare free time (of which he has none in Carnival week), he does not frequent informal or lowbrow events, markets, or other ‘common’ locations.</p>\n<p>Reactions</p>\n<p>A Character of at least Gold 1 Status, or a lesser Character who can convincingly imitate these qualities, may be able to gain Breugal’s approval so long as they adhere to every scintilla of protocol. Anyone without @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (Noble)} is dismissed out of hand, and all others must make any necessary Fellowship Tests with a –20 penalty, such is the depth of his snobbery and devotion to ‘correct behaviour’.</p>\n<p>Knowledge</p>\n<p>Breugal knows much and suspects more, but says nothing. While he has the Graf ’s ear on domestic matters, he underestimates his influence, especially given the Graf ’s weakened condition. He refuses to listen to anything he considers ‘idle gossip’, anything vulgar, and anything that reflects poorly upon the Todbringer family or any of its members.</p>\n<p>While it is not impossible to get past Breugal and speak to the Graf directly, the chamberlain does everything in his not-inconsiderable power to prevent his master from being bothered, especially now. However, if the Characters can convince the chamberlain that the fate of the city or the life of the Graf are in danger — which is not easy — then he sends them to the major NPC whom he believes best placed to deal with the matter, writing a letter of introduction that urges the recipient to take them seriously.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Breugal has a very accurate idea of who influences Graf Boris, and how much. He underestimates his own influence, and overestimates that of the @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{Law Lords} and the @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Midden Marshals}, but only by a little. Otherwise, he is very rarely wrong.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Breugal’s only goal is to ensure the smooth running of the palace and its household so that all who see it are left in no doubt about the power and prestige of the Todbringer family. He ventures no opinions on politics, taxation, or anything else, regarding these matters as irrelevant to the true business of the palace, which is to be grand.</p>\n<h3>Breugal’s Role</h3>\n<p>Adding Breugal to <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> makes the adventure more challenging in a number of ways, and the GM should use him with care. If the Players enjoy roleplaying and NPC interaction — which are, after all, a major part of this adventure — he can add a great deal to the fun. On the other hand, if the party’s skills are more suited to combat than intrigue, the addition of another powerful NPC who requires careful handling may be too much.</p>\n<h4>Obstacle</h4>\n<p>As chamberlain to the Graf, Breugal oversees the running of the palace, and he can also control access to the Graf. Although he is only a slight physical threat in himself, he can call an almost unlimited number of Knights Panther and palace servants to deal with any riff-raff who threaten him or cause other kinds of trouble.</p>\n<p>Breugal’s default position toward anyone not of the court is one of disdain. Even high-ranking nobles from other cities, while accorded all the respect demanded by protocol and good manners, find that Breugal can be surprisingly effective in keeping unwanted visitors at bay. Those of lower social status find it even harder.</p>\n<p>Approaching Breugal is best through another NPC, whom he already knows and respects. If the Characters can make a good impression on him during an initial conversation (which is best done by expressing a devotion to the interests of the Graf and his city, while at the same time maintaining all the rules of etiquette and politeness), he might come around to their side and become a source of support rather than an obstacle. However, he helps in his own way, according to what he thinks is best (and most respectable, and in keeping with his idea of his office and its powers), which may not always be the kind of help that the Characters want or expect.</p>\n<h4>Influence</h4>\n<p>According to the system on @JournalEntry[BGdbAf7b92xpZpfg]{The Powers That Be}, Breugal has moderate influence (2 ‘votes’) over Graf Boris.</p>\n<p>Adding Breughal to the mix of NPCs raises the total number of ‘influence votes’ from 17 to 19, requiring the Characters to amass 10 ‘votes’ rather than 8 to ensure that the tax measures are rescinded.</p>\n<h3>Pressure Points</h3>\n<p>In concocting his plan (see @JournalEntry[efYPFvLrN0nHN2tq]{The Evil Plot}), the evil Law Lord and Purple Hand cultist @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier} has completely overlooked the influence of the chamberlain, and this gives the Characters a small advantage: an NPC who has not yet been compromised.</p>\n<p>Breugal has no obvious pressure points: indeed, he has been careful to avoid any circumstance that could compromise him and lead him to endanger the honour or the safety of the Todbringer family or their court. The Characters have to gain his support honestly and honourably, unless the GM decides otherwise and gives him a secret vice or some other weakness. <em>Hammers of Ulric</em> hints at a sadistic streak in his nature, which may reflect a greater interest in whipping underlings than discipline warrants, and it also suggests that he is a worshipper of Sigmar rather than Ulric, which could make his position increasingly uncomfortable in the growing religious tensions.</p>\n<h2>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</h2>\n<p>Like the NPC sheets in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, the sheet for Breugal gives his impressions of the other major NPCs, but to add him to the adventure, the GM must also know what they think of him.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: A polite but distant relationship. Breugal regards Sparsam’s role as necessary but rather sordid.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: Unfortunate that he is lowborn, for he has several admirable qualities: not least, in Breugal’s eyes, his loyalty to the Graf and his dignified presence when serving as his champion.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: Pretty, in both form and sound, but frivolous. Still, a court must have a minstrel. To Breugal, Rallane falls somewhere between an ornate tapestry and a vase of flowers.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: Though he would never admit it, and would be mortified at the suggestion, Breugal views Katarina with an almost fatherly affection. He expects to shed a discreet tear whenever she is married.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: A warm, if stiff and formal, relationship, based almost entirely on their shared prejudices and snobbery. Even so, they sometimes compete with each other over who can adhere more strictly to the most rigid and ancient codes of protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Breugal respects them and views them as a necessary projection of the Graf ’s power, but secretly he regrets that Baron Heinrich is not among them.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Magic, by its very nature, is based on breaking the rules that normally govern the behaviour of people and objects — Breugal instinctively distrusts it. He also fears that magical power will make wizards arrogant, and less respectful toward their aristocratic betters.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Breugal respects all the gods, deeming this correct behaviour, but is not especially devout. In fact, he rather distrusts those he considers ‘enthusiasts’ in the matter of religion. Still, the forms and rituals of worship appeal to him. He knows Ar-Ulric as a role, not as a person: to him, the robes matter more than the man wearing them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Breugal is courteously distant toward all of them, and so long as they bring no breath of scandal to the palace, he does not involve himself in their business. He knows that there is, or was, a relationship between Emmanuelle and the Graf, and suspects that her head has been turned by another: this leads him to be somewhat chilly toward her.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: Like a minstrel, a master of the hunt is a necessary member of an Electoral court, but Breugal sees Allavandrel in an abstract way, as more of a palace appurtenance than a person.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Breugal instinctively dislikes him, both for his personality and his money-grubbing way of life. This dislike is made all the stronger by Breugal’s belief that Gotthard is of noble blood but is hiding his true lineage, and by the looks Breugal has caught him casting in the direction of the ‘Princess’ and the other ladies.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: The Tilean appals Breugal in every fibre of his being, though he does reluctantly admit that he has been of some help to Baron Steffan.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Another necessary evil for the governance of the city, Breugal exchanged civilities with them when required but has never sought their acquaintance.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Breugal will not leave the palace grounds during the Carnival.

While easy, the process  is not very pleasant, as Wallenstein is clearly only interested in what he can get out of any relationship with the party — especially money, power, or pleasure.

If they find him somewhere secluded, they might rescue him from a small group of Skaven, in a kidnapping attempt that foreshadows a successful attempt at the conclusion of the adventure, prior to the events of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, the next part of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>.</p>\n<p>Wallenstein has nothing to offer the Characters in advancing the plot of this adventure, but if the players have realised that he is really the last of the Wittgensteins, they may use their inquiries as a cover to interrogate him subtly about his ancestor Dagmar von Wittgenstein, the missing warpstone, and the cult of @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{The Jade Sceptre}. You can decide how much free rein to allow the Players in these inquiries, as they constitute distraction from the main plot of the adventure, and may delay the Characters’ progress fatally. Ideally, the Players should become convinced that their first priority is to save the Graf and the city, and that Wallenstein/Wittgenstein can wait until later: they cannot know at this point that ‘later’ never comes.</p>\n<p>However, it may be possibly for the Characters to convince, blackmail, or otherwise cajole Wallenstein into helping them in other ways. The Komission Convener enjoys his positions in the city, and the Jade Sceptre immensely. The idea of the Purple Hand bringing a terrible wave of change to this pleasant state of affairs would distress him. Though good Sigmar-fearing Characters would undoubtedly have to hold their noses, Wallenstein/Wittgenstein and the cult of the Jade Sceptre more broadly may provide an ally of convenience during the Carnival. Of course, Wallenstein would undoubtedly plan to have the Characters disposed of just as soon as the more immediate threat had been dealt with.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Once he becomes convinced that the Characters have something to trade, Wallenstein makes extravagant claims about his position and influence in the city, promising to arrange personal interviews with everyone from the Graf to the chief rat catcher. In fact, he cannot deliver on any of these promises, since most of the major NPCs either dislike him, or are unaware of his existence. He always makes sure that he gets what he wants before attempting to keep his side of any bargain, and then starts actively avoiding the Characters. If he finds himself with no other choice, he pens a hasty letter of introduction which is either be rejected outright or imposes a –20 penalty to any <strong>Fellowship </strong>Tests that the Characters make in a first encounter with the letter’s addressee.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/gotthard-wallenstein.webp","folder":"9nJ4brecw2MRO3vH","sort":1400000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":1400000}}}
{"_id":"P9tstqsGDGkwai3B","name":"Injury","content":"<p>2Almost all characters will suffer injuries during the course of play. The injury rules show you how to deal with them and how to heal them, when possible.</p>\n<h3><strong>Wounds, Critical Wounds, and Death</strong></h3>\n<p>Wound loss represents minor cuts and abrasions, bruises and bashes, and even the depletion of spiritual and mental energy reserves. By comparison, Critical Wounds are much more severe, expressing serious injuries, broken bones, torn muscles, and ripped flesh. Gain too many Critical Wounds, and you risk death.</p>\n<h4><strong>Wounds</strong></h4>\n<p>Wounds are lost by sustaining Damage. Each time you suffer a point of Damage, you lose 1 Wound. So, if you suffer 8 points of Damage, you lose 8 Wounds. Often, especially in combat, your Toughness Bonus or Armour Points may reduce suffered Damage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, if you were hit in the arm for 10 Damage and your Toughness Bonus was 3, and you had leather armour on that arm for 1 Armour Point, you would suffer 6 Wounds (10–3–1=6). The rules will tell you when you can or cannot reduce Damage with Toughness and Armour Points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you lose all of your Wounds, your collected injuries overwhelm you, and you gain the Prone Condition. Until you heal at least 1 Wound, you cannot lose the Prone Condition; worse, if you’re not healed within a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus, you will pass out, gaining the Unconscious Condition. You will not regain consciousness until you heal back at least 1 Wound (see @JournalEntry[Healing]).</p>\n<p>If you take enough Damage that you would be taken to negative Wounds — say you suffered 5 Damage when you only had 2 Wounds left — you suffer a Critical Wound. If you suffer fewer negative Wounds than your Toughness Bonus (so, fewer than –4 Wounds if your Toughness Bonus is 4), you subtract –20 from your Critical Table result, with a minimum result of 01 (see page 174). Note: You never actually go into negative Wounds. The lowest number of Wounds you can ever have is 0.</p>\n<h4><strong>Critical Wounds</strong></h4>\n<p>Critical Wounds are most commonly suffered in combat when something really wants to hurt you. The two most frequent sources of Critical Wounds are when a Critical Hit is scored, or when you lose more Wounds than you have (see @JournalEntry[Combat] for more on how Critical Hits happens).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each Critical Wound you receive will impact your ability to function in a different way. To determine what effects a Critical Wound has, refer to the Critical Tables (see page 174).</p>\n<h4><strong>Death</strong></h4>\n<p>If you take the @Condition[Unconscious] Condition and have 0 Wounds, compare the total number of Critical Wounds you currently suffer with your Toughness Bonus. If you have more Critical Wounds than your Toughness Bonus, you succumb to your horrific wounds and will die at the end of the round unless, by some miracle, someone heals one of your Critical Wounds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, if you have the Unconscious Condition, anyone attacking you with suitable weapons can kill you, should they wish.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Though, in the thick of combat, those lying apparently dead on the floor are almost always ignored in favour of combatants still standing.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a few results sourced from the Critical Tables can result in death. Should any of these occur, it is time to permanently spend a @JournalEntry[Fate and Resilience]{Fate point} if you have one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Pulling Your Blows</h3>\n<p>The rules assume you wish to inflict every possible Critical Wound you can. However, it’s also possible you may just want to subdue, not kill, your opponents. Or you may be sparring. With that in mind, you may ignore any Critical Hit you should inflict upon your opponents if you declare you are ‘pulling your blow’ before you roll to hit. If you do this, make sure you describe the situation appropriately, making it clear you’re using the flat of your blade or otherwise doing what you can to avoid properly hurting your opponent.</p>\n<h3>Options: Sudden Death</h3>\n<p>Rather than worrying about Critical Wounds and protracted deaths, you may simply wish to know if someone is dead or not. The GM can do this by using the Sudden Death rules, which significantly accelerates play. When your targets suffer more damage than they have Wounds, they simply die in a suitably dramatic fashion or immediately gain the Unconscious Condition. Your choice.</p>\n<p>Sudden Death is especially useful for quickly dealing with minor foes such as Brigands, Cultists, or Wild Animals, although it should not be used for PCs or important NPCs.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","folder":"KBFMpqeeMFWhdpSI","sort":600001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"}}}

The Bridge</h3>\n<p>This is a basic wooden bridge, supported on two stone pillars. It is about 8 yards long and 2 yards wide.</p>\n<h3>2. The Mill</h3>\n<p>This is occupied by Hector Brioche, a garrulous and friendly man, with his wife Simone and their daughters Nana(15) and Lola (14). This is a two-storey building larger than other houses in Frugelhofen. Brioche deals with grain from both outlying farms, and has some fields of his own just outside the village which yield a small amount. East of the mill is also a hedged-off orchard, and Brioche makes strong cider and an apple brandy. Being a jack-of-all-trades, Hector is the village baker to boot.</p>\n<p>Hector is the nearest thing to a leader in Frugelhofen; the villagers will look to him in times of trouble or adversity. While he is not a major NPC, a profile is given for him in the reference section.</p>\n<p>The Brioches have a paying guest staying in a spare room. This is Shalyir Moonhand, an Elf warrior of no mean ability. She is dealt with in the Major NPCs section below.</p>\n<h3>3. Heymann Home</h3>\n<p>A standard house, occupied by Kastor and Gilda Heymann, a middle-aged couple. These are dull, staid folk.</p>\n<h3>4. Lutter Home</h3>\n<p>This is occupied only by Reinwald Lutter, a 71 year old recluse suffering from the early stages of dementia.</p>\n<p>Reinwald mutters a lot, and has occasional abusive outbursts which tend to be stimulated by the sight of 'furriners'.</p>\n<h3>5. Lauterbach Home</h3>\n<p>Andreas and Gottlieb Lauterbach, a pair of rowdy brothers aged 22 and 23, live here. The ground directly behind their home is fenced off with a high fence they have erected to protect their trained (and vicious) ferrets. These two are often drunk, often bored, and spoiling for a fist fight.</p>\n<h3>6. Krautheim Home</h3>\n<p>The Krautheims are often referred to by the villagers of Bretonnian blood as &lsquo;les lapins&rsquo;- the rabbits, a fact explained by their brood of children, Hedwig (16) and Tilda (15) their daughters, and their sons Leopold (11), Wolf (8), Diehl (5) and Werner (3). Their home is crowded to say the least. Anton, the father, is a strong, fit man of 34, while his wife Gretchen is a greasy-haired plain-faced woman with a bad complexion usually seen holding a rolling pin. She is currently six months pregnant</p>\n<h3>7. Villa Giscard</h3>\n<p>The Bretonnian couple here are middle-class provincial folk (from Poussenc) fallen on hard times, but they still have pathetic (although amusing) pretensions - climbing roses framing a name-board over the front door, varnished wooden window boxes of alpine flowers, and suchlike. They are settling into middle age (Alphonse is 36, Mimi is 34) in different ways.<br />Alphonse's main noteworthy feature is his extreme rotundity, while his wife Mimi is secretly having an affair with Knud Bergman (see below). Their daughter Fleur (9) is a nasty child with rat-tail hair and mishapen teeth who likes biting people, and is generally a horrid spoiled brat.</p>\n<h3>8. The Trappers</h3>\n<p>Knud Bergman and his cousin Waldemar live here when they are in Frugelhofen, but at present they are off on a trapping expedition. Mimi Giscard cleans their home while they are away. The PCs don&rsquo;t get to meet the Bergmans, since they are being eaten by hungry bears at the exact moment the PCs first enter town.</p>\n<h3>9. Chateau Papin</h3>\n<p>Here, Gilles and Etelka Papin (he is of Bretonnian stock, she is a Reiklander from Helmgart) compete with the Giscards for tastelessness in peers their house (which is slightly larger than most). Their. home also doubles as the village store, and Gilles make regular trips to Grun&eacute;re to buy stock (blankets, pots and pans, tools, fabrics etc) which he resells here at a healthy profit (double WFRP rulebook prices). The Papins also have a guest, an eccentric inhabitant of Albion whom Gilles met on his most recent trip to Grune&eacute;re. This is Cecil de Vere Cholmondeley (pronounced &lsquo;Chumley&rsquo;), who currently occupies their spare room. He is detailed in the Major NPCs section.</p>\n<h3>10. The Stables and Dairy</h3>\n<p>These are owned by Widow Le Roux (see 11). A floorplan is provided, for this is where the PCs will stay &mdash; mainly because there isn&rsquo;t anywhere else. The section headed Enquiries and Encounters in Frugelhofen deals with how the PCs can get accommodation in the village.</p>\n<p>This large building has a slightly leaky roof, and is home to four horses and half a dozen cattle - occupants get woken an hour before dawn by loud mooing!.</p>\n<h3>11. The Widow Le Roux</h3>\n<p>Katrina Le Roux lives here, her husband Pierre having died two years ago. Katrina is a striking woman, looking younger than her 54 years, and has no intention of becoming a dried-out spinster. She may be quite predatory towards a suitable male PC. She owns the stables and dairy (see 10), and the other villagers pay her (in money, food, or help) for the use of the place.</p>\n<p>Katrina is a generous, kindly woman who is much liked by the community at large. Madame Le Roux has one son, Armand ~&mdash; a goatherd and shepherd of 26 years who spends most of his time away from the village tending his flock.</p>\n<h3>12. The Barn</h3>\n<p>The villagers built this together, and it is communally owned. Grain and other foodstuffs are stored here, although the barn is rather bigger than needed - when it was built, the villagers expected Frugelhofen to grow larger than it has. At present, &lsquo;Albi&rsquo; Schutz is bunking down here. He is detailed in the Profiles section.</p>\n<p>The barn is also home to the escargots of Frugelhofen. These are round, one-person boats, made of leather over a wicker frame which is reminiscent of a huge snail shell &mdash; hence their Bretonnian name. There are about 20 of these small boats: one for each villager plus a few spares, for seasonal fishing in the small lake below the Frugelhorn glacier is an important part of the village&rsquo;s food supply. The escargots will be very important later on, as you will see.</p>\n<h3>13. Gascoigne Home</h3>\n<p>Alain Gascoigne lives here with his tragic wife Veronique. Veronique contracted Black Plague from a rat bite in Gisoreux, where the couple once lived. The disease was cured after several unsuccessful attempts, but Veronique was left disfigured and disabled. Alain hoped the mountain air would help, and bought this house from a relative, but Veronique hides indoors and never allows herself to be seen. Alain is now plunged into gloom and despair.</p>\n<p>Alain is, however, a man with a military background, and no average villager &mdash; details will be found in the Mayor NPCs section.</p>\n<h3>14.&nbsp; Lagisquet Home</h3>\n<p>Guillaume Lagisquet and his wife Chantal live here with their insufferable daughter Monique (12) and their new baby Jean-Michel. The Lagisquets are distantly related to minor Moussillon nobility, and don&rsquo;t let anyone forget it. Most other villagers dislike them strongly. Lagisquet is 51, 17 years older than his wife.</p>\n<p>This elicits the occasional derisive discussion among the other villagers from time to time.</p>\n<h3>15. The Ford</h3>\n<p>Frugelhofen was originally built up around one of the rare fording-points of the Vaswaser, and the bridge was a later addition. At most times of the year, the ford is about a foot deep, with a bed of gravel and shingle.</p>\n<p>Beside it, in the fork made by stream and road, stands a cairn of rocks and pebbles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":""}

Could an arrow cut it?’, for example. When it’s your Turn, you’ll make your Move and take Action! </p>\n<p>On your Turn you have a Move and an Action, you can take these in any order — it’s presumed you are probably doing both at the same time, and you can freely describe them as one combined manoeuvre. You can also skip taking an Action or Move, though you won’t get another opportunity until the next Round!</p>\n<p>Vivid descriptions of what you do will bring the Combat to life. Rather than declare your action is, ‘hit the Goblin’, it’s much more fun to say, ‘I Kick the chair in front of me towards the Goblins and lunge with my sword at the closest one’s throat’. You never know, the GM might reward you with the odd bonus for great roleplaying. This goes for the resolution of your Action too — the GM will describe the outcome, but you can certainly embellish it! </p>\n<h4>Move</h4>\n<p>In most circumstances, exact distances don’t matter too much. Use your Movement Characteristic as a guide to the ground you can cover, and the GM will let you know if the move will take more than one Turn. Reaching difficult places, perhaps by climbing or jumping, will also use your Action if you need to Test a Skill to get there (perhaps with a Climb or Athletics Test).</p>\n<p>If you are not already fighting someone, you can also use your Move to Charge into close combat, gaining +1 Advantage. For more on this, and for a detailed breakdown of movement speeds, leaping distances, and more, see @JournalEntry[efIMLdnXk5Y7leLu]{Moving During Combat}.</p>\n<h4>Action</h4>\n<p>In combat, your Action is used to do something. Whether that’s swing a sword at a Mutant, jump from rooftop to rooftop, or take a moment to gauge the situation, that’s up to you. Your Action is only limited by your imagination, the physical constraints of the fight location and the capabilities of your Character.</p>\n<p>Describe what you want your Character to do. The GM will then tell you if you need to make a Test to succeed at your planned Action. The results will then be narrated by you and the GM, ending your Action.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><strong>Example</strong>: </span>Molli looks on nervously from behind a barrel as Salundra is beset by the flying fists of three pub brawlers keen to put the young captain in her place. On her Turn, Molli’s player asks if the pub has an upper floor. The GM confirms it does, and that it has a balcony overlooking the fight. Smiling, the player declares Molli will sprint upstairs and push a table down on the fight to help break it up using both her Move and Action. Given the upper floor isn’t far away, the GM decides Molli can get there in a single Round but pushing the small table there will take a little effort.</p>\n<p>The GM calls for an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test to heft the table over the balcony. Molli’s Athletics is 34, so she needs to roll 54 or under. She rolls 21, for +3 SL, and the table flies! Molli shouts out as the table tips: ‘Stop fighting!’ The GM states all combatants below must perform an <strong>Opposed Dodge</strong> Test against the +3 SL or be hit by the table. Unfortunately, only Salundra fails this, and the table lands squarely on her head…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Free Actions</h4>\n<p>Some things you’ll want your Character to do won’t count as your Action for the round — such as shouting a warning,  drawing your weapon, or drinking a potion. It’s the GM’s decision on what takes up your Action, and what you can do in a Round.

Many city organisations submit recommendations, and the Worshipful Guild of Legalists assists them in drafting new laws. The Law Lords remain carefully impartial. Very influential as a group (3 votes).</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>The Law Lords have rooms in the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{Inner Palace} and town houses. Audiences are only granted to representatives of key interests in Middenheim — certainly not to mere adventurers.</p>\n<p>Ehrlich is hiding in his house, receiving only the daily food deliveries for himself and his animals. Wasmeier is @Roll[1d100]{10%} likely to be home at any time. Otherwise he is in the palace, with his pawns, or attending some event. The same applies to Hoflich. </p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>The famously impartial Law Lords are rarely swayed by Fellowship Tests — grant the Law Lords +6 SL in any opposed Test they make to resist being Charmed, Intimidateed, etc.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Nearly two months ago, Ehrlich’s niece Reya was kidnapped; Hoflich told him to support the proposed taxes if he wanted to see her again. Ehrlich complied, and the taxes were passed. Ehrlich immediately fled to his house, following Hoflich’s instructions to see and speak to no one until after the Carnival — when, Hoflich promised, Reya will be returned unharmed.</p>\n<p>@Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{The Doppelgänger} knows which NPCs Wasmeier controls, and knows its own role in the plot.</p>\n<p>Wasmeier, of course, knows everything about the plot. He also knows the identities of the Purple Hand’s leaders in Middenheim.</p>\n<p>Questioning Hoflich or Wasmeier will arouse their suspicions. Hoflich will ask — a little too keenly — who else the Characters have met; Wasmeier, more cautious, will secretly hinder them until he can silence all of them at once.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>The Law Lords know who influences the Graf, but underestimate the influence the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’} could have if she chose to use it.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Ehrlich will not act until he knows his niece is safe. This is crucial to the pacing of the adventure, since Ehrlich’s knowledge makes further investigation unnecessary.</p>\n<p>@Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{The Doppelgänger} is looking forward to ‘becoming’ Graf Boris. If it believes Wasmeier has failed, it will adopt a deliberately nondescript Human form and flee the city.</p>\n<p>Wasmeier’s goals are detailed in ‘@JournalEntry[efYPFvLrN0nHN2tq]{Chapter Three: The Evil Plot}’. If all is lost, he will follow his prearranged escape plan (see ‘@JournalEntry[uRYJa7d36ckfIw6S]{Wasmeier at Bay}').</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs </h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Formal but mildly cordial relations. Wasmeier controls him through his addiction.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: No dealings. Wasmeier controls him through hypnotism.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: No dealings. Wasmeier and the Doppelgänger avoid him in case he senses something wrong about Hoflich.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — the ‘Princess’</strong>: Rare, formal encounters. Wasmeier knows she influences the Graf, but believes he does not need her.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: Rare, formal interactions.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Rare professional meetings. Wasmeier believes their avoidance of politics will keep them from becoming a problem.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: A member of the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Wizards’ Guild}, Wasmeier maintains good relations with them. Helseher believes Wasmeier’s denials about the Scroll Tax.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Occasional formal dealings. Wasmeier thinks Ar-Ulric and Ehrlich are closer than they really are, and worries that Ehrlich’s depression and Ar-Ulric’s obvious stress may push one or both into a dangerous breakdown.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — </strong>Paramour: To Ehrlich, she is just another Lady at Court. Wasmeier relies on her to keep @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} from crumbling until the plan is completed.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: No interactions.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Dismissed as irrelevant.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Few interactions. Wasmeier is mildly concerned about his friendship with the @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Minstrel} — two sharp Elven minds might be a threat — but believes they have little influence over the Graf.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Regular meetings. Ehrlich regards him as a crook. Wasmeier sees him as a possible scapegoat. Neither knows of his connection to @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{the Jade Sceptre}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Ehrlich has never met him. Wasmeier worries about his unpredictable nature and may decide to have @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} and her minions (see ‘@JournalEntry[jepWFu96Qh64OlHw]{Pawns of the Evil Wizard}’) kill him if he becomes a threat.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>All three see Breugal as just another palace servant — a senior one, to be sure, but a servant nonetheless — to whom one speaks in order to see the Graf.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[KZjUllCfHJl4kZ2F]{Thognar}- The Clerk</strong>: The three Law Lords are all familiar with Thognar, as he has occasionally accompanied Convenor Magradil to make reports on behalf of the Komission. If he is assured of the Characters’ discretion, Wasmeier may even recommend they add their names to Thognar’s petition.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess:</strong> They remain politely cordial with Edel and respect her intelligence in debates regarding city law. Wasmeier plans to blackmail her about the stolen books if she becomes a problem.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>Ehrlich speaks out for the Cult of Shallya from time to time and has a good relationship with the High Matriarch. Wasmeier and the doppelgänger have no interest in Isolde and do not consider her a threat to their plans.</p>\n<h3>Deadly Secret: The Purple Hand</h3>\n<p>Wasmeier is Magister Magistri of the Purple Hand, whose Inner Council consists of himself, respected Gottfried Jarmund, and Chancellor’s clerk Erich Kalzbad. Any of them can send cultists or hired thugs to harass or murder; specialists such as skilled assassins take longer to arrange, and are unavailable during this adventure.</p>\n<p>Jarmund and Kalzbad know only that all cult members must support the taxes enthusiastically.

Wasmeier, of course, is the Magister Magistri of the cult of the Purple Hand — and the prime mover behind the plot of this adventure.  He is so busy making sure that everything goes according to plan that he has no time for anything else, even if ‘Kastor Lieberung’ turns up in Middenheim demanding an audience.</p>\n<p>Hoflich has been replaced by a Doppelgänger, which is doing everything possible to keep a low profile without arousing suspicion. The creature will avoid everyone who seems interested in discussing the taxes or asking questions of any other kind.</p>\n<p>Ehrlich is felled by a mixture of fear for his kidnapped niece, and depression at the position this enforces upon him. He has shut himself up in his house and refuses to come out.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: The Law Lords do not provide introductions in this adventure; instead, the Characters may well be trying to persuade other NPCs to introduce them to the Law Lords.

Although the University of Nuln is technically an older building, a tradition of sharing knowledge and keeping records is said to have been practiced in Sigmar&rsquo;s Reikdorf. Today, the walled university complex is one of the Empire&rsquo;s famous wonders. Five gates provide access to a sprawling maze of lecture halls, dormitories, and office buildings. A confusing array of staircases connect the multi-tiered open quads where students hurry between classes. Visitors without guides are bound to become disoriented.</p>\n<p>The university&rsquo;s five most prestigious colleges are those of law, medicine, military history, alchemy, and bestiara. Nuln is generally considered to have superior faculties of mathematics, science, philosophy, theology, and literature; however, Altdorf is somewhat less exclusive, making it more accessible to middleclass students. The diversity of the student body encourages vibrant intellectual discourse, and the nearby Street of a Hundred Taverns is abuzz with academic debate. Minor gods and their esoteric cults also find favour with the students; agitators compete for attention at the adjunct temple of Borchbach and the columned hall of the University&rsquo;s sanctuary to the classical god Clio houses archaeological finds discovered in and around Altdorf.</p>\n<p>A meister represents the professors of each college, and reports to the chancellor and vice-chancellor. Meisters are concerned with securing as much financing for their faculty as possible from the chancellor&rsquo;s office. The Komission of Procuration handles admission, funding, and discipline. The university employs its own watchmen (called &lsquo;porters&rsquo;) and enforces night curfews with a variable degree of success. The gates are closed during curfew hours, but adventurous students have found that sections of the wall are easy to climb down from within (although getting back inside can be difficult).</p>\n<h3>The Lodge of the League of Karl-Franz</h3>\n<p>The university&rsquo;s oldest lodge receives funding from aristocratic alumni. Its lodge is a turreted, stone building ornamented with wolf and griffon statuary. The League of Karl-Franz is infamous for the debauched behaviour of its membership,</p>\n<p>who revel in both this reputation and their apparent immunity to consequences for it. By long tradition, the revered bust of Ulric in the front hall is turned towards the wall between dusk and dawn so that he doesn&rsquo;t have to witness League members disgrace themselves. Membership is restricted to noble students, few of whom would be tolerated if not for their family titles.</p>\n<h3>Ulli von Tasseninck School of Religious Studies</h3>\n<p>The university&rsquo;s theological college operates with funding from the Knights of Everlasting Light and the noble von Tasseninck family. In front of the modern, brick building is a statue of Ulli von Tasseninck, an Ostland nobleman who was executed without trial during the 2506 Waterfront War. A vandal removed the statue&rsquo;s head some time ago, and pranksters often substitute it with a pumpkin. The student body includes initiates and lay scholars of both noble and common parentage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Map</h3>\n<p>@Scene[4hXNIoTga5SlXpER]{Altdorf University}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>NPCs</h3>\n<p>@Actor[GxtHDkmCefBgxN74]{Chancellor Eberhardt von Festschrift}</p>\n<p>@Actor[tc4WITZkNwFsHUYG]{Professor Quintus Fassbinder}</p>\n<p>@Actor[X63X3ysiHiqyYkuq]{Professor Frederich &lsquo;Old&rsquo; Weirde}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@Actor[GjSHESknElpcsOlJ]{Gerhardt von Jungfreud}</p>\n<p>@Actor[HocaZJvFpAgLwcUR]{Michaela von Janke}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Tables</h3>\n<p>@RollTable[9oygZV4n0WQuuX13]{University Watchmen}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Finding Fassbinder</h3>\n<p>Once the PCs arrive at the University, they can follow the signs to the administrative offices. As with most bureaucracies, there are more people seeking assistance than there are clerks on duty helping them. After waiting for quite a while, the PCs are able to obtain directions to Fassbinder&rsquo;s office. Likewise, general inquiries at the University will also lead them to Fassbinder, although they are likely to be directed to a handful of other Professors first, spending probably half a day identifying the right man to ask. If they ask about the Doktor&rsquo;s hours, the clerk lets out a snort and replies that Doktor Fassbinder tends to keep rather unusual hours, so it&rsquo;s hard to tell if he is in or not.</p>\n<p>Following the directions, the PCs come to a closed door at the end of a dimly lit hall in the basement of the College of Imperial History.</p>"}

Any PC who passes three tests in a row catches up with Kurt and can apprehend him though if you want to interject a little drama into the proceedings Kurt may attempt a round or two of combat in order to resist arrest but will give up as soon as he is outnumbered (so typically he will just attempt to hit the Watchman who captures him and then run off again).</p>\n<p>Should no Watchmen pass three Agility Tests in a row they can pick up Kurt&rsquo;s trail again on a successful Follow Trail Skill Test.</p>\n<p><strong>4e:&nbsp;</strong>Kurt has a 4SL lead, use the standard prusuit rules</p>\n<h2>Back at the Station</h2>\n<p>Should they take the Kurt back to the station he will engage the Tileans in their own tongue.</p>\n<p>Whilst the Agitator is not keen to help the Watchmen, he is sympathetic with the Tileans, having been a student of Bestiaria himself.

They might even be the same cultists the party encountered on an earlier visit to Altdorf, if they are still alive. One has a purple feather in his hat, the other a leather belt pouch dyed mauve. Most Players realise that the two are agents of the Purple Hand, but if these clues go unnoticed, no matter: it makes this event all the more bewildering.</p>\n<p>As the Characters continue with their preparations, the two men look at each other, nod, and take a few purposeful strides toward the party. Then one puts a restraining hand on the other’s arm and gestures briefly toward the crate. They look at each other again, shrug, and turn around, melting into the crowd before the Characters can catch up to them.</p>\n<p>It is obvious that something about the crate led the two cultists to change their minds about confronting the Characters. A successful <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test reveals that the side facing the cultists is marked with the delivery address: Captain Scharlach, the Crossed Keys, Hoffen Strasse, Middenheim.</p>\n<p>If the Characters wish to talk to the cultists they have to pursue and apprehend them. The cultists attempt to escape, they have a head start of 3 and the same profiles as the @Actor[G3DW990j07OftQut]{cultists} in Middenheim. If the cultists are killed they are found to have a small tattoo of a purple hand on their left breast.</p>\n<p>If the cultists are subdued and questioned they seem rather bewildered as to the attitude of the person they believe to be Kastor Lieberung. One of them even goes so far as to say, “<em>Look, I don’t know what’s got into you recently Kastor, it’s been a concern to us, but if you’re on your way we’re willing to stay out of it.”</em> If Characters make appropriate noises about travelling to Middenheim, this draw an additional remark of ‘<em>seems like a bit of a waste, but so be it’</em>. If they are questioned beyond this they clam up and try to fight their way out of the situation. No further actions from the party persuade them to elaborate.</p>\n<p>The name and address on the crate are a Purple Hand code: as the Characters find out later, there is no Captain Scharlach. To cultists in Middenheim, the code means ‘These people have been sent to you, and they know nothing.’ To those along the way, it means ‘Let these people pass; they are being sent to others in the Order.’ The players have no way of knowing this, but they may already suspect that the party is being sent into a trap, and this strange event only serves to make them more uncomfortable. It should also serve as a hint that some answers to the puzzle that is The Purple Hand may lie in Middenheim.</p>\n<h3>Not Wanted</h3>\n<p>Also on a previous visit to Altdorf, the Characters @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.marbCRAizx1tjBQ3]{became persons of interest} in the deaths of two young nobles. However, this time they  see no wanted posters anywhere in the city, and if they ask about the case they may learn that the murderers — stevedores from a dockside tavern where the nobles and their bodyguards had made themselves unpopular — were caught and hanged some weeks ago.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/purple-hand.webp\" width=\"141\" height=\"206\" /></div>","folder":"9l20ogJKAnhkPnIw","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":200000}}}

{"_id":"QwqyxweJ4DXB5aIh","name":"Porcolina Synopsis","content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Dulcina and Dulcetta are two sisters who live in the small hamlet of Schweinberg under the yoke of their domineering and evil father, Bastando. Bastando forbids his daughters to marry so they may continue to look after him in his old age. Dulcina is the fairer of the two and is pursued by two local youths, Lysenter and Salacio.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dulcetta, her plain and plumper sister is in love with Salacio, and curses her sister for preventing her affections from being realised.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Taking pity on the girl, the Goddess Rhya offers the girl a single wish, and Dulcetta asks for her sister to be turned into a pig. However, when granting the wish, Rhya is distracted by her lover Taal, and the spell goes awry: Dulcina does indeed become a pig, but this does nothing to deter Lysenter and Salacio’s amour. They are enraged to find her in the hands of the Butcher, and rescue her. In the climax of Act One, Lysenter and Salacio fight a duel over ‘Dulcina’, allowing Bastando to appear and try to kill the pig he does not know is his daughter. At the last moment, Dulcetta stops the blow, but her explanations do not stop the two men loving the same pig.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the Old Priest of Sigmar arrives and announces that while a woman may have only one man as his wife, there is no such rule for pigs. Overjoyed, Lysenter and Salacio plan for a double wedding, despite Bastando’s rage at such events.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Act Two begins with the wedding preparations. Dulcetta, distraught, prays to Rhya to end the situation. Rhya agrees but once again is distracted by Taal and disenchants the men but forgets to turn Dulcina back into a girl. Moments later, the pig herd is gathered by the Butcher once again. Dulcetta begs Lysenter and Salacio to go after Dulcina but they do not believe a pig could be their beautiful love. Dulcetta goes after Dulcina alone, and seeing her sister alone and afraid, softens her heart. The two escape only to run into Bastando, who has come to kill Dulcina for abandoning him, knowing that killing a pig is no crime at all. Dulcetta protects her sister, and just as the blow is falling, the men arrive and Salacio leaps to save her.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bastando is defeated, and Salacio realises he loved Dulcetta all along. Lysenter however, is still stuck marrying a pig, and now also wishes to wed Dulcetta.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Salacio and the cast remind Lysenter that a pig can still make a good wife.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bastando too sings of the virtue of a good wife, saying that the lack of one is why he sought to keep his daughters to himself, since his wife died so young. Seeing such humility, Rhya relents and turns all of the pig herd into women. Lysenter marries Dulcina, Salacio marries Dulcetta and Bastando marries the very alluring Porcalina.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-23c19673-7fff-a6d4-c406-53bf6dd41f8d\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the rest of the male cast also find brides, they sing of the joy of their wedding day.</p>","folder":"qDIqsI1uxMugq0yt","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

Preparations for the Carnival are well under way as workers, swinging precariously from long ropes, attach bright banners to the dark-grey stone.</p>\n<p>Four stone viaducts wrap around the base of the rock, sloping gently up from the surrounding land. These viaducts, the Characters may learn, are each a mile long and 60 ft wide, with plenty of room to let carts pass in both directions. There is only a 3 ft stone wall to mark the outside edge, and especially on windy days, many cart drivers feel safer travelling in the middle of the road — which can lead to arguments. Pedestrians have the option of using one of two chair-lifts; the ride is spectacular and comparatively quick — but not for the faint of heart.</p>\n<h3>Welcome To Middenheim</h3>\n<p>If the party is arriving by coach or on horseback, a uniformed militiaman directs them to continue towards the viaduct. If the party is on foot the militiaman approaches, and says abruptly, ‘Viaduct or chair-lift?’</p>\n<p>The slightest delay in replying produces the retort, ‘Come on, come on. Never seen a city before? Do you want to enter by road or by chair-lift?’ This last sentence — especially the words in not in italic — is spoken slowly, in a very patronising manner. Once the party has replied it is directed towards the nearest chair-lift or viaduct as appropriate.</p>\n<p>At the start of each viaduct is a toll-gate. Local (recognised) farmers and those bearing the city’s coat of arms get in free; everyone else pays ‘a Crown a leg’. The chair-lift costs 1/– per passenger, plus 1/– to 20/– per item of luggage, depending on size. There are long queues before each main gate and at the chair-lift termini.</p>\n<p>Before the start of the Carnival, the party takes about an hour to reach the head of the queue, giving the opportunity for a couple of minor encounters to break the tedium and give the Characters a few snippets of information.</p>\n<h3>Rolfus Haffenvest</h3>\n<p>A wizard stalks away from the city, accompanied by a cart piled high with furniture and boxes. Clearly he is moving out of the city. If he spies any wizard type in the party, he approaches.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Middenheim!’ he spits. ‘Seat of learning, my thuribles! Take my advice and go elsewhere, unless you like paying good money for the privilege of existing!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rolfus is leaving the city after living there for ten years. If engaged in further conversation, he grumbles about the new Scroll Tax, blaming ‘<em>that miser Sparsam</em>’.</p>\n<h3>Hugnur Brimbeard</h3>\n<p>Any Dwarf in the party may be approached by Hugnur Brimbeard, who is accompanied by his wife and two young sons.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Take my advice and turn your back on this place,’ he says. ‘0 ’uns to the Carnival, and what happens? Soon as you get to the gate they charge you for the privilege of walking on their ground for the last 30 miles! Disgrace and insult, I call it. See that tower? My father built that tower! Well, we may have paid, but Brimbeards never stay where they’re abused and insulted.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hugnur is incensed at the Dwarf Tax and, although he has been forced to pay, he is leaving the city in protest.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>For Grognards: Tax Collection</em></h3>\n<p><em>Players who remember the first-edition version of Power Behind the Throne will expect to pay taxes on the way into the city. A cruel GM can use this knowledge against them. Some taxes are presented here, and others are covered in the box ‘Getting In’ bellow.</em></p>\n<p><em>Perhaps the taxes have not yet been fully implemented. The administration did not foresee, or plan for, the practical difficulties involved in stopping hundreds or thousands of visitors at the gates in the run-up to Carnival week, and at the insistence of Watch Commander Schutzmann — and much to the unspoken chagrin of Law Lord Wasmeier — all changes have been postponed until after the Carnival.</em></p>\n<p><em>Meanwhile, though, several enterprising locals are taking advantage of the flood of visitors — who have all heard of the new taxes and are expecting to have to pay them. Some may have set up official-looking roadblocks and toll stations on the road, and equipped themselves with quite official-looking credentials. Even if the taxes have not been postponed, someone might still be playing this trick: they might be simple criminals, or they might be supporters of the Sons of Ulric taking the opportunity to raise funds for that cause. There are angry scenes at the real tax assessment points as visitors protest that they have already paid, only to learn that they were duped — and that the road is outside the jurisdiction of the City Watch and local tax officials, neither of whom do anything about the false tax collectors.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>A Few Small Formalities</h3>\n<p>Eventually, the party reaches the head of the queue. At the gate or chair-lift they are assessed for tax by a gate-sergeant — who, they notice, also checks those leaving the city. The sergeant is backed up by enough guards to make most characters think twice about causing trouble.</p>\n<p>Dwarfs, and characters who are obviously wizards or priests are taken to one side. Everyone else who is not obviously a local peasant is asked: ‘<em>Are you now, or have you ever been, a wizard or a priest?’</em></p>\n<p>Those who answer ‘<em>yes</em>’ are sent to one side and are assessed for tax (@JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{The Taxes}). Those who answer ‘no’ are searched. Evidence of any spellcasting ability, including spell components and the like, means that the Character must pay the appropriate tax. If the Characters resist, they are arrested: they are stripped of cash and/or belongings to the value of the tax owing, plus a fine of several Gold Crowns (3-10 would be appropriate, as everyone assumes anyone trying to avoid the taxes  has money), and taken to the road, with a warning not to come back.</p>\n<p>Finally, those Dwarfs, wizards, and priests who have paid the tax are sent before a scribe who records their name, home town, date and time of entry, and general appearance before being admitted to the city. If the scribe is feeling generous, he or she may also give them a warning about the Old Quarter: ‘<em>Be warned that the south part of the east gate is frequented by criminals. Go there at your own risk.’</em></p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Getting In</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Veterans of the first edition Enemy Within campaign will probably expect to face bottlenecks and delays on the way into the city, which gives the GM the opportunity to surprise them. In a concession to the increased traffic in the build-up to Carnival week, the party is simply waved through, with the only formality being that their coachman must give the names of all his passengers, and where they boarded the coach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">The Characters may sigh with relief, thinking that they have saved a lot of time and a little money — but that is only half true. There are tax officials posted at every inn: they work in teams of two, and are accompanied Guards wearing the city’s insignia. Everyone is assessed, and taxes are levied, when they take a room in an inn. Names are checked against a list collected at the gates, for example, from coach drivers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Astute Players realise that this is a golden opportunity to try to evade the taxes by giving false names or simply looking for a place to stay that does not have a couple of tax officials waiting for newcomers. They are welcome to try: after many hours of walking around the city and some close calls — for there are inns where even tax men fear to tread, but these are just as dangerous (and unsanitary) for a group of out-of-towners — the Characters may decide that a bed for the night is worth paying taxes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">If they continue to try to evade the tax officials, though, they may notice a couple of familiar faces following them about town. Everywhere they go, these two are fighting through the crowds, trying to catch up with the party and even calling out the name of one of the characters. Page 60 has rules for conducting chases in the crowded city, which work as well for Characters trying to evade pursuit as they do for cultists and others trying to evade the Characters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Finally, after hours or days, the Characters find themselves in circumstances that make escape impossible: a dead-end alley or some other place in which they have no choice but to face their pursuers. Perhaps they are no more than dogged officials determined to do their duty, or perhaps they are more than they seem. They might be genuine tax officials — or at least, they might look like genuine tax officials — but rather than wanting money from the Characters, they have something valuable to give to them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Exactly what this might be is for the GM to determine, depending on what the Characters have been up to before they found themselves cornered, but it might be a valuable object, or it might be vital information relating to one of their lines of inquiry, or an invitation from a major NPC (which, as will be seen in the following chapters, is worth several times its weight in gold).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">The pursuers might even be loyal cultists of the Purple Hand, who want to welcome the Magister Impedimentae to Middenheim, and place the cult’s resources and safe houses at his (or her) disposal for the duration of the Carnival, since </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">the Magister Magistri is detained by an important </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">project and cannot give his colleague the welcome that </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">courtesy demands.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/chair-lifts.webp","folder":"9l20ogJKAnhkPnIw","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":500000}}}

He is the husband to Rhya, and father to Manaan, and is perceived by Taalites to be the king of the gods, though other cults dispute this. All nature is under his purview, from the snaking rivers to the tallest mountains, from the smallest insect to the greatest beast. He is normally portrayed as a powerfully built, virile man with long, wild hair and great spreading antlers, and is known for his volatile moods and his need to hunt.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Rural folk across the Old World venerate Taal, and any who make their living in wild places take care not to offend him. Taal is the patron deity of Talabecland in the Empire, where his cult holds significant sway, influencing all levels of society.</p>\n<p>Taal’s cult has a variety of smaller orders dedicated to holy sites and groves throughout the Old World, but two orders drive the cult forwards. The Order of the Antler are the priests of the cult, who are tasked to teach Taal’s ways and protect the wild places from intrusion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These Taalites are particularly widespread in Talabecland, and their forest temples are hubs of activity for rural folk. The Longshanks are a mix of warrior-priest and templar who typically wander as individuals, cleansing Taal’s wild places of corruption and ensuring rural communities do nothing to upset Father Taal.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Normally, temples to Taal are small, rustic affairs, built of wood and rough stone in a manner unchanged for countless centuries. They are usually sited close to natural features of wonder such as waterfalls, swirling pools, and mountains, and often have small sweat lodges attached. The high temple of Taal in Talabheim is something of an anomaly when compared to this. It appears more a well-maintained, albeit wild, noble garden than a temple, and huge services are held there under the spreading rowan trees weekly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Officially, the Hierarch leads the cult from there, though he spends most of his time in the wild groves of the nearby Taalgrunhaar Forest. Shrines to Taal are barely structures at all. Some old trees are regarded as sacred, and offerings pile up at their bases. Caves, forest groves, and other natural places are also used as shrines, and usually only a local or a devout follower of Taal can find them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Taal’s penances usually involve clearing diseased or mutated monsters from wild areas, replanting sacred trees, and maintaining groves important to the cult. A cultist might also be ordered to climb a high mountain and leave a stone on a cairn at the top, or clear an obstruction at the top of a waterfall. Whatever the specific task that must be undertaken, Taal’s penances almost always challenge the cultist to survive in the wild.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><em>Strictures</em></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Offer a prayer of thanks for every animal taken.</em></li>\n<li><em>Spend a week alone communing with the wilderness every year.</em></li>\n<li><em>Eschew metal armour; clad yourself in the hides of Taal.</em></li>\n<li><em>Rely on your own skill, not the advances of gunpowder or cold technology.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never harm an animal except in self-defence or for food or sacrifice.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Blessing of Hardiness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.eBRjKAF6U0yR0KK8]{Blessing of Savagery}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.By5dc8Q7ZAGpr177]{Blessing of The Hunt}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.SZ88OXYo6F2q3vWb]{Animal Instincts}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.n8MfaJhczROmscCR]{King of the Wild}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.mXKrxO8WRZ9QLHA6]{Leaping Stag}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.JxmIQjVuoPcQnyPF]{Lord of the Hunt}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ONz21FviMRk3AyvE]{Tanglefoot}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.PcKMAEF6UoaPSK6d]{Tooth and Claw}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/taal.webp","folder":"NkiXlTQtgNkW3FMs","sort":1000001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"}}}

{"_id":"RoNPATyfG4PHQBZa","name":"The Aethyr","content":"<p>Magical abilities mark you as a figure of terror and awe in the Empire. Prior to the establishment of the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, those able to wield magic were reviled outlaws. Nowadays being a witch is not illegal, but casting magic without a licence is. Spellcasters within the Empire must either study at the Colleges of Magic, refrain from casting spells, or hope no-one notices their illicit activity. Even licenced wizards are generally feared and avoided — legal status has done nothing to reduce the superstitious dread of the common folk.</p>\n<p>Magic is seen as unnatural and is notorious for its darker elements: the crippling hexes of witchcraft, the raising of the dead, and the summoning of Daemonic entities. Even when practiced according to the teaching of the Colleges, magic can be the cause of trouble. The very source of magic is unstable, and even the most experienced spellcaster can lose focus, resulting in dangerous accidents and unexpected side-effects.</p>\n<h2>THE AETHYR</h2>\n<p>Scholars of magic derive their learning from the Elves, who explained the source of all magical power is the Aethyr. This infinite dimension, said to be the spawning ground of daemons and spirits, exists beyond the physical world. The Elves taught that far to the north of the Empire, a great ragged wound was torn through the fabric of the world to the Aethyr, and it bleeds raw magic. These roiling energies — known as the Winds of Magic — blow throughout the world, gathering and eddying in great heavenly whorls, only to rain down and permeate the land and the creatures dwelling upon it. It is these powerful winds that wizards and witches use to fuel their spells.</p>\n<h3>The Winds Of Magic</h3>\n<p>As magical power bursts into the mortal realm and sweeps down from the north, it splinters and separates, like light splitting through a prism. The Colleges of Magic state this creates eight discrete Winds referred to by colour, each with its own character and strengths. The Elves support this, teaching the same eight winds to their apprentices before moving on to more powerful magics.</p>\n<p>Only a small minority of Humans can perceive the Winds, and even fewer can bend them to their will. Most Elves are sensitive to them, and many possess the ability to see the Winds clearly — commonly known as Second Sight, or just the Sight — with many also able to learn how to cast magic. Dwarfs disdain magic, perhaps because they are partially immune to it, and no Dwarf wizards are known. Halflings are largely indifferent towards magic: except when it delivers impressive or entertaining spectacles.</p>\n<p>The Elves directed (as a condition of their tuition) that Human spellcasters should each only use a single Wind of Magic. They argued that while it is possible to cast spells by drawing from multiple winds, doing so is a risky proposition for the feeble, corruptible Human mind. This wisdom has been adopted by the Colleges, and each specialises in a single colour. </p>\n<p>Some witches outside the College system consider these restrictions ludicrous, an attempt by the Elves to keep the most powerful magics to themselves. Drawing on multiple winds is a quick route to power, but also to damnation. Many an unlicensed witch has proved unable to resist this temptation, a practice usually called Dark Magic, only to be brought low by Witch Hunters. </p>\n<p>Others believe magical energies are not so easily categorised. Many different types of ‘wizard’ and ‘witch’ can be found throughout the Old World, with some practicing magic that seems to lie outside colour magic, such as the cold-hearted Ice Witches of Kislev, or the shamans and sorcerers found amongst some of the other species besetting the Empire, such as the Greenskins.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>What Is The Aethyr?</em></h3>\n<p><em>There is much heated debate between ‘experts’ on the nature of magic. The lecture halls of the Empire’s most learned institutions often see ambitious scholars expound on their latest theories. Some liken magic to the backstage of a theatre, a mass of mechanisms, props, and hidden pulleys responsible for the drama viewed by the audience. Others resort to mathematical metaphors, complete with incomprehensible esoteric diagrams. Although such may end with an air of confident finality, it will only be met with polite coughs, raised hands, and a litany of objections and exceptions.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Language of Magic</h3>\n<p>The Winds of Magic may blow through all things incessantly, but they are relatively harmless until harnessed by the Language of Magick. For reasons not fully understood, when certain sounds are uttered by those attuned to magic, the Winds answer. The Colleges of Magic teach a complex language called the lingua praestantia which form the basis of their spells, originally taught to Humanity by the Elves. Although extraordinarily difficult to correctly annunciate, it is a significant simplification of the Elven tongue Anoqeyån , the language used by the Elves to shape their own, more powerful magics. Wizards of the Colleges and the Elves are not alone in their knowledge of the Language of Magick. Its complex forms are also spoken by many magical creatures found across the Old World, including Spirits and Daemons. Many witches seem to instinctively understand the language, almost as if it somehow wormed inside them, begging to be spoken as a spell.</p>\n<h3>The Eight Lores</h3>\n<p>Each of the eight Winds of Magic has an associated Lore, a body of spells and knowledge its adepts use. Each of the eight Colleges of Magic is dedicated to the study of a single Lore, and their buildings are constructed to focus their Wind to facilitate relatively safe tuition. </p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[X6qhaU9mesSLjk0w]{The Lore of Light}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[btmw3WI2twBw7LmR]{The Lore of Metal}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[rbfM7InGHoJoiZBy]{The Lore of Life}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[eZWLEgOLSXUUuBEl]{The Lore of Heavens}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[QSQgs7mj3Kru82Yw]{The Lore of Shadows}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[NYgZFfxWQ1BldMni]{The Lore of Death}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[h36SjjE3TnCQC3ow]{The Lore of Fire}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Hq0PrEh4AcTO2DZ3]{The Lore of Beasts}</p>\n<h3>Elven Magic</h3>\n<p>Elves are long lived beings whose minds are more attuned to the workings of magic than those of humanity. High Elven mages usually train in several, sometimes all, of the eight winds as part of their apprenticeships, before the most promising move on to study High Magic: Qhaysh . This is the blending of multiple winds of magic together into a blinding, coruscating energy. This magic is impressive and difficult, and Elves claim it is beyond the capacity of humankind. </p>\n<p>The Wood Elves, too, make use of the eight Winds of Magic, though their Spellsingers usually focus upon the Jade and Amber Winds. The most powerful usually go on to study either High Magic like High Elves, or dread Dark Magic – a foul mixing of the eight winds that can create tremendously destructive effects.</p>\n<h3>Dark Magic</h3>\n<p>While difficult to master Qhaysh is the safe blending of multiple Winds of Magic, Dhar , known commonly as Dark Magic, is much more dangerous method of casting spells using multiple winds. It is usually only practiced by evil sorcerers, Necromancers, and powerful witches, offering them a seductive source of raw power, yet one laced with terrible side-effects. Few can channel Dhar for long, without succumbing to the corrupting influence of the malevolent wind, their bodies and minds being warped into unnatural states. </p>\n<p>Dhar resembles a stagnant mire to those with the Sight, pooling in places saturated with evil, or corruption: the herdstones of Beastmen, the dark idols of chaos cultists, and places where great workings of several of the Winds of Magic took place. Dhar is so dense and potent that it can independently coalesce or crystalize into physical matter, eventually forming the widely feared substance called warpstone.</p>\n<h4>Warpstone</h4>\n<p>Warpstone is a lump of pure magic in the material plane. Its unnatural provenance is immediately obvious to all who see it, as it hurts the eyes and mutates anything drawing close for too long. Although its form varies, it often holds hard facets like flint, and radiates a queasy green glow.</p>\n<p>Close examination of the substance is not to be undertaken lightly. Warpstone is the stuff of Chaos made manifest and its presence is deeply corrupting. Those who have direct contact with warpstone risk illness, madness and mutation, and anyone who ingests so much as a pinch of the stuff dooms themselves to catastrophic warping of body and mind. Nonetheless, the world is full of reckless, ambitious fools who know that the volatile and dangerous substance is a tremendous source of energy for spells and rituals.</p>\n<p>The followers of Chaos and the Skaven do not hesitate to use it. To them, warpstone is a literal gift from the gods to be valued above gold and jewels, and to be used against their enemies.</p>\n<h3>Other Lores</h3>\n<p>In less frequented corners of the Empire, in villages and rural communities far from the influence of the Colleges of Magic, older forms of magic are still practiced even though they are outlawed and punishable by death. There are uncounted varieties of these, but two of the more common Lores still practised by Humans are Hedgecraft and Witchcraft.</p>\n<h4>The Lore of Hedgecraft</h4>\n<p>Practitioners of Hedgecraft generally live quiet lives on the fringes of smaller human settlements, in service to local communities. Just as they live their lives in the ‘hedge’ between civilisation and the wilds of nature, so much of their magic concerns itself with the liminal space between the material world and the realm of the spirits.  Their magic tends to focus on folklore, spirits and the natural world, as well as means to aid the rural communities which shelter them. Once a relatively common sight in the Empire, over two centuries of persecution since the founding of the Colleges of Magic has all but wiped them out. </p>\n<h4>The Lore of Witchcraft</h4>\n<p>While the Lore of Witchcraft is not inherently malicious, or tied to the gods of Chaos, it has a justly earned reputation for evil and unpleasantness. Often self-taught and using multiple Winds of Magic, those practising the Lore of Witchcraft lack the discipline or knowledge of College wizards and are at a significant risk of corruption. The combination of the corrosive effects of Dhar and being shunned by right-minded folk of the Empire often makes these Witches bitter, spiteful souls, their hearts hard and flinty, their gaze baleful and ill-omened.</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/winds.webp","folder":"SV4wmXUvuCNwQ0Nc","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Magic"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Magic","sort":200001}}}

These can range from stumbling over a tent-peg hidden in the grass to dodging a passing servant who has stumbled while carrying a tray of food or drink, or rescuing a skittish elderly aristocrat from a bee. If the Characters have made enemies already — or if some of the attending servants, who are greater snobs than their masters, decide that these upstart adventurers need to be taken down a peg or two — the Characters  might also have to contend with petty acts of sabotage such as drinks laced with pepper, subtle pushes and trips, and deliberately wrong advice on the way to make a good impression on a particular NPC.</em></p>\n<p><em>For players who enjoy social interaction, the Garden Party can be played out in full, filling an entire session of play.

Although the event is billed as an exhibition rather than a contest, competition between the various participants is keen with competitors getting quite snippy. Everyone is watching the wizards of the Jade Order, and the Wood Elves of Laurelorn, in particular.

{"_id":"S7IFBB02D4GQ0gBI","name":"The Reik","content":"<p>The Reik carries more traffic and trade than all the other rivers in the Old World combined. Indeed, so massive is the river that almost half the fresh water of the Old World ﬂows down its length, for it not only drains all the Reikland with its many tributaries, but most of the Empire beyond. By the time the Reik ﬂows into the Reikland, it is already so wide it frequently appears more lake than river, leaving it impossible to bridge using standard engineering methods. As this immense watercourse approaches @JournalEntry[Altdorf] to meet the dark waters of the Talabec, both rivers split into a complex network of channels that spread outwards to form the foggy @JournalEntry[Altdorf Flats]. Many of the thinner distributaries caused by this are bridgeable, ensuring Altdorf is a natural center for trade as it is the only place where the Reik can be crossed on foot for many hundreds of miles. This single fact has secured Altdorf&rsquo;s dominance of the area, both militarily and fiscally.</p>\n<p>Beyond the Altdorf Flats, the boggy channels reconverge and the Reik begins its long journey westwards to the sea. By this point, it is so wide the opposite bank sometimes slips into mist, and is so deep that even the largest sea-faring vessel can navigate without fear. Resultingly, warships of the Imperial Navy, some so large to have crews out-numbering the populations of smaller towns, not only patrol these waters, but are built there, most launching from the Reiksport, a deep-water harbour built on the shores of @JournalEntry[Altdorf] .

She is as snobbish as the Players remember her, and absolutely refuses to allow members of the lower classes to sit in the same coach with her, or to keep her from a room that she clearly needs, when such riff-raff as the Characters can clearly make do with the common room or a gutter.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the tables could be turned: the Characters might rescue her from the wreck of a coach that has suffered an accident or an attack on the road. Mutants and Beastmen are an ever-present danger, even on a well-travelled road such as the highway between Altdorf and Middenheim. Other threats include the militant @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{Sons of Ulric}, to whom Lady Isolde is unlikely to endear herself with her southern accent and high-handed attitude. Do not expect her to change her personality, though: she rewards the Characters for any help they give her, as befits a lady of her station, but once that transaction is complete — and she regards it as no more than a transaction — she sees no reason why anything should change between them. No matter what experiences they may have shared, she remains a lady and the Characters remain… well, whatever they are.</p>\n<p>Lady Isolde can pop up from time to time during the Carnival, impeding the Characters when they are in a hurry or getting into various kinds of trouble just as they are passing by with something more urgent on their minds. In the latter case, she recognises them and calls out imperiously for their aid: after all, the purpose of the lower classes is to serve the upper, and she has relied upon the Characters before.

They are consulted by Graf Boris and his other advisors on any matters in which magical skills may be important, especially to the security of the city.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>Leaders of the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Grand Guild of Wizards}, consulted by the Graf on all magical matters, especially relating to security.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Both magicians live in the Guild House, but Eberhauer also has a small town house in the select Ulricsmund district. Neither is married. Both attend some Carnival events, most notably the Black Pool Illuminations, which they are responsible for organising. Janna Eberhauer is notably more sociable than the High Wizard, and is easier to encounter about the city.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Wizards receive a +10 bonus to all tests based on Fellowship, except for apprentices and practitioners of forbidden magic.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>The magicians don’t have much to do with politics, although they do have a little influence with the Graf. Eberhauer is somewhat more worldly than Helseher, who is only now really waking up to matters of state; he has made angry representations to Graf Boris about the Scroll Tax. They know little of value to the Characters, but are sure that Law Lords Ehrlich and Hoflich must both have voted for the tax laws as the Guild's spyes at the palace have reported that Wasmeier vocally opposed them.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>The wizards think that both they and the Marshals have more influence on Graf Boris than they actually do, although Helseher is beginning to wonder about this given the imposition of the Scroll Tax and the lack of results to his furious but reasoned protests. Graf Boris seemed very sympathetic at the time, but someone must have changed his mind.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>The repeal of the Scroll Tax is a major priority, providing that it does not undermine the city’s security. If the Characters can credibly promise to do something about this specific tax (the magicians don’t care much about the others), they may win the wizards over. In any initial encounter, though, Helseher will give as little away as possible, while pumping the Characters for all the information he can get.</p>\n<p>Even the Characters befriend the wizards, they will not be lent or given any Guild resources, such as magic items or magical training: these are reserved for members, and there is a lengthy application and vetting process that cannot be circumvented. However, the wizards may agree to cast some minor spell (such as identifying a magic item) or perform some other trifling magical service on their own initiative.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Both suspect him of being behind the Scroll Tax. Helseher regards him as able, clever, but very detached (rather like himself, though Helseher does not see this). Janna Eberhauer is still seething about his unwelcome advances at their recent meeting; both will agree, if asked, that this behaviour was very much out of character.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: No dealings with him, although Eberhauer knows of his engagement to Kirsten Jung.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: No dealings, but Eberhauer (who is a moderate flautist) cares for his music and — unknown to the Minstrel — considers him rather attractive.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — the ‘Princess’</strong>: No dealings. They will talk vaguely about her, in an offhand way.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: No dealings, but Helseher will commend her many years of service to the Graf ’s family.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Infrequent meetings to discuss security. Helseher is pleased by their intelligence, but relationships are only professional.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Very few dealings. Helseher thinks him rather weak, Eberhauer disagrees and considers him wise and without malice. Both agree that he is fairly tolerant and decent. They have not seen him for some time, and know nothing of his affair or his anxieties.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ybdS4Z0pbWL8oiND]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Helseher knows nothing of any paramour, and cannot name any of the ladies. Eberhauer does not know which of them is involved with the Graf. Eberhauer sometimes meets Petra Liebkosen for a late-night cocktail at a good hostelry; they have become fair, if unlikely, friends. She has rarely met the others, but reasons that if @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — a very decent man — is engaged to Kirsten Jung, then Kirsten must be a good sort.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Both of them think he is an idiot.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Helseher knows nothing about him. Eberhauer knows his general reputation; she would like to meet him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: The magicians have no links with the world of commerce, and have heard no rumours about him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: They do not know him, and largely dismiss the rumours about him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: They like Wasmeier — a fellow wizard — but do not know Ehrlich or Hoflich. However, they blame them for the Scroll Tax. Wasmeier told them he was against it, but was overruled by the other two and dared not break ranks to oppose it openly.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer: </strong>Rothbert has several wizardly acquaintances at the Guild, who sometimes look to@JournalEntry[CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{‘The Man’} and his agents to source rare or illicit spell ingredients. Eberhauer knows him, but politely ignores him in public.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>High Wizard Albrecht Helseher despises Breugal, seeing a man with neither temporal nor magical power who struts and lords it over his betters. Deputy High Wizard Janna Eberhauer takes a more practical view, and regards the necessity of staying on the chamberlain’s good side in much the same light as she might regard the proper treatment of volatile alchemical ingredients.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>The Wizards know the High Priestess is the most sympathetic of the city’s priests and they appreciate having access to the excellent temple library. Helsheher likes Mueller and they have lively philosophical debates. Eberhauer is cordial, but has never warmed to Mueller’s personality.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>They’re glad she’s there, but have few dealings with the Shallyans.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<h4>Albrecht Helseher</h4>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>:<em> @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{A Knight’s Midsummer Dream}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Flying Displays}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Finale)}</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Janna Eberhauer</h4>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Gymnasts}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Recitals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Lightsingers}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Horse Fair}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Flying Displays}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants and Jousting}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>\n<h3>The Wizards at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>Albrecht Helseher is a difficult man to encounter; his commitments at the Carnival are few, and he spends most of his remaining time sequestered in the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{guild house}, preparing arguments against the Scroll Tax and aspects of the other taxes that impact Middenheim’s wizards. He may be interested in any proof that the taxes are part of a plan to weaken the city, but requires convincing proof before he acts.</p>\n<p>Janna Eberhauer is more active socially, and can be encountered at various artistic events around the city. She is fairly approachable, especially if one or more Characters have taken the trouble to join the guild since arriving in Middenheim. She is not interested in romantic advances, but listens to any Character who speaks to her as a respected wizard. She also gives the benefit of the doubt to anyone who is brought to her by her sister @Actor[ThOmnHA3l1Slh78K]{Erina}, who is staying at the @JournalEntry[ieHrUyFz83TkBikg]{Templar’s Arms} when the scheduled event @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{‘Chaos Strikes by Night’} takes place. If the Characters can convince Janna that there is a sinister plot behind the new taxes, she reviews their evidence carefully. She takes it to Helseher, if she thinks it is sufficient to convince him to act; if not, she advises the Characters on how to proceed, whom to cultivate, and what information is needed. You should take care not to let her operate the party by remote control, though; she should be a useful source of hints rather than a skeleton key to unlock the whole adventure.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Janna can provide an introduction to @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Helseher}, but only if she thinks the party has irrefutable evidence to support their assertions.

In the Old World, breaking one’s sworn word is considered bad form and carries significant social ramifications. no-one trusts oath breakers, meaning your Status is reduced by 1 (see page 49). Powerful and dangerous folks tend to take it very, very poorly if someone refuses a Favour owed them, so bloody consequences may follow.</p>\n<p>The powerful often find it is far more useful to have various individuals owing them Favours than merely soliciting money in return for their help. What’s more, it can be an investment: help a student today, call in a favour from a successful Lawyer years later. Favours may be referred to as ‘boons’, ‘services’, or ‘obligations’ by different folk, but in the end, they all amount to the same.</p>\n<p>Favours come in three levels: Minor, Major, and Significant. Regardless of a Favour’s level, in almost all cases, the person owed the Favour will take into account the capabilities and sensibilities of the person they’re asking. There’s no point in demanding that a Priestess of Shallya assassinate a merchant, for example, even if she does owe you a Significant Favour. That being said, Favours are ripe for NPCs to exploit in order to put pressure on your moral compass.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• A<strong> Minor Favour</strong> represents a simple task that can be completed in no more than a few hours. Perhaps you need volunteer at a Shallyan mercy-house or put in a good word for someone. With the GM’s permission, you may undertake an Endeavour to pay off this favour.</p>\n<p>• <strong>A Major Favour</strong> is a more time-consuming or risky undertaking. It could take up to several weeks to achieve and may involve travel. Perhaps you are needed to act as lookout on a string of burglaries, to convince the Stevedores’ and Teamsters’ Guild to back down from a guild war, or to transport a package to a different city. With the GM’s permission, you may undertake two or more consecutive Endeavours to pay off this favour.</p>\n<p>• <strong>A Significant Favour</strong> is relatively rare and will almost certainly involve risking life and limb. Months of travel may be involved, and major violence is likely. Perhaps you will be asked to eliminate a rival gang boss, wipe out a Goblin encampment, or instigate a riot. Significant Favours cannot be paid off via Endeavours; they are roleplayed out as full adventures.</p>","folder":"5PMBVwnydUMSobIr","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Endeavours"}}}

She is generally depicted as a tall, classically beautiful woman, and usually carries a sword and a set of scales. As the patron of justice she is concerned with fairness rather than the letter of the law: she opposes tyranny and oppression as much as crime.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Verena is worshipped throughout the Old World, especially in the south. Her devout followers include scholars, lawyers, and magistrates, as well as some wizards of the Colleges of Magic, particularly of the Grey and Light orders.</p>\n<p>The cult of Verena has no rigid hierarchy: it is said that Verena alone heads the cult, and no mortal intermediary is needed because truth is self-evident and requires no interpretation. Temple priests from the Order of Lorekeepers are tasked to preserve knowledge and communicate it to the community. They keep up a voluminous correspondence with each other, exchanging information and news.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Priests from the equally influential Order of Scalebearers are much sought after to act as judges, arbitrators, and go-betweens, because of their famed impartiality and mastery of the law. The Order of Mysteries is much smaller and less well-known, and contains warrior-priests who seek lost and forgotten lore, wherever it may lie. The last major order is the Knights of the Everlasting Light, templars famed for their sword skills, sense of fairness, and legendary bad luck. Verena’s cultists usually wear plain white robes, symbolic of pure truth and impartiality.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Temples to Verena can be found in most cities and larger towns, generally situated in the administrative or university quarters. Most libraries and court-houses include a shrine to the goddess, and smaller shrines can be found in the homes of many scholars and lawyers. Temples usually have colonnaded facades, with symbols of the goddess and allegorical figures of learning presented in low relief. Inside is a large statue of Verena, normally seated with a book in her lap, a pair of scales in her left hand, and her right hand resting on the hilt of a sword. Smaller rooms lead off from the main temple, including a library and chambers for the attendant priests.

After plying the peasant with drink, the trapper claimed he had a map that detailed the location of a strange tree with multicoloured leaves. It was located in the woods a few miles from the inn. The trapper told Felix that there was a hoard of precious gems buried under the tree. He sold the map to Felix for 13 shillings and a bone handled knife. The drunken peasant proudly told anyone in the inn who would listen that he was going to be richer than everyone else. He used the last of his money on upgrading to a private room. He proudly told the innkeeper that his luck had changed and it was time to live the high life.</p>\n<p>The trapper decided to get an early night and retired to his room. He left at dawn the next day before the gullible peasant awoke. The trapper knew the treasure map was a load of old nonsense and wanted to put as much distance as possible between himself and its new owner. Felix sobered up the next day with a pounding headache and he realized he had paid all his money for the map. He gathered his few remaining possessions and left the inn.</p>\n<p>He made his way into the woods with the map as his guide. After a few hours of traipsing through the woods, a dehydrated Felix eventually found the tree with the strangely coloured branches. After taking a swig of water, he offered a prayer to Ranald, took out his axe and started to dig. He dug for many hours but found nothing but dirt and worms. Angry and ashamed of his own stupidity he lashed out at the tree in a violent rage, only stopping when there was little more than a broken trunk and hacked branches.</p>\n<p>Felix quickly made his way back to the inn before nightfall.

He sends divine ravens to guide dead souls to the Portal, the pillared gateway between the mortal realms and the realm of the gods. He then leads each soul from there to its final resting place: either Morr’s Underworld, or the afterlife of another god. He is commonly portrayed as a tall, dark-haired man of aristocratic bearing, with a brooding, intense air.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Outside Ostermark, where Morr has special importance, few wish to attract the God of Death’s attention, so normally only the bereaved pray to him. However, those desperate or brave enough may pray for dreams of what the future may bring, though it is said he rarely divulges anything not associated with dying.</p>\n<p>The Order of the Shroud dominates the cult, directly controlling all other orders and the Mourners’ Guild, those responsible for overseeing burials and burial grounds. Supporting them, the Black Guard are the cult’s largest templar order, tasked to guard temples and hunt down the Undead. The Order&nbsp;of Augurs may be small, but it guides the leadership&nbsp;</p>\n<p>with its foretellings, and organises the Order of Doomsayers: these wandering priests of Morr tour the land performing Doomings for all Human children on their tenth year. Bringing them all together, every decade a grand convocation of the priesthood of Morr is held at Luccini in Tilea, where the future for the cult is discussed around city-wide festivities.</p>\n<p>All Morr’s clerics wear plain, black, hooded robes without adornment or trimming.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Temples of Morr are within Gardens of Morr: great graveyards wrapped with black roses that bloom all year, and are rarely used for anything other than funeral services. Most are plain structures of dark stone, distinguished by a broad doorway with a heavy lintel-stone — representing Morr’s Portal. The doors are always open, like the doors to the Kingdom of Death.&nbsp; Inside, the temples are bare. Any necessary furniture and other equipment is kept in storage until it is needed for a funeral service. Shrines to Morr also take the form of a gateway, usually consisting of two plain pillars and a lintel. In some cases, one pillar is white marble and the other black basalt.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Morr’s penances typically involve hunting Necromancers and destroying Undead, or finding and restoring burial places and holy sites fallen to disuse and disrepair. He also occasionally requires servants of Khaine be stopped from fulfilling their dark deeds.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>Strictures</strong></em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Respect and protect the dead.</em></li>\n<li><em>Hunt down Necromancers and the Undead wherever they may gather.</em></li>\n<li><em>Pay heed to your dreams.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never refuse to conduct a funeral service.</em></li>\n<li><em>At no time be a party to raising the dead, unless allowed by Morr.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessing</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iIfYOlNrLb0uiV8c]{Blessing of Fortune}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.2WN0muIB2BFd4kBO]{Blessing of Righteousness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Blessing of Tenacity}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.FRkIz2sR7ZC92W2G]{Blessing of Wisdom}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0AQheUiRtffqfKNg]{Death Mask}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.sdSy4k7ygDhAjSSX]{Destroy Undead}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.itARFNqBAbwNDAAy]{Dooming}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.rbdxcYoj8N2eMaqV]{Last Rites}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.uE6AXjMjYvtvXQvy]{Portal's Threshold}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.SjKFVBXgLC51dnQz]{Stay Morr's Hand}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/morr.webp","folder":"NkiXlTQtgNkW3FMs","sort":400001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"}}}

Groups of cells are organised under the auspices of three governing Ordos. These are the <strong>Ordo Impedimentae</strong>, the <strong>Ordo Novitiae</strong>, and the <strong>Ordo Terribilis</strong>.<span style=\"font-family: ACaslonPro-Regular; font-size: 9pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><br style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /></span></li>\n<li>The Magistri of a branch will meet on occasion for certain ceremonies (keeping their identity a secret).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Ordo Impedimentae</h3>\n<p>The Ordo Impedimentae are tasked with securing funds and resources for the cult. Their members fulfil the roles of treasurer and quartermaster, and stand at the apex of a wider network involving burglary and racketeering. Whilst the Ordo Impedimentae operates like an organised criminal gang they must be exceedingly careful. Regular criminals benefit from a loose but mutually supportive code of conduct, but only the most depraved crime lord would consider extending such niceties to followers of Chaos. Criminals must be wary of alerting the town guard, but they don&rsquo;t normally have to worry about the more meticulous investigations of witch hunters.</p>\n<h3>The Ordo Novitiae</h3>\n<p>The Ordo Novitiae are concerned with scouting for talent and recruiting new members. Whilst they do occasionally resort to blackmail or force, hard lessons have taught them to identify and recruit true believers, rather than attempt to coerce people into the worship of Tzeentch. The members of this Ordo have to be particularly ruthless and hard-nosed, as it falls to them to silence any cult novice who turns out to be a security risk.</p>\n<h3>The Ordo Terribilis</h3>\n<p>The Ordo Terribilis handle research and development for the cult. They instruct magically adept members of the cult in the rituals and spells of Tzeentch, consort with Daemons, and study forbidden lore. Given the limited pool of expertise available to the cult, the Ordo Terribilis in each major city focuses on a particular field. In Nuln they carry out a sociological experiment encouraging mutants to build communities within the confines of the city. In Middenheim they experiment on fusing the dark arts of the Daemonologist with those of the Necromancer.</p>\n<h3>Leadership</h3>\n<p>Each Ordo is headed by three <strong>Magistri</strong>, who tend to be accomplished in another useful field (such as wizards, scholars, or assassins) or who have worked their way into a position of authority outside of the cult (such as guild chairpersons or members of the aristocracy). Together the Magistri from the three Ordos form an<strong> Inner Circle</strong> of nine.</p>\n<p>Within the Inner Circle the individual heads of each of the Ordos form a governing council known as the Triumvirate.</p>\n<p>At the top of the hierarchy the Triumvirate elect one of their members to be the regional cult leader: <strong>Magister Magistri</strong>.</p>\n<p>The cult&rsquo;s inner circle are usually ignorant of each other&rsquo;s identities. They meet only twice a year on Hexenstag and Geheimisnacht, when Morrslieb waxes full. Donning cult robes and elaborate masks, they share their achievements and draw up plans for the next phase. On ending their business, they undertake forbidden rites, sing praises to Tzeentch and conclude with a human sacrifice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many secret societies in the Empire who work in good faith to promote needful reforms. Unfortunately, such groups provide the Purple Hand with rich recruiting opportunities, as well as a degree of cover for their more sinister plots. All too often witch hunters have put na&iuml;ve revolutionaries to the flames whilst true Chaos followers escape. Characters may find themselves drawn into reformist movements only to discover that they are being manipulated by darker designs.</li>\n<li>Cult meetings held on nights when Morrslieb is full present witch hunters with their only real opportunity to catch a number of cultists at the same time. Were the characters to learn about such a cult meeting they could be richly rewarded, and offered a chance to join in the effort to capture the inner circle at work.</li>\n<li>Cult gatherings are an opportunity for Purple Hand members to update their recognition codes, a series of gestures by which they identify co-conspirators. Some cultists with imperfect memories might make note of these codes.

{"_id":"TtjfBS0C0YlVYZBW","name":"The Ritual","content":"<p>This adventure can be used as a diversion or a way to fill time when the Characters are in Middenheim. It pits the party against Skaven and their Human allies, and offers a good way to introduce the cultists of the Yellow Fang and the Skaven activity beneath the city.</p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>@Actor[XviXu9z4RMAv0tmo]{Grey Seer Skretth} is insane: a renegade Skaven with an impossible goal. He controls a small group of loyal but misguided Clan Skyre warriors. Recently, he and his group infiltrated the Undercity through a forgotten entrance that was not shown on any Skaven map — Skretth looks upon it as fate.</p>\n<p>The Grey Seer has become obsessed with Necromancy. He has even spent some time observing a Human Necromancer, but Skretth’s heavy use of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.5fowsr8vslorjeB2]{mandrake root} did not help his understanding of the experiments he witnessed. Instead, he formed a crazed theory: that the power of magic and the life-force were the same thing, and therefore that warpstone, as the greatest source of magic (in Skaven eyes, at least) holds the secret of life and death. Corollary to this theory was the proposition that the life-force of every living thing could be extracted from its body in the form of warpstone. He needs only to perfect the process.</p>\n<p>The prospect of an unlimited source of warpstone — and therefore, of an unlimited source of power — turned the Grey Seer’s brain. Amid visions of conquering the Skaven, and then the world, he set about a series of disturbed experiments intended to discover the process by which his theoretical goal might be achieved. The Undercity has provided him with an opportunity to collect specimens and practise rituals for his flawed quest. Human cultists in the town, members of the Skaven-worshipping Yellow Fang cult, are aiding Skretth in his mission.</p>\n<p>The adventure leads the Characters into the @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Undercity}. They discover that a band of Skaven has recently taken up residence there and, with the aid of Human servants, is carrying out bizarre rituals and sacrifices to the foul Skaven deity, the Horned Rat. The Characters must try to eradicate the Skaven, or at least drive them out, and save a wealthy citizen from their clutches in the process. The Skaven presence is significant, so the Characters will need their wits about them: repeatedly choosing to fight will lead to a swift and bloody demise!</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[asPugKqKMUhH3837]{Claw Mark}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[nPuUsRMfAFe2l6Ll]{Upstairs, Downstairs}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[7yPxqLqUFRNauqHG]{Into The Sewers}</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>TUNING THE CHALLENGE</em></h3>\n<p><em>By the time your Characters have reached Middenheim, they will have been through a lot, with experience and skills to match.

It is not unknown for bawds and other rogues to be followers of Slaanesh, though in many cases they are employed by cult members for their useful skills and contacts, but not formally inducted. Some cultists regard such types as ‘not our kind of people’, while many bawds, in particular, are wary of being accused of cult affiliation.</p>\n<p>A junior cultist also has a @Roll[1d100]{25%} chance of a mutation.

{"_id":"TzRMvkOA1BuSJIum","name":"Scene 4 - The Investigation","permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"nIM7VxtzVOzcOrxh","sort":400001,"flags":{},"content":"<h2>Scene 4: The investigation</h2>\n<p>There are a few hooks that the PCs could investigate. One way or another, I expect their investigations will lead them to the docks, and then to the Black Eagle for @JournalEntry[vIvbA3n23gB3IoQk]{Scene 6} and the climax of the adventure. The shorter encounters in @JournalEntry[x0QhtZboWNFz4oAC]{Scene 5} can also be used to add a bit of local colour, and to slow down the pace of the investigation a little if needed. Ideally, the scenario should end with a fight, so that we can test out the combat rules, so I don&rsquo;t intend to make the investigation too difficult for the PCs.</p>\n<p>The docks have been hit by the recent economic slumps, and quite a lot of the area was very rundown to begin with. There&rsquo;ll be a lot of boarded up windows, a strong smell of piss and rotting fish and occasional seagulls fighting over a fish carcass. Examples of typical graffiti might include a crude painting of a fish devouring a man (a gang symbol of the Fish), a bloodied docker&rsquo;s hook (a gang symbol of the Hooks), or a sketch of Emperor Karl Franz with a penis in his mouth and the written slogan &ldquo;The Ratman Cometh&rdquo; scrawled underneath it.</p>\n<p>Typical dockland NPCs will include whores and their pimps, beggars, sailors, stevedores, discharged soldiers and apocalyptic preachers. There are probably also a fair few Hooks and Fish about, some of whom might take the PCs presence as a provocation, particularly if they linger here for too long. This could potentially be another way to end the session with a fight scene if the investigation isn&rsquo;t getting anywhere.</p>\n<h3>Investigating the silverware:</h3>\n<p>The stolen silverware will have been fenced with a pawnbroker. I&rsquo;m imagining a dilapidated and heavily shuttered shop in a shady part of town. They can either interrogate the owner or ransack the place to find the stolen silverware. Either way, some sort of test is probably required. The silver goblets have been melted down, but PCs who find the crucible filled with freshly melted silver will hopefully feel they have enough evidence to start asking more pointed questions.</p>\n<p>The pawnbroker&rsquo;s of Bretonnian heritage, and is known locally as &ldquo;Jacques the Hat&rdquo; because of the battered tricorn he wears to conceal his receding hairline. Jacques doesn&rsquo;t feel any particular loyalty to his clients. Jacques won&rsquo;t be willing to implicate himself (and would like to keep the silverware if at all possible) - but he will rat out the seller fairly quickly if the PCs start applying pressure. Assuming they&rsquo;ve found the silver, a <strong>Routine (+20) Intimidate </strong>Test will be enough to make him spill the beans: this becomes <strong>Easy (+40)</strong> if they rough him up a bit, or offer some sort of financial reward for his assistance. The PCs should really return the silver to the Ottingers, but if they&rsquo;re irredeemably corrupt then they could probably sell it on for about 2 GCs (subject to Haggle checks etc). Jacques will claim to have a receipt for the silver, but it&rsquo;s a fairly transparent fabrication &ndash; the receipt purports to show that he bought the silver from a ship captain (&ldquo;Jan Schmidt&rdquo;) who was travelling downriver from Marienburg.</p>\n<p>The silverware was brought in by a former soldier last night. (Jacques recognised that he was wearing an old army coat.) The pawnbroker will be able to supply a reasonable physical description (which probably includes some sort of tattoos or disfigurement to make him easier to trace, preferably whatever&rsquo;s consistent with the clues the PCs have already picked up on).</p>\n<p>Jacques&rsquo; responses are likely to be along the following lines: <em>&ldquo;What can I do for you, officers?&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing about that&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stolen goods? Officers, I&rsquo;m offended &ndash; they don&rsquo;t call me Honest Jacques for nothing!&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a receipt for that silver&rdquo; and &ldquo;Soldiers, you say? Look, now that I think about it, there was this soldier came calling by here last night &ndash; right shifty looking bugger he was, with gangland tattoos and a game leg. Wouldn&rsquo;t like to run into that one down a dark alley, let me tell you! I sent him packing, but I hear his gang are drinking at the Black Eagle &ndash; perhaps you can still catch them there if you hurry!&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Jacques has a crossbow under the counter to fend off robbers, but he won&rsquo;t risk pulling it on watchmen unless they seem intent on killing him (and even then he&rsquo;d rather flee).</p>\n<h3>Investigating the maid:</h3>\n<p>Investigating Ilse Grunberg might be a bit more difficult. The robbers paid her for the information she provided in advance of the heist, with money from their last job, and she&rsquo;s absconded. If the PCs are determined to investigate her, then they&rsquo;ll find her old landlady (known locally as the &ldquo;The Widow Hansen&rdquo; or &ldquo;Frau Hansen&rdquo;, although her given name is Gertrud). Frau Hansen&rsquo;s a lonely and slightly embittered old woman, who didn&rsquo;t particularly take to her pretty young lodger and is particularly aggrieved at the unpaid bills she left behind. Assuming the PCs are at least reasonably well behaved, Frau Hansen will be willing to invite them in for a cup of Mootland tea, and vent some of these frustrations (which will become increasingly venomous as the conversation goes on).</p>\n<p>Her home&rsquo;s clean and reasonably spacious, although poorly furnished, suggesting that she had money at one point but has come down in the world since. Similarly, her home is in what was once a very nice part of town, but many of the neighbouring buildings now bear gang graffiti and have boarded up windows. The PCs will notice a portrait of her late husband hanging above the mantelpiece. If asked, she will tell them that he was first mate of a merchant vessel.</p>\n<p>The following responses will give a flavour for her conversation: <em>&ldquo;How do you take your tea, officer?&rdquo; &ldquo;Fetch me down the green jar from the top shelf, would you, there&rsquo;s a dear&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;What a nice young man, your mother must be very proud&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Ilse Grunberg? Oh, yes, I remember that one &ndash; the little bitch skipped out without paying last month&rsquo;s rent&hellip; as if times weren&rsquo;t hard enough with that ridiculous window tax, and bread prices going up and up. Sigmar only know how we&rsquo;ll survive the winter&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Describe her? I suppose she was pretty enough in that empty-headed way young men seem to enjoy. Seemed very fond of soldiers &ndash; I warned her they weren&rsquo;t the marrying type, but the silly girl wouldn&rsquo;t listen&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Soldiers? Oh, yes &ndash; she had a whole gang of those ruffians sniffing around her skirts, they used to waste their evenings drinking and talking sedition at that grubby little dockland tavern, the Black Eagle. I hear a couple of them even fought over her &ndash; the rancid little tart must have loved that&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>If the PCs are so minded, it won&rsquo;t be too difficult to cultivate the Widow as a contact. She&rsquo;s lonely, and will be very happy to share the gossip she picks up with them on future adventures. If the PCs are indiscrete about where they&rsquo;re getting their information, this may result in the Hooks or Fish paying her a visit at some point, to teach her a lesson about the perils of talking to the Watch.</p>\n<h3>Investigating the robbers:</h3>\n<p>Investigating the robbers directly is unlikely to be productive, unless they already have strong leads. There are quite a few discharged soldiers in Altdorf now that the Storm of Chaos has ended, with widespread frustration at the unpaid wages still owed to those who served. Not all of them signed up willingly &ndash; many enlisted to avoid prison sentences.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the robbers are well on their way to becoming local heroes, and very few locals will want to be known to have ratted them out to the Watch.</p>\n<p>If the PCs keep digging, they&rsquo;ll learn that the ringleader of the gang in question&rsquo;s a bit of a celebrated local character. He ran with the Fish for a while, before being enlisted to fight in the War Against Chaos. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll run into one of his old comrades, who&rsquo;ll be able to tell them a bit about his service record, and his radical politics.</p>\n<h3>Investigating the law firm:</h3>\n<p>Vogel &amp; Stein are based in Altstadt. They&rsquo;re a well-established law firm, catering to the needs of their wealthy clients (and therefore tend to specialise in commercial and property law). Unless the PCs are very persuasive, they&rsquo;re not going to get anywhere by talking to the law firm directly. The lawyers will simply cite client confidentiality. They may not be willing to confirm that the minister&rsquo;s a client at all.</p>\n<p>Investigating the law firm more indirectly might reveal that they&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of business through intermediaries to buy up slum housing in the Old Docks on behalf of Obsidian Enterprises, and that some of the tenants have been evicted forcefully. These intermediaries are fairly rough characters, who are unlikely to much appreciate being investigated.</p>"}

The name is short for Miragliano Gasse, after one of its streets that does point vaguely in the direction of Tilea.

The joke among Reiklanders, however, is that on arrival in Altdorf, the Tilean immigrants here couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to travel any further. In truth, Tilean names are only a little more common here than any other part of the city. Even the landlord of the Eagle of Luccini is a Reiklander.</p>\n<p>The area is respectable enough, and used to be quite fashionable, but is becoming increasingly run-down. At its centre, Schmutzplatz is vibrant and prosperous, and by day swings to the sort of urban vibrancy typical of any busy area of the city. This quickly fades as the sun goes down, and law-abiding citizens disappear indoors. Away from the square, the narrow, twisting alleyways hide petty criminals and ruffians, especially at night.

However, descriptions of the Beast vary drastically over time. Is it a cat-like predator, perhaps escaped from the zoo? Is it a shambling tree monster, summoned by the Jade College?

{"_id":"UKE3qdwRlnAjuiP7","name":"Mystic Myrtle's Myriad Amusements","permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"WP8D3DgTaIPSKQ2L","sort":200000,"flags":{},"content":"<h2>Mystic Myrtle's Myriad Amusements</h2>\n<p>The Fair is in the plaza surrounding the statue of Wilhelm II</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is intended that the Characters visit the fair the evening before they get brought into the investigation. This provides clues to the forthcoming investigation, without them realising it, and once the investigation begins, the Characters should not really have the time or inclination to have fun. According to the adventure timeline, the Characters will visit the fair on Backertag after the crowds have died down a bit and some of the performers might be somewhat bored of Altdorf.</p>\n<p>The entire fair travels together, all in the employment of Mystic Myrtle. Unlike many fairs, which are a disparate bunch of travelling shows that converge on a city during an official festival or holiday, Mystic Myrtle&rsquo;s Myriad Amusements is a travelling company that show up hopefully at a settlement, largely on spec. The fair still proves popular enough with the locals, being packed and vibrant for the first few days of its stay, and progressively less busy as the week goes on.</p>\n<p>The fair is set out on common land outside the city with two rows of tents and wagons forming a sort of street. This street is populated by food vendors calling their wares. And each show has a caller, encouraging passers-by to enter. Music and the sounds of performances emanate from the tents and odd wagon, and so when it&rsquo;s busy the whole event becomes lively and boisterous. When not so busy, in the rain, it can feel empty and dismal.</p>\n<p>Each show is usually set out so that spectators get an enticing glimpse of what is going on inside each tent, but if they want a decent view they need to pay to enter. The Characters can be given free rein to check out all the shows and pay for whichever ones take their fancy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mystic Myrtle</li>\n<li>The Flying Galeshes, Acrobats and Contortionists</li>\n<li>The Mighty Klogg</li>\n<li>Espadrille the Fire Breather</li>\n<li>Pennie Loeffer, the Woman of a Thousand Faces</li>\n<li>Doktor B&uuml;te&rsquo;s Menagerie</li>\n<li>Br&ouml;gue the Puppetmaster</li>\n<li>Moe Kassin</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mystic Myrtle</h3>\n<p><em>&lsquo;Dare you know what fate has in store? Mystic Myrtle, world famous medium, will part the veil and take a glimpse for you.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p>Pride of place at the fair, at one end of the street, goes to Mystic Myrtle&rsquo;s purple and golden tent. Myrtle Muel is hugely madeup in the Bretonnian style and weighed down under layers of fabulous deep-purple fabrics.</p>\n<p>For three shillings she spends ten minutes telling someone&rsquo;s future. She has no real powers and employs the usual tricks to seem credible. However, you can take this opportunity to spoil some of the upcoming events of this adventure, in a vague way.</p>\n<p><em>&lsquo;Someone very soon will be relying on you to protect them.&rsquo; &lsquo;</em></p>\n<p><em> You are soon to hear the sound of tiny feet.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p><em>&lsquo;Not all is as it appears, especially in the darkest hours.&rsquo; </em></p>\n<p><em>&lsquo;</em><em>Know that just as the door to the other world can be opened with the mind, so too can the doors of this world.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p>Myrtle is actually a hard-nosed business woman and rules her caravan harshly. Everyone must pay her one tenth of their takings in order to travel with the fair. Br&ouml;gue has every intention of killing her off, sooner or later, but at the moment, he finds the cover of the fair very useful.</p>\n<h3>The Flying Galeshes, Acrobats and Contortionists</h3>\n<p><em>&lsquo;Come on in, ladies and gents. Ever so light on their feet, see these agile twin sisters twist and turn in death defyin&rsquo; gyrations of terrifyin&rsquo; tumblin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p>Geta and Jutti Galesh are acrobats and contortionists. Their act involves a trapeze and spinning around on ropes. They also do a bit of tumbling and tightrope walking. The pair are petite, athletic and very strong, with tiny feet. If there were a series of crimes committed recently which involve seemingly unreachable high places, then these two could well be considered suspects.</p>\n<h3>The Mighty Klogg</h3>\n<p><em>&lsquo;They say he&rsquo;s the strongest Halfling this side of the World&rsquo;s Edge Mountains. Test your strength against the mighty Klogg.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p>It costs 3 shillings to watch Klogg the Halfling impress with a variety of feats of strength. He bends iron bars around his head, he breaks stone slabs with his fist, and lifts massive barbells.</p>\n<p>Then for an extra 3 shillings all-comers can compete against him holding cannonballs upon their palms with their arms outstretched for as long as possible. Anyone who beats Klogg doubles their money. To compete in the contest each participant must make a <strong>Challenging Endurance Test</strong> to hold their cannonballs for a number of rounds equal to their SL. If the test is failed, the balls are immediately dropped and the contestant eliminated. Klogg&rsquo;s Endurance is 71. He has the Tenacious Talent so doubles the amount of time each success brings.</p>\n<h3>Espadrille the Fire Breather</h3>\n<p><em>&lsquo;Is it a dragon, is it a hydra, is it an organ gun? No, it&rsquo;s the great Espadrille; fire breather!&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p>For 5 shillings the people can watch in awe as Espadrille breathes fire from his mouth as if he were some exotic creature. This is probably the most spectacular and most unusual attraction in the fair, although Espadrille&rsquo;s act does get repetitive and the smell of sulphur a little noxious.</p>\n<p>Espadrille has no facial hair whatsoever, and affects an exaggerated Tilean accent, the sort of exoticism people might expect from a fire breather. But he is actually from Salzenmund and has a broad Nordlander accent, which has been identified on occasion when smoke gets in his eyes and he releases the odd expletive</p>\n<h3>Pennie Loeffer, the Woman of a Thousand Faces</h3>\n<p><em>&lsquo;Step right up, step right up, and see the woman of a thousand faces tell the history of the Empire.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p>It costs 3 shillings to see Pennie&rsquo;s act. She goes through an odd sort of history of the Empire, stepping behind her screen momentarily, to emerge as a character (well face only, and the occasional hat) relevant to the story, and then giving a quick in-character monologue. Of course, no one here knows what Sigmar, Verena, or Teclis actually looked like, so a lot of artistic licence is employed.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the caller&rsquo;s claims, Pennie is a woman of precisely 47 faces, but who&rsquo;s counting.</p>\n<h3>Doktor B&uuml;te&rsquo;s Menagerie</h3>\n<p><em>&lsquo;A magnificent menagerie of marvellous mammals and maleficent monsters!&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p>B&uuml;te has the biggest and smelliest tent in the row, and it is probably the fair&rsquo;s most popular exhibit. She is a broad, haughty figure who treats her animals with disdain, and is little better with people.</p>\n<p>It costs 5 shillings to come in and look around. Inside, in dim light, are eight iron cages, each occupied by a despondent creature. A big sign says, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Torment the Creatures.&rsquo; The animals are generally mundane, but exotic. There is a long, yellow-haired monkey from Lustria, a wide-eyed, long-fingered forest dwelling thing from the Southlands, a long-horned goat from the World&rsquo;s Edge Mountains, an eagle that has had its wings clipped, some sort of hog from the Badlands, a Baffin from across the Sea of Chaos, and an infant bear.</p>\n<h3>Br&ouml;gue the Puppetmaster</h3>\n<p><em>&lsquo;Watch in wonder as this dramatic story is told through the medium of marionettes.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p>It costs 3 shillings to watch this puppet show. It is a retelling of the traditional story of Orron and Erris who get lost in the woods. Instead of the more traditional ending this one ends with them being gruesomely murdered by three grotesque creatures. The puppetry, however, seems to be expertly done.</p>\n<p>Br&ouml;gue does the performance dressed all in black, with a black hood, fading into the black backcloth.</p>\n<h3>Moe Kassin</h3>\n<p>&lsquo;Get yer toffee apples &rsquo;ere. The sweetest apples you&rsquo;d ever d&rsquo;taste. Sweeter even than the apple of your eye.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Moe sells toffee apples (or whatever toffee-covered fruits are suitable for the season). She has a stove in one of the caravans where she heats up her sugary stuff and then dips the fruit in.</p>\n<p>She then sells them for 3d a go at the fair.</p>\n<p>For the past three months, however, someone has been interfering with her stock. Sometimes she loses entire toffee apples, sometimes just little bits, as if gnawed away by some sort of animal. She knows it must be someone in the fair because this has been going on for a long time, and from place to place.</p>\n<p>Moe has vowed to catch the culprit.</p>\n<p>In fact, Schn&auml;ker has developed a sweet tooth and he is responsible for the toffee apple crimes.</p>"}

But that era has passed, and only a handful of determined clans remain to defend their ancestral holds, with recently reclaimed Karak Azgaraz and towering Karak Ziﬂin being two of the largest still standing.</p>\n<p>The mountains and the tunnels beneath them are now overrun with Orcs and Goblins, Mountain Trolls, Skaven, and worse.

He has extensive black market connections, and trades secrets.</p>\n<p>Most rogues in Middenheim know about Alfric and can recommend him to anyone who is looking for information for sale. Alfric does not part with any information unless he gets something in return, which means he either wants gossip or money. Even letting Characters know that he does not know about something, or that the answer to their queries is merely ‘no’ costs [[/r 1d10]] Brass Pennies, and if they plump him for actual information this cost increases.</p>\n<p>Alfric trades information for information, but he does not accept idle gossip or obvious fabrications, it must be something that rings true and cannot be got just by listening to people in the street. If he realises he is being lied to he will happily sell his own lies back to the liar.  </p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Alfric uses the @JournalEntry[NUXlJY1IPwZJzDvO]{Bretonnian House Inn} in @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} as the base of his locations. It lies within the borders of the turf claimed by @JournalEntry[gy8z3RbyyEKaoJ2e]{Bleyden}, Lowest of the Low Kings. Bleyden offers Alfric a degree of protection, but is himself so besieged by his rivals that he cannot risk annoying the Dwarf by threatening him with censure, so Alfric is relatively free to let people know about criminal activity, for a price. The inn is fairly cheap and nasty, a stench of boiled cabbage clings to the place, but it is a marked step up from the Pit or the Drowned Rat. Alfric rarely leaves the inn (he sleeps in a small garret room on the upper floor).</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Alfric is resistant to Charm or Intimidate Tests, which suffer from a penalty of -1 SL. He does like bribes, so any Bribery Tests can be made with a +2 SL bonus (though they are something of a waste, Alfric can be bought in most circumstances and is quite open about it). Alfric does not let people Haggle him down, ever, he’d sooner starve.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Alfric knows a little bit about most of the controversies in Middenheim, however he has an understanding with the informer known as Josef (see @JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{The Taxes}), who sells high society secrets.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Like most Dwarfs in Middenheim Alfric reckons the influence of the Elves at court is behind the Dwarf Tax.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Alfric just wants to retain his position as a networker and seller of information. He does not like the Dwarf Tax, and supports its repeal, but he is too self-loathing to take it personally.</p>\n<h2>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</h2>\n<p>Alfric is all but unknown among the great and the good of Middenheim society, which suits the dwarf just fine, thank you. Those few who do know of him would never admit to it.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>In order not to step on Josef ’s toes Alfric will never volunteer information on individuals in high society. However, he can confirm suspicions for the price listed. Before Alfric sells anything about Middenheim’s courtly intrigues he suggests Josef as a source (and tells people how to find Josef for a charge of 6 schillings) but suggests that once they have spoken to Josef he might be able to add further juicy details, for a price.</p>\n<p>Josef reciprocates this relationship and suggests Alfric to the Characters if they are interested in information about Middenheim’s underworld.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsum} – Chancellor</strong>: Alfric knows that the chancellor is addicted to @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Laughing Powder}. He will confirm this for @Pay[4ss]{4 schillings}. He can also sell out @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl} as a local supplier, for @Pay[7ss]{7 schillings}. For @Pay[2ss]{2 schillings} he points out that he does not know who the go-between is, and that that is strange, as he knows most everyone who trades in such goods in the city. Alfric also knows about Josef ’s recent impertinence to Janna Erberhauer and Petra Liebkosen (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmeidehammer} – Champion</strong>: Alfric knows that Dieter’s behaviour changed recently and for @Pay[3ss]{3 schillings} he will agree that the symptoms look like those of a person who has been hypnotised. Alfric has met ‘Charlotte’. For a Gold Crown he admits that he has met her and provides a decent description highlighting her bright green eyes. He has not guessed that she is anyone’s alter ego. He does not say if they are due to meet again but a Character who passes a <strong>Very Hard (-30) Intuition </strong>Test might suspect that she and Alfric have met more than once.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Ralane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: Alfric is not particularly prejudiced against Elves but he has spent so much time around those who are that he believes Rallane to be behind the Dwarf Tax. This misleading opinion can be bought for @Pay[3ss]{3 schillings}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: Too hot to handle, tells anyone interested to talk to Josef.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: He does not sell information about her, but if he is asked if she is a relation of @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl}, and is paid @Pay[2ss]{2 schillings}, he says that it is not a lie.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: He can point out that Ulrich Schutzmann is a Sigmarite who regularly prays at the Temple of Sigmar in Middenheim for @Pay[6bp]{6 brass pennies}. <em>‘Hardly a secret but some might query his loyalty to Ulric’s holy city’</em>. He has nothing of interest to say about the other Midden Marshals.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Alfirc happens to know something<em> ‘a bit surprising about Janna Erberhauer’</em> but thinks Josef would prefer to sell it. Josef does not, so if Characters come back to Alfric he asks for @Pay[4ss]{4 schillings} and then relates that @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsum}, who is normally shy as a mouse with women, propositioned her rather rudely recently. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Tells anyone interested to talk to Josef.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: He leaves gossip about court to Josef, but can confirm Emmanuelle Schlagen’s status as paramour (@Pay[8ss]{8 schillings}) and the recent attempt by @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsum} to proposition Petra (@Pay[2ss]{2 schillings}). He can confirm gossip about @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulrc} and Emmanuelle, but only if the Charatcers spell it out, have already spoken to Josef about it, and pay @Pay[12ss]{12 schillings}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: Alfric knows little of Allavandrel but believes he helped @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} instigate the Dwarf Tax. This misleading opinion can be bought for @Pay[3ss]{3 schillings}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Alfric can relay that Gotthard is <em>‘a relatively recent arrival’ </em>(@Pay[2ss]{2 schillings}) who ‘earned his positions without a record of merit’ (@Pay[8ss]{8 schillings}).  </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: Alfric tells anyone interested to talk to Josef. Can suggest, if the subject of hypnosis is raised, that he knows an expert in the field who moves in court circles, and for @Pay[4ss]{4 schillings} he gives Luigi as a name. For another @Pay[3ss]{3 schillings} he explains that Luigi, for all his vices, does not mix with criminals. </p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Tells anyone interested to talk to Josef. He can confirm if asked that Erlich has been in depressed self-isolation recently (@Pay[3ss]{3 schillings}) and that Erlich’s support of the taxes is rather out of character (@Pay[5ss]{5 schillings}).</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Alfric is far too wrapped up in performative misanthropy to be seen enjoying himself, and eschews the carnival.</p>\n<h3>Handle With Care</h3>\n<p>There are a few things to consider when employing Alfric.</p>\n<p>Alfric plays a part in the fourth part of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong> campaign, <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. He should be used very sparingly in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, and whilst he might annoy the Characters, he should not anger them so much that they do away with him or ruin the chance to cooperate in future.</p>\n<p>Once every few weeks @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} disguises herself as ‘Charlotte’ and pays Alfric to inform her of any dealings within underworld society that might trouble her. She is next due to do this on the fifth day of Middenheim’s carnival. Unless the Characters adopt good disguises when speaking to Alfric he tells her what he knows of them. This may spur her to take action against them in turn.</p>","folder":"hQfHL1VS2zKPRt1T","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":400000}}}

{"_id":"VFDvYGHCjiFj38WX","name":"Attributes","content":"<h2>Attributes</h2>\n<p>Attributes describe your character&rsquo;s innate capabilities &ndash; how fast or strong you are, how much damage you can sustain, or how well you cope with stressful situations. Attributes include Movement, ten Characteristics, Wounds, Fate, and Resilience.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Wait! That's Not Fair!</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">You may notice that not all characters are created equal. An Elf has significant Characteristic advantages, for example. Don&rsquo;t be deceived by numbers alone, there are many aspects to character generation and all the Species have advantages and disadvantages at each stage, some of them not always obvious.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Characteristics</h3>\n<p>Your ten Characteristics are used in Tests, to determine if you perform an action successfully. The Human average for these Attributes is 30. Those who are gifted, or well-practiced, may achieve scores of over 40; only the most dedicated and experienced will achieve scores over 60. Of course, other Species have their own strengths and weaknesses, so their averages are different, sometimes significantly so.</p>\n<h4>Determining Characteristics</h4>\n<p>When determining your Characteristics:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1) </strong>Roll 2d10 for each of the ten Characteristics and make a note of the results. If you feel your Character would be improved if you swapped round some of the dice roll results between Characteristics, move to the next step. If you stick with your random results, add the die rolls to the modifier for each Characteristic from the Attribute Table, write them on your Character Sheet and gain +50 XP.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2) </strong>Rearrange the ten numbers rolled under step 1, assigning each to a different Characteristic (and adding its modifier). If you&rsquo;re happy with this new mix, record them on your Character Sheet and gain +25 XP. If not, move to the next step.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3) </strong>If you&rsquo;re still not happy with your results, either roll again and swap the rolls around with no XP bonus, or you could ignore the dice completely! Instead, allocate 100 points across the 10 Characteristics as you prefer, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 18 allocated to any single Characteristic. Add the modifiers from the Attribute Table and record them on your Character Sheet. Like rolling again, there is no XP bonus for this option.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Weapon Skill (WS)</h4>\n<p>Your skill at fighting hand-to-hand, your ability to land a measured blow, and effectiveness in the free-for-all of a massed melee. It is also used for unarmed combat, where your body is the weapon!</p>\n<h4>Ballistic Skill (BS)</h4>\n<p>Your effectiveness at hitting with ranged weapons like bows and throwing knives, and for throwing things generally. It is also used as the basis for other ranged attacks like Trolls vomiting.</p>\n<h4>Strength (S)</h4>\n<p>How much damage you do in melee, how much you can lift, and how good you are at things like swimming and climbing.</p>\n<h4>Toughness (T)</h4>\n<p>Your physical hardiness. It helps you survive damage in combat but will also help with things like surviving harsh conditions and standing up to poison.</p>\n<h4>Initiative (I)</h4>\n<p>Speed of thought and reaction, especially in the heat of battle and when under pressure. It determines combat order, and helps you be the first to react to danger. It also determines your powers of intuition and perception.</p>\n<h4>Agility (Ag)</h4>\n<p>Physical coordination and natural athleticism, and the basis for things like running, riding, and hiding. Agility is also used for dodging blows in combat.</p>\n<h4>Dexterity (Dex)</h4>\n<p>Your affinity for performing fine and delicate manual tasks like playing a musical instrument or skilled manufacturing. It will also help you with things like sleight of hand and picking pockets.</p>\n<h4>Intelligence (Int)</h4>\n<p>Your powers of thought, analysis, and understanding. Useful for healing, evaluating, and general knowledge, and vital for the understanding and casting of magical spells.</p>\n<h4>Willpower (WP)</h4>\n<p>General strength of mind, and your ability to shrug off difficulty and plough on with the job in hand. It helps with resisting all sorts of influence and coercion, and guards against fear and terror.</p>\n<p>Fellowship (Fel)</p>\n<p>Your ability to get on with people and come across as generally pleasant and acceptable. It will help you when chatting to locals or commanding people in battle, charming the guards or attempting to bribe them, and, for pious characters, communicating with your deity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Characteristic Bonuses</h4>\n<p>The first or &lsquo;tens&rsquo; digit of each Characteristic is its bonus value. Characteristic Bonuses are used in a variety of different ways throughout the rules, particularly for limiting Talents and defining Spells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Strength (S) 39 equates to a Strength Bonus of 3. Willpower (WP) of 51 equals a Willpower Bonus of 5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>WOUNDS (W)</h3>\n<p>Your Wounds show how much Damage you can endure based on your physical power and your force of will to shrug off injury. See&nbsp; Chapter 5: Rules for how Wounds are used to track Damage.</p>\n<h4>Determining Wounds</h4>\n<p>Unlike other Attributes, Wounds are derived from your Strength Bonus, twice your Toughness Bonus,, and Willpower Bonus (abbreviated to SB, TB, and WPB on the Attributes Table). Refer to the Attributes Table to determine the Characteristic Bonuses used to calculate your Wounds. Note: Halflings have the Small Talent automatically and start with fewer Wounds, (see page 341).</p>\n<h3>Fate &amp; Fortune, Resilience &amp; Resolve</h3>\n<p>Your Fate represents your destiny, and is directly tied to your Fortune, a measure of your luck. Your Resilience is your inner strength, which is directly related to your Resolve, defining your grit. Your Resilience also comes with a Motivation, which is a single word or phrase describing what drives your character forwards. See page 170 for more on all of these.</p>\n<h4>Determining Fate and Resilience</h4>\n<p>You start with a base value for Fate and Resilience, and then have a number of Extra Points to spread between these two Attributes as you see fit. The numbers for these are shown in the Attributes Table. The more points you allocate to Fate, the luckier you are. By comparison, a higher Resilience shows you can steel through any situation.</p>\n<h4>Determining Fortune and Resolve</h4>\n<p>Your initial Fortune is equal to your Fate. Your initial Resolve equals your Resilience. Mark all four values on your sheet.</p>\n<h4>Determining Motivation</h4>\n<p>All characters choose a Motivation. It represents your Character&rsquo;s core essence, a word or phrase that sums up what you live for. In addition to the obvious roleplaying benefits for portraying your character, Motivation is used to help you regain Resolve points. When considering your Motivation, think of something that is fundamental to your character&rsquo;s nature. Also try to make your Motivation something fun to roleplay, and something that will work well with the other PCs and their motivations.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Gustavus, a young Scholar at the University in Altdorf, has &lsquo;Thrillseeker&rsquo; for his Motivation. He lives his life in pursuit of excitement and danger, and Gustavus may regain Resolve points when he actively seeks out risky situations; perhaps he provokes antagonism in taverns, or deliberately breaks the law by stealing the feathers from the caps of State Soldiers.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Clotilda, a Reiksguard Knight, has &lsquo;Protect the weak&rsquo; as her Motivation. She is driven to stand up to bullies and braggarts, risking life and limb to save the Reikland&rsquo;s citizenry. Clotilda will regain her Resolve whenever she rescues others, or puts herself in harm&rsquo;s way to protect another.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong><em>: Ebba is a &lsquo;Rebellious&rsquo; apprentice wizard studying at the Light College. She loves to break the rules of the College, flaunting her master&rsquo;s authority, and poking her nose into books best left undisturbed. She regains Resolve whenever she breaks the rules set for her by superiors.</em></p>\n<p>Other examples of potential motivations include: a &lsquo;Perfectionist&rsquo;, who loves to plan meticulously and draws energy from flawless execution of schemes; a &lsquo;Nurturer&rsquo;, who gains strength from caring for others, or rescuing them from difficult situations; a &lsquo;Penitent Martyr&rsquo;, who revels in hardship to atone for past misdeeds; or a &lsquo;Shining Wit&rsquo;, who&rsquo;s ever engaging in witty badinage and banter to lighten the mood. If you can&rsquo;t think of a Motivation don&rsquo;t worry. One may arise as you create more of your character, and the other players and the GM can always help. Even if you do have one, it&rsquo;s possible you may change your mind later. @JournalEntry[Bringing Your Character To Life]{Step 8) Bringing Your Character To Life} is a good time to reconsider what your Motivation will be.</p>\n<h4>Movement (M)</h4>\n<p>Movement is used to determine your Walk and Run speed. Standard Human Movement is 4. If using a grid for movement this indicates how many squares you can move in a Round, or inches across the table top. Over the longer term it indicates how many miles per hour you can comfortably travel on foot. For more on Movement, see @JournalEntry[Moving During Combat]</p>\n<h3>Advance Characteristics</h3>\n<p>Upon selecting a career as \"Current\", you will see small \"plus\" symbols appear next to certain characteristics. You can allocate a total of 5 advances across these characteristics as you choose. Enter these advances in manually, as clicking the plus symbols to advance will spend experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Characteristic Advances</em></h3>\n<p><em>Characteristic Advances show training or experience in your Characteristics. The number of Advances you have in the Characteristic is added to the initial Characteristic to show your current ability. So, if you have an initial Dexterity of 25, and 5 Dexterity Advances, your Dexterity is now 30.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"Q0UfttGS2ZpKyqfG","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Character"}}}
{"_id":"VFeT21fUCaVMsmTB","name":"Magic Rules","content":"<h3>Second Sight</h3>\n<p>The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent allows you to perceive the Winds of Magic, and how magic influences the world around you. Second Sight affects all your senses, and how it manifests is dependent on individual experience and training: So, where Aqshy may have a hot, cinnamon odour to one pyromancer, it could feel like searing ear itches to another.</p>\n<p>If you have Second Sight, you may use any appropriate Skills with your aethyric senses, most commonly your Intuition, Perception, and Track Skills. For example, a wizard following the trail of a fleeing witch could make a Track test, following the faint traces of Dhar in the witch&rsquo;s path, rather than their literal footsteps. Or a Witch looking to see what kind of magic had gathered locally could use Perception to examine the Winds more closely. Like the mundane senses, Second Sight does not simply switch off, which is a source of great discomfort to those who would rather have no truck with the Winds of Magic but cannot help what they perceive. This means the GM may request Tests, or take Tests on your behalf, to see if you spot subtle magical details in your surrounding environment, even if you&rsquo;re not looking for them.</p>\n<p>Spells</p>\n<p>There are four types of spell: Petty, Arcane, Lore, and Chaos spells. Petty spells are simple tricks that use negligible amounts of magic. Arcane Spells are generic spells open to those studying any Lore of Magic or Chaos Magic. Lore spells are those you can only learn if you know that Lore; i.e. to learn spells from the Lore of Fire, you need the Arcane Magic (Fire) Talent. Chaos spells are those practiced by those who&rsquo;ve lost their souls to Chaos.</p>\n<h4>Memorising Spells</h4>\n<p>Holding the complex linguistic structures of Language (Magick) in mind is a challenging task, so simply transcribing a spell into your grimoire does not allow you learn a spell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To memorise a spell &mdash; and therefore be able to cast it without access to your grimoire &mdash; you typically need to spend the amount of XP noted in your spellcasting Talent. Once a spell has been memorised, a spellcaster knows it permanently, barring special circumstances.</p>\n<h3>Casting Test</h3>\n<p>To cast a spell, make a <strong>Language (Magick) </strong>Test. If you succeed, match your SL to the Casting Number (CN) of the spell (listed in the individual spell description). If your SL is equal to or higher than the CN of the spell, it is cast as explained in the spell&rsquo;s description. If failed, the spell attempt fails, and nothing else happens.</p>\n<h4>Critical Casting</h4>\n<p>If the casting roll is a Critical, the Winds of Magic have flared dangerously high, granting you extra power, but at a cost. Unless you have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.BYChSVfMG004eflQ]{Instinctive Diction} Talent, you roll on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table} as the power moves beyond your control, but you may also choose one of the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Critical Cast</strong>: If the spell causes Damage, it also inflicts a Critical Wound.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Power</strong>: The spell is cast, no matter its CN and your rolled SL, but can be Dispelled.</li>\n<li><strong>Unstoppable Force</strong>: If you scored enough SL to cast your spell, it cannot be Dispelled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Fumbled Casting</h4>\n<p>If you lose control of the magical energy you are channelling, things invariably go awry. If you Fumble your Casting Test, you suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table}.<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Malignant Influence</em></h3>\n<p><em>Casting close to sources of Corruption makes controlling the Winds of Magic much more difficult. When attempting a Language (Magick) or Channelling Test in the vicinity of a @JournalEntry[Corruption]{Corrupting Influence}, any roll of an 8 (representing the eight-pointed symbol of Chaos) on the units die results in a @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast} as the Magic goes wild. If you already have a Minor Miscast on the Test for another reason, the Miscast escalates to a @Table[majormis]{Major Miscast}.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong>This is available through a checkbox in the roll dialog</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Duration</h4>\n<p>If a spell is successfully cast, it remains in effect for its Duration unless it is dispelled. You may not simply end your spells already in play, but you may attempt to Dispel them.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Grimoires</h4>\n<p>Some spellcasters own a spellbook, or grimoire, in which they transcribe their spells. Apprentices copy spells from their master, while experienced wizards will actively seek out new spells from other wizards, often trading spells for favours. A spellcaster may cast a spell directly from a grimoire if the spell belongs to a Lore they possess. Doing so doubles the Casting Number.</p>\n<h4>Magic Missiles</h4>\n<p>Some spells are marked as magic missiles ; these are damage-causing spells that all follow the same rules. When a magic missile is successfully cast and targets another character, the Hit Location struck is determined by reversing the dice rolled on the Language (Magick) Test and referring to the Hit Location Table (see page 159). The SL of the Language (Magick) Test is added to the spell&rsquo;s listed Damage and your Willpower Bonus to determine the total inflicted Damage. This Damage is reduced by the target&rsquo;s Toughness and Armour Points as normal.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Touch Spells in Combat</h4>\n<p>Certain spells require you to touch the target. If in combat, or if the target is unwilling to be touched, you must make an <strong>Opposed Melee (Brawling) </strong>Test (generally opposed by the Melee or Dodge Skill) after completing the Casting Test. If you do this and your spell was a magic missile , the Melee (Brawling) Test is used to determine Hit Location struck, not the Language (Magick) Test.</p>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<p>Spellcasters may channel their magic through an appropriate ingredient before unleashing their spells. Doing this offers protection against Miscasts as the attuned ingredient absorbs the worst of any magical backlash.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you use an ingredient when casting, any suffered Major Miscast becomes a Minor Miscast, and any Minor Miscast has no effect. If used in this way, the ingredient is consumed or destroyed by the process, even if no Miscast was rolled.</p>\n<p>Ingredients cost the CN in silver shillings for Arcane and Lore spells. Whenever you purchase a new ingredient, mark on your character sheet which spell it supports; ingredients only work for specific spells, not for all spells in your Lore. For those looking to add character to their ingredients, sample ingredients for each of the primary Lores of Magic are provided by the individual spell lists.</p>\n<h4>Limitations</h4>\n<p>As spells are spoken, you must be able to speak &mdash; not gagged, strangled, or underwater &mdash; to cast. If your voice is inhibited, the Difficulty of your Language (Magick) Test to cast a spell should be increased by the GM. Further, the Language of Magick needs to be spoken (or sung, for those using the Lore of Light) clearly, and often loudly, to ensure spells work; magic is anything but subtle. As a loose guide, the higher the CN of a spell, the louder the spell is chanted.</p>\n<p>Each of your spells can only be in effect once, meaning you have to wait for a cast spell to come to an end, or be dispelled, before using the same spell again. Further, spells providing bonuses or penalties do not stack. Instead, the best bonus and worst penalty is applied from every spell cast upon you. So, if you had a spell providing a bonus of +20 Willpower, and another providing +10 Willpower, you gain a bonus of +20 Willpower, not +30.</p>\n<p>Lastly, unless otherwise specified, you always need to be able to see &mdash; i.e. have Line of Sight &mdash; to your target.</p>\n<h3>Channelling Test</h3>\n<p>Some magical spells require far more magic than can normally be found ambiently flowing through the world. To power such spells, it is possible to draw the Winds of Magic and concentrate them into a more powerful form by using the Channelling Skill. Channelling the Winds of Magic can be a dangerous procedure, but it is the only sure way to cast some powerful spells. To channel magic for a spell, make an Extended Channelling Test.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When your SL reaches the CN of your selected spell, you have channelled enough magic to cast it. On the next Round, you can cast your spell using the normal Casting rules, but count the chosen spell&rsquo;s Casting Number as 0. If the casting Test fails, you also lose all your channelled magical energy, and suffer a Minor Miscast as it all writhes free from your Aethyric grasp.</p>\n<h4>Critical Channelling</h4>\n<p>If you roll a Critical when Channelling, you have channelled a mighty flow of magic and can cast your spell next Round regardless of the SL you&rsquo;ve scored in the Extended Test so far; however, so much magic so quickly concentrated in one place results in some magical backlash: roll 1d100 on the Minor Miscast Table unless you have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.1IZWRr7BYOIcqPlQ]{Aethyric Attunement} Talent.</p>\n<h4>Fumble</h4>\n<p>Channelling the Winds of Magic in a large flow is dangerous. You count any double or any roll ending in a 0 over your Skill as a Fumble, so, 00, 99, 90, 88, and so on. If you fumble a Channelling Test, you suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the Major Miscast Table.</p>\n<h4>Interruptions</h4>\n<p>Concentration is vital when channelling. If you are distracted by anything &mdash; loud noises, suffering damage, flashing lights, or similar &mdash; you must pass a <strong>Hard (&ndash;20) Cool </strong>Test, or suffer a @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast} and lose all SL you have accrued in the Extended Channelling Test so far.</p>\n<h3>Repelling the Winds</h3>\n<p>Wearing colours appropriate to the Wind of Magic you are manipulating helps attract the magic to you. This is the reason most wizards choose to dress in the traditional garb of their order.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All Casting and Channelling Tests suffer a &ndash;1 SL penalty if you are dressed inappropriately for the Wind of Magic you are trying to attract, as determined by the GM. Specifically, metal and leather armour repel most of the Winds: metal is laden with the golden wind Chamon , while leather retains traces of the amber Ghur . As such, spellcasters wearing armour suffer &ndash;1 SL penalty to all Casting and Channelling Tests for every Armour Point on the location with the most armour. Casters with the <em>Arcane Magic (Metal) </em>Talent may wear metal armour without penalty; those with <em>Arcane Magic (Beasts)</em> Talent may ignore penalties from leather armour.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Dispelling</h3>\n<p>If a spell targets you, or a point you can see within Willpower yards, you may oppose the Casting Test with Language (Magick) as you chant a counterspell. Make an Opposed Language (Magick) Test. If you win the Opposed Test, you dispel the incoming spell; if you lose, the spell uses the SL of the Opposed Test to determine whether the casting was successful as normal. You may only attempt to dispel a single spell every Round.</p>\n<h4>Dispelling Persistent Spells</h4>\n<p>If a spell has a lasting effect, you may attempt to dispel that spell for your Action. This is done by making an <strong>Extended Language (Magick)</strong> Test. When your SL reaches the CN of the ongoing spell, you successfully dispel it.</p>\n<p>Multiple spellcasters attempting to dispel the same spell each roll separately. If they cast using the same Lore, they may decide to make an Assisted Test instead.</p>\n<h3>Using Warpstone</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Officially the use of warpstone is precluded by the powers that be. Unofficially, I can say that it is officially never used within this college. Officially, I cannot say what unofficial uses it might have.

Not such an unusual event in these squalid areas, but Clemons Siberg was a respectable member of the community, a loving family man and loyal employee. Or perhaps not, as the case may be. Siberg was having a long term relationship with a @JournalEntry[Wu5dEX0wwpn6TDaJ]{prostitute from the Street of a Hundred Taverns}, the latest in a long line of affairs. Additionally, to finance this double-life, he has been selling information about his company to Its rivals.</p>\n<p>His brother-in-law Mikhail Pallenburg, who has always hated him, learned of Clemons&rsquo; mistress and when confronted, Clemons revealed that he intended to move in with the girl. Appalled at the disgrace this would bring upon his sister, Pallenburg followed Clemons until they were alone. After unsuccessfully trying to convince him to change his mind Mikhail killed him in cold blood.</p>\n<p>To complicate matters Clemons was carrying a set of records which he intended to sell to the blackmailer, &lsquo;Spices&rsquo; Bob. However, these were stolen from the body by a local thief, who has no idea what he has.</p>\n<h3>What happened that Fateful Night</h3>\n<p>Investigating the murder will centre around the details of Siberg&rsquo;s last night alive. The PCs will find all these out slowly, but they are presented below as a summary for the GM. The times are approximate, the exact times unknown to the characters, who will say &lsquo;early evening&rsquo;, dusk, just before dinner etc..</p>\n<p><strong>6:00</strong> Siberg leaves work.</p>\n<p><strong>6:30</strong> Arrives home and argues with Pallenburg, changes clothes and leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>7:00</strong> Has dinner at&nbsp;Bistro de Bianchi.</p>\n<p><strong>7:45</strong> He and Alexander Lommel get a carriage to the @JournalEntry[bb5O0d6JocujJdU4]{Sullen Knight}, where they meet Ingrid and Elisabeth. After a drink they leave as couples.</p>\n<p><strong>10:30</strong> Siberg returns to the Sullen Knight&nbsp;and meets &lsquo;Spices&rsquo; Bob, the blackmailer, whom he is to pay off. He tries to use the stolen records instead. They argue and Siberg is thrown out.</p>\n<p><strong>10:45</strong> Pallenburg and Siberg fight. Siberg drops his pistol after firing it.</p>\n<p><strong>11:00</strong> Siberg returns to @JournalEntry[Wu5dEX0wwpn6TDaJ]{Ingrid&rsquo;s house} where she bandages his wounds, before he leaves again.</p>\n<p><strong>11:30</strong> Pallenburg kills Siberg with Siberg&rsquo;s pistol and then batters him to death with his walking stick.</p>\n<p><strong>5:00 a.m.</strong> @JournalEntry[HMHG0ElZFJH400c8]{Erik Witzelheim} wakes up to find the body and takes the book.</p>\n<h3>Clemons Siberg</h3>\n<p>So who was Clemons Siberg, and why was he killed? Outwardly, he was a respected member of the community and a valued employee. Friends will say that he loved his wife and son and could always be counted on for help. Of course, the reality was somewhat different.</p>\n<p>He was born on a farm in Hochland, but its environs could do little to entertain his intellect and desires, and with ambition as his guide, he journeyed to Altdorf. Throughout his life he remained a deeply superstitious person, a trait that kept him from the charms of Chaos. He learned to read and conduct himself with class, and in time impressed the young Edith Pallenburg. Edith, the youngest daughter of a minor noble who had made his fortune as a Merchant, was flattered by this handsome young man&rsquo;s attentions.</p>\n<p>Becoming friends with her father as he wooed Edith, it wasn&rsquo;t long before they were married. Days later, her brother Mikhail returned home and was horrified to find his sister married to someone beneath her. Although deeply distraught, Mikhail kept his silence. As the years passed, Clemons started to distance himself from his wife, indulging his taste for wine and women. Meanwhile, he was rising in the company, believing it would soon be his. That was until Mikhail sold it after his fathers death. Stuck in the same position for years, Clemons still continued his double-life.</p>\n<p>With money running short he Started to sell company records to the Reik and Talabec Trading Company. These have been used to drive the company close to bankruptcy. Recently, he fell for a prostitute in the Docklands area and pays her to live as his mistress. Tired of his lifelong deceptions Clemons began to flaunt her openly. This enraged Mikhail, who eventually confronted and killed him.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}
{"_id":"VRFxm5Aif3ZrRcZe","name":"Advantage (GM's Guide)","content":"<h3>Advantage In Large Combats</h3>\n<p>The Advantage system works well when there are only a handful of combatants, but it quickly becomes unmanageable when there are ten or more Characters and Creatures all fighting together. In such situations, here are two approaches that work well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert multiple Creatures into a Swarm. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.E2Es82TvBKa7CoDG]{Swarm} rules are purposefully vague enough that they can be applied to any group of combatants, whether they are actually swarming creatures like rats, or just a rabble of peasants. Two Swarms of Clanrats backed up by a single Rat Ogre is a much more manageable encounter than managing 20 Clanrats individually.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Use Group Advantage. When there are multiple combatants working together as a group, you may abstract their Advantage into one single pool of Advantage that they all use. When you do this, generate Advantage as normal, but with a limit of Initiative Bonus gained per Round of combat, regardless of the source. Additionally, whenever a member of the group would lose all of their Advantage, the group loses 2 instead, keeping the remainder.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: The Characters are fighting six Goblins, and the GM decides to use Group Advantage. The Goblins have an Initiative Bonus of 2, so can generate a maximum of 2 Advantage as a group per Round. On the first Round, three of the Goblins charge the Characters. Normally, each would generate 1 Advantage, but instead, they generate 3 Advantage for the group, which drops down to 2 given their Initiative Bonus. Any additional Advantage gained this Round by any of the Goblins won’t be counted, but now they all benefit from a +20 to all relevant Tests. On the following Round, after gaining +2 more Advantage as a group, one of the Goblins is defeated in an Opposed Melee Test. Normally that Goblin would lose all of their Advantage, but because they are in a group, the group merely loses 2 Advantage, and retains the rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Removing Advantage</h3>\n<p>Whilst it’s great when you have Advantage on your side, the tables can turn very quickly in WFRP, and before you know it, your opponents have built up deadly momentum. When overwhelming Advantage is accrued, it can seem impossible to overcome it. Here are three broad tips for removing Advantage.</p>\n<h4>Ranged Combatants</h4>\n<p>Ranged attacks cannot be Opposed unless performed at Point Blank Range or the target wields a shield, which means that no amount of Advantage will help a Character avoid losing Wounds! Make sure to place a few Creatures with ranged attacks in Combat scenes, and have them target the Characters who are building momentum the most. However, keep in mind that because ranged attacks aren’t Opposed, successfully hitting an opponent with a ranged attack doesn’t generate Advantage.</p>\n<h4>Passive Damage</h4>\n<p>Passive Damage is any source of Wound loss that isn’t defended against, such as from the Ablaze, Bleeding, or Poisoned Conditions. Whilst some of these Conditions would involve Tests where Advantage would be relevant (such as dodging a thrown Incendiary, or parrying a poisoned blade) there are other ways to inflict these Conditions: employ the terrain, use Long Range, or target a Character’s non-combat Skills, such as Endurance.</p>\n<h4>Retreat</h4>\n<p>Remember that a combatant loses 1 Advantage per Round if they failed to accrue any extra Advantage during that Round, or they end the Round outnumbered. Which means, if things are going badly for a combatant, they should try to put distance between themselves and their potential killer. Fleeing is one option, but it’s not the only one. Consider the location where the Combat is taking place, and see if there are any ways to create barriers between combatants — throwing tables and chairs in the way, setting the ground on fire, and cutting the ropes suspending a bridge, are just a few examples.</p>\n<p>With a bit of creativity, and by thinking about the Scene where the Combat takes place, you and your Players can use Advantage as an inspiring feature of the system, rather than a snowballing problem to overcome. Remember that, whilst the Characters in the story wouldn’t call it Advantage, they would be aware of momentum in a fight, and would try to be creative on the battlefield themselves to mitigate bad odds.</p>\n<h3>Creatures Without the Weapon Trait</h3>\n<p>Some Creatures such as the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.FmEDHnfAe2iIugpt]{Bog Octopus} in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay or the <em>Young Stirpike</em> in <strong>Ubersreik Adventures: If Looks Could Kill</strong> lack a Weapon Creature Trait, but have in its place the Bite, Tail, Tentacles, Vomit, and other such Traits that use Advantage as a cost. These Traits, without the Weapon Trait, mean that the Creature can’t perform normal attacks, and must use their special attacks if they want to defeat an opponent. </p>\n<p>This is entirely intentional, and allows these Creatures to be played in truly unorthodox ways, which encourages more dynamic Combat. You should consider the full range of methods for gaining @JournalEntry[sAFW2R7LeDYN5Z5F]{Advantage} to aid in these situations. Charging, for example, is a good tactic to use when immediately followed by a Bite.

{"_id":"Vc09tZNuKQcfD7QP","name":"The Court Climax","content":"<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} plot reaches its devastating conclusion late on the last night of the Carnival. As the crowds drink and cheer at the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}, the evil Law Lord sits back in his apartments at the Inner Palace, waiting for the summons from @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris}. The summons  informs him all has been successful, and that for the Cult of the Purple Hand, the Time of Changes has arrived.</p>\n<h3>Wasmeier’s Plan</h3>\n<p>In the Law Lord’s warped but brilliant mind, the events of Festag night are planned as follows.</p>\n<p>At about 9.00 p.m., @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} visits @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor Sparsam} with his next batch of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald's Delight}. She then returns to the lair to oversee the final leaving preparations: it is important that the lair be made to look like it has been vacated in a hurry. Klaglich’s last act is to hand Reya over to a member of the Ordo Novitiae. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} and the @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Hoflich} Doppelgänger are enjoying the opera @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{<em>The Ring of the Nibble Unger</em>} Lied at the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music}. The performance is set to end at midnight, and by 12.30am the two men have returned to the Palace.</p>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} makes his way to his room, but @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Hoflich} goes to the Graf ’s chambers, and seeks an immediate audience. Despite the time, the Graf ’s personal guard would not think of denying entrance to one of the three Law Lords — especially Hoflich with his fearsome reputation. The Graf is, of course, alone, and his death is simple.</p>\n<p>At this stage, the creature will not assume the Graf ’s form. It opens a window and leaves — still as Hoflich — instructing the guards that the Graf does not wish to be disturbed for the next hour.</p>\n<p>Back in his apartment, the Hoflich Doppelgänger consumes a <em>Potion of Invisibility</em> supplied by Wasmeier and re-enters the Graf ’s rooms via the open window, using a rope and grapnel. @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{The Illuminations} distract the Outer Palace Guards’ attention.</p>\n<p>The Doppelgänger then take the Graf ’s form and, after the invisibility has worn off (which may take up to an hour), instructs the guards to fetch @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Law Lord Wasmeier}. The two celebrate their success, and watch the remainder of the fireworks from the south window. Wasmeier then pays a visit to Hoflich’s apartment before going home: this visit is just for show, to indicate that Hoflich is still in the Palace.</p>\n<p>Next morning, the Graf will surprise everyone by calling for a meeting of his advisors; all will attend apart from Hoflich. Not bothering to wait, the Graf will demand to know who was behind the taxes. @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} will expect many of the advisors to remain quiet, but he will speak out and name Hoflich.</p>\n<p>A second call will go out for the Law Lord, and when he cannot be found his Palace rooms are searched. The mouldering body of the real Law Lord is found, along with some incriminating evidence: the diagram of influence and the address of the pawns’ lair. There, evidence of Reya’s imprisonment and @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric’s} letters are found, and a ghastly plot may be deduced.</p>\n<p>From the way both Hoflich’s apartment and the lair have been left, it looks like the criminals vacated in a hurry. @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Law Lord Wasmeier} publicly blames himself for this: after his conversation with Graf Boris, he informed Hoflich that the Graf was against the taxes, and meant to repeal them.</p>\n<h3>Festag Night</h3>\n<p>Though they may not know it, the Characters are on a collision course with @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} plan.</p>\n<p>Despite their best efforts, even a very good party is unable to gain the open support of @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}, @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{the paramour}, or @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich} before Festag night. More importantly, the vital clue known only to Ehrlich — that it was @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Hoflich} who introduced the taxes and who threatened him — will not be revealed until the Law Lord’s niece is safe.</p>\n<p>So, while the Characters may have correctly deduced the various holds that the unknown villain has over each of the NPCs, they will only be able to do something about it on Festag night: either when they trail @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} to her lair, or intercept the delivery of letters and Reya Ehrlich. Both these events are timed to occur at about 11:30pm — about an hour before the @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppelgänger} is due to murder the Graf, which should be more than enough time to stop the plot.</p>\n<h4>A Clash with the Pawns</h4>\n<p>The first thing the Characters must do is deal with the pawns. If they hesitate, have some of them (but not Klaglich) leave the lair: the Characters will be forced to react to prevent them escaping. @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} can join the combat a few rounds later or, if the party splits up, have her in the lair trying to batter down the door to Reya’s prison cell: the mercenary Dagmar suspects that Reya  might be harmed rather than ransomed, and is attempting to prevent it.</p>\n<p>Optionally, one of the NPCs may escape. Then, the party must act before the NPC can get a warning to ‘The Boss'. They aren’t to know that the escaped NPC has no idea who ‘The Boss’ is.</p>\n<p>Having dealt with the pawns, the party should discover the love-letters and Reya; they will probably wish to visit one of the major NPCs involved. lf they wish to visit @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} first, Reya will demand to be taken to her uncle at once! Ar-Ulric is not attending any event and will be difficult to locate in any case.</p>\n<p>Nearly the whole of Middenheim will be out on the streets by now, as people make their way to the @JournalEntry[UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{Great Park} for the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Grand Finale} of fireworks and magic. Every minute counts as the Characters try and wade through the crowds. Eventually, the party arrives at @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich’s} house. He takes a minute or so to come to the door: more time wasted. At the sight of his niece, he bursts into tears of joy. </p>\n<p>‘Shallya and Sigmar be thanked!’ he cries; hugging Reya to him. He wipes away his tears with one hand, and still hugging his niece, he addresses the Characters. ‘It was Hoflich! He kidnapped Reya to force me to support his taxes! My friends, there is no time to lose! Watch, ho! Quickly!’</p>\n<h4>The Game is Afoot!</h4>\n<p>With his niece safe, @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich} is a different man. Calling the Watch to escort them all, he sets out with Reya and the Characters to confront Hoflich, and put the whole matter before the Graf.</p>\n<p>What happens next depends on whether the Characters have arrived at Ehrlich’s house before or after midnight. lf it is already past midnight, Ehrlich leads the party straight to @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{the Palace}; if not, he heads for the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music}, pointing out that Hoflich is an opera buff, and tonight is the last night of @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{<em>The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied</em>}. ‘If we hurry, we can take him before he knows that his plan has misfired! Come on!’</p>\n<p>Play the rush across the city to the full, consulting the city map. The players should feel the pressure of time mounting against them. Time each section of the journey, ask the players which route they are taking, and roll dice frequently. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘OK, you start off here, and the Royal College of Music is here (indicating map). Now, you could head down Fursten Allee and round the north side of the Great Park, or you could… that way? Right. To get from one end of Fursten Allee to the other should take you about three minutes (writes down ‘3,’ rolls dice, leafs through book). OK, it’s not too crowded, and people get out of the way as the Watchmen shout at them to do so (rolls dice and consults book again). Hmmm — it’s pretty crowded around the Park (rolls dice again). Looks like it will take you about six minutes just to get across the Garten Ring to the Ost Weg. Of course, you could head up Panther’s Parade and along Palast Strasse: it’s a longer route, but it might be less crowded…’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All this has no effect on the course of events, but it gives the players the feeling that they are racing against time building up the tension to the climax of the adventure.</p>\n<h4>The Royal College of Music</h4>\n<p>The party arrives at the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music} just as everyone is leaving. After a few minutes asking around, they discover that @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Law Lord Hoflich} has already set off to @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{the Palace} in a coach. They must now hurry back to the Palace, with more time wasted.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[16KsfNTgXYLtRib9]{The Middenpalaz}</h4>\n<p>Arriving at the Palace, the party learns that Hoflich arrived about 12.30 a.m. With Ehrlich’s authority, they are allowed access to the Inner Palace grounds. When they arrive at the Inner Palace proper, they learn that Hoflich went to see the Graf just a few minutes previously. If the party is running late, assume that Hoflich spent some time in his apartment after coming back from the opera.</p>\n<p>The Characters should begin to develop a very bad feeling. @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich} summons the duty officer of the Knights Panther, and explains that treachery is afoot.</p>\n<p>‘Law Lord Hoflich is a traitor!’ he cries. ‘Guard my niece here with your lives, and summon all the Graf ’s advisors immediately! And at all costs, make sure that Hoflich does not leave the Palace!’</p>\n<p>With that, he leads the party upstairs to the Graf ’s chambers, outside which they meet his personal guard of ten Knights Panther.</p>\n<p>‘Treachery!’ cries Ehrlich. ‘Hoflich is a traitor! I must speak to the Graf immediately!’ While the Knights are still thinking about this, he throws open the doors to the Graf ’s chambers, and stops in his tracks, his expression one of dumbfounded, slack-jawed amazement. In the middle of the room, two identical Grafs are locked in combat, one strangling the other from behind with a length of cord! Every character must make a successful <strong>Difficult (–10) Willpower</strong> Test or gain the @Condition[Surprised]{Surprised} condition.</p>\n<p>The real Graf is the one currently having the life squeezed out of him, and is only two rounds away from death.</p>\n<p>This is not a new situation for the Doppelgänger. It has been discovered during murder attempts in the past — its aim now will be to escape. It will release the pressure on its garrote, but keep a hold on the Graf, using him as a human shield. In his feeble, choked state the Graf is in no position to resist.</p>\n<p>The creature backs off towards the nearest southern room, threatening to finish off the Graf should anyone make a move. It opens the door with one hand, and then pushes the Graf forward and darts into the room, closing and bolting the door before anyone can reach it.</p>\n<p>If anyone makes a threatening move (including seeming to cast a spell), the Doppelgänger tightens the garrote, knowing that it has nothing to lose. In this case, only two rounds pass before the Graf of Middenheim collapses, apparently dead!</p>\n<p>In either case, the Characters are faced with a Graf who is close to death, and an identical imposter who is attempting to escape. Despite their enthusiasm for capturing the fake Graf, the Characters — or at least some of them — should attend to the real Graf Boris at once. Remember, he is not some peasant whose life is meaningless: he is an Imperial Elector with more money and influence than any Character could possibly imagine. </p>\n<p>Optionally, a successful use of any healing Spell or Skill by any Character or NPC will revive even a seemingly dead Graf.</p>\n<p>The Doppelgänger has a round in which to lock or bolt the door, and while it is being battered down (T 4, D 10), the creature makes its escape by jumping from a window into the gardens (5 yd).</p>\n<p>In the darkness, the @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppelgänger} returns to Hoflich’s form (aware that a Graf dressed in nightclothes will attract too much attention) and tries to leave the Palace, bluffing its way out if needed. Remember, at this stage it is only the Palace building guards who have been commanded to stop Hoflich: the gate guards have no such orders, and it is able to get through the gates in Hoflich’s form.</p>\n<p>If the creature is being chased and attacked by Characters, the guards will naturally side with the ‘Law Lord,’ until the Graf ’s personal guards — who saw the Doppelgänger — arrive to issue other instructions. Should the Doppelgänger be killed, it immediately returns to its true physical form.</p>\n<p>Things could be very confusing for a while, as different Palace guards side with various NPCs and Characters. Since the two Law Lords effectively cancel each other out, the deciding factor is the intervention of the Graf ’s personal guards. These are Knights Panther and are not (generally) stupid; they will realise that the fake Graf must have been whatever creature entered the room in the guise of Law Lord Hoflich.</p>\n<h4>After the Attack</h4>\n<p>Eventually the @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppelgänger} is either killed or captured, or it escapes into the vast Carnival crowds. Attention should then return to the Graf ’s chambers, where there is much activity. The rest of the Palace is stirring, too. Dozens of Knights Panther take up station all over the Inner Palace, with Graf Boris and his family being heavily guarded. The Palace grounds are extensively searched, and units dispatched to locate and fetch all high-level advisors — especially @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Baronial Physician Pavarotti}.</p>\n<p>During this time, the Characters are guarded until the Midden Marshals arrive and interview them; they are not allowed to go wandering around the Palace, and are certainly not allowed to leave. In part, this is for their own protection: without escort, the Characters are likely to be challenged by any group of guards they come across.</p>\n<p>The Marshals will demand a full explanation of events from the Knights and the Characters. Only then, provided they are satisfied by the Characters’ involvement, will they be treated as heroes rather than villains. By this time, all the major NPCs (bar @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}) will be in the Palace, and most will be confused.</p>\n<p>Given that the Characters can claim to have saved the Graf ’s life, this reaction may prove a little galling. However, orders are orders, and during periods of military crisis it is the senior officer on the scene that has full command. @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich} will vouch for the party, but his word does not count for everything. However, any information given by Ehrlich and the Characters will be thoroughly investigated.</p>\n<h4>A Grisly Discovery</h4>\n<p>When the Marshals have finished talking to the Characters, a Knight appears and talks quietly with @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Commander Schutzmann}. Schutzmann listens, nods, then turns to the party, saying ‘Come with me.’ They are led to Hoflich’s apartment, which shows signs of a thorough search.</p>\n<p>A trunk has been dragged into the middle of the room, and opened. It contains a waxed, sealed sack, now slit down the middle to reveal @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Joachim Hoflich’s} decomposed body!</p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} is given three pieces of paper, also found with the trunk. The largest (@JournalEntry[Handout 4]) shows a peculiar diagram. This is actually an overview of Wasmeier’s web of influence, designed to convince others of Hoflich’s treachery (outlined in ‘Wasmeier’s Plan’ above). </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/handout4.webp\" width=\"405\" height=\"405\" /></div>\n<p>The second (@JournalEntry[Handout 3]) bears the address of the pawns’ lair</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/handout3.webp\" width=\"311\" height=\"113\" /></div>\n<p>The final piece of paper is a handwritten note (@JournalEntry[Handout 2]), reading:</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/handout2.webp\" width=\"371\" height=\"138\" /></div>\n<p>This note, written by @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, was attached to Wasmeier’s own diagram of influence. The @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppelgänger} burned the original as instructed, but, having put the note aside, forgot all about it, and it fell behind the trunk. Obviously, the writer of the note was the fake Hoflich’s boss, which means he or she must be the real mastermind. All the Characters have to do is to find someone who recognises the handwriting — such as @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich}. It should prove quite entertaining as the Characters rush around the Palace asking people for copies of their handwriting! If the Characters fail to solve this problem, one of the Marshals will do so. In any event, recognition of the writing will produce a rush to Wasmeier’s apartment in the Palace.</p>\n<h4>Wasmeier Flees!</h4>\n<p>As outlined earlier, the evil Law Lord was waiting in his rooms for the Graf-Doppelgänger to summon him. His first knowledge of things going wrong is in the form of a Knight Panther appearing at his door to say that Law Lord Ehrlich requires his presence in the Graf ’s chambers, and that Law Lord Hoflich is accused of treachery.</p>\n<p>Dismissing the Knight, Wasmeier realises that his plan has failed. He consumes a <em>Potion of Invisibility</em> and casts @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.9wmmln3DunIqGXM2]{Flight} to leave undetected through a window. These were hidden in his apartment for just such a possibility.</p>\n<p>Thus, when the Characters arrive to deal out justice, they find the apartment empty.</p>\n<h4>Audience with the Graf</h4>\n<p>At the same time the Characters discover that the bird has flown, @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} has recovered enough to receive a briefing on recent events. He then sends for the Characters. They are admitted to the Graf ’s bedchamber, where the ruler of the city, despite his brush with death and his confinement to bed, will have some of his old spirit back.</p>\n<p>The @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess}’ and @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} will be close by his side, and all the influential NPCs (apart from @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} and @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle}) will also be present, along with his personal bodyguard of Knights Panther. The Ladies-at-Court, the @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Knight Eternal}, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel} and Goebbels will be waiting outside.</p>\n<p>The Graf addresses the party, somewhat sarcastically at first:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘My advisors tell me that you people, independent adventurers, seem to know more of what is going on than they do — so much so that you, rather than my Knights Panther, saved my life. For this I thank you, and you will be rewarded. Now I learn that the person responsible has fled the Palace, perhaps even the city. This cannot be borne: I command you to locate the traitor Wasmeier and bring his body back to me!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He waves one hand feebly, dismissing everyone except his daughter. The Characters will be praised by all major NPCs: the crisis seems to have done the Graf good. It looks like he has returned to his old self. Of course, there is still the matter of tracking Wasmeier down….</p>","folder":"8RbZHSArNQNSMvQ7","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 7: The Traitor Unmasked","sort":300000}}}

Shouting a prayer to Sigmar, the coachman drops the reins to cover his eyes, while the horses scream and rear in terror. As they bolt wildly to avoid the flying skull, the horses careen the coach against the trunk of a massive oak and the whole thing overturns, smashing both right-side wheels in the process.</p>\n<p>Anyone on the roof of the coach must make a Test against @Fear[2] in order to be able to do anything other than quiver with fright. A jump from the coach is treated as a distance of 3 yards. Hanging on to the coach requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Strength</strong> Test: success results in the Character taking a Damage 3 hit that ignores Armour, while failure means that the Character is flung clear and falls 3 yards. See @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.1gNxlCdPV1C3oZ6Z]{Leaping and Falling} for details on jumping and falling.</p>\n<p>Having had no warning, all those within the coach must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Agility</strong> Test to avoid taking a Damage 3 hit that ignores Armour. As the passengers begin to disentangle themselves, one of them (chosen at random) sees the skull heading west over the trees. See @Actor[FRS2PzhU3H98XfTX]{Flying Death Skulls} for a further description of the skull.</p>\n<p>The coach is beyond repair: only two wheels remain intact, and both axles are smashed. Hedric the coachman is lying in the road battered and bruised, but otherwise unhurt. Gunder, alas, suffered fatal injuries during the crash, when a trunk containing Elise’s ball gowns fell from the luggage rack and broke his neck. Two horses have run off, a third has a badly broken leg, and the other stands shivering nearby. The two girls are very upset but can be calmed by reassuring words. Hedric’s wide-eyed babble about the <em>‘swooping, red-eyed monster!’ </em>does little to help.</p>\n<h3>A Choice</h3>\n<p>The party has a number of options. They could stay put, but this would mean a night in the forest. Hedric points out that no other coach is due today, and in any case, would not stop for fear that the party was actually a gang of highwaymen. The next settlement of note on the route is Schöninghagen, but they could not reach it before nightfall. The obvious choice, and the one clearly favoured by Elise and Bertha, would be to walk back to the village of @JournalEntry[EgezB9BzxKmohox9]{Grubentreich}: the girls have relatives there who would put the Characters up for the night and see them safely to Schöninghagen the next day. If the Characters seem reluctant, the girls say that their relatives are sure to reward the brave adventurers for escorting them safely there.</p>\n<p>Hedric, a brave fellow who takes his duty seriously, declares that he has to ride the one remaining horse to Schöninghagen and inform the road wardens. He would not do so unless he is sure that the young ladies are safe in the Characters’ company, he says, but his duty is clear. The bulk of the luggage has to be left on the road (much to the passengers’ distress) and take its chances overnight: it can be recovered in the morning on the way to Schöninghagen.</p>\n<p>On foot, it takes an hour or so to reach @JournalEntry[EgezB9BzxKmohox9]{Grubentreich}. About half a mile outside the village, though, Bertha stumbles and twists her ankle. Any Character who successfully treats her with an <strong>Average (+20) Heal</strong> Test or carries her for the last half-mile wins her sincere gratitude, something which may prove useful during the events to come in Middenheim.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: WHY HERE?</em></h3>\n<p><em>Since the adventure’s first publication, it has been observed that the skull attack on the coach does not fit with the general pattern of skull activity, and does not advance the villain’s agenda at all: in fact, it leads to his ultimate downfall by bringing the Characters to the village. Experienced Players may wonder about this, even if they have not played ‘The Grapes of Wrath’ before, and if they manage to capture Gräber, they may question him on the matter.</em></p>\n<p><em>The fact is, it was a simple accident. He was testing the range of his control in an area far from the village where he did not expect to be disturbed, and a wasp flew down the neck of his jerkin. Distracted, he briefly lost control of the skull, which careened wildly out of the woods and across the road — and right into the path of the Characters’ coach.</em></p>\n<p><em>Gräber is embarrassed to admit this, though, since it is hardly the sort of mischance that should befall the great and dreaded @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gravelord}. </em></p>\n<p><em>Instead, he makes up some grandiose tale about recognising them from Altdorf and punishing them for killing his Carrion or whatever else they did to thwart him, but a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test leads the Characters to believe he is lying. Also, his hand strays unconsciously to the back of his neck as he speaks, and if the Characters examine the spot they will find an angry red welt, clearly caused by a wasp sting at about the time when their coach encountered the skull.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","img":null,"folder":"O0HfGcMmqK25GSdm","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":200000}}}

The Town Council spurns him.</p>\n<p>However, more than half of B&ouml;genhafen&rsquo;s private soldiers leave with Magnus anyway, convinced by his powerful rhetoric.

{"_id":"WbSeQAs9heusgsCA","name":"Perrin Lechart","content":"<p>Perrin appears as a grubby, drunken village idiot. In the best tradition of village idiots, he sits on fences sucking straws and winking knowingly at passers by. The young Perrin arrived in Maubast as a migrant worker 10 years ago, and stayed when the harvest was over.</p>\n<p>He began to act strangely 3 years later and is now completely insane.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the villagers took pity on him and feed him scraps.</p>\n<p>Perrin wanders freely around the whole area of Maubast, roaming deep into the forest when the mood takes him. He will talk to anyone who gives him food, and loyally follow anyone who gives him something shiny (like a silver shilling). Perrin’s speech is almost incomprehensible. For a start he no longer has any teeth, he is often drunk and/or delirious, but more importantly, he speaks a mixture of Bretonnian and Dark Tongue! PCs who know the Dark Tongue language will recognise it on a successful Perception Skill Test; a successful test by other PCs will simply reveal that Perrin is speaking a mixture of several languages.</p>\n<p>As a young man Perrin was interested in the rumours concerning a battle site in the area. He spent hours searching the forest and by chance came across the cave containing the warpstone (and skulls).</p>\n<p>Perrin began to dig where the skulls lay, hoping to find some treasure. All he found was a bit of rock and would have dug deeper had not one of the skulls moved! He fled clutching the rock, which was kept as a lucky charm. He now uses it in place of his teeth to help chew tough bits of food.</p>\n<p>Warpstone does not make for a lucky charm and Perrin’s brain began to suffer as a result. He lost many of his skills, while at the same his speech began to include elements of Dark Tongue.</p>\n<p>However, Perrin’s body benefited from the Chaos source, getting increasingly tough and resilient as the years have passed. With his brain corrupted, Perrin is immune to the effects of Fear and no longer feels any pain. All these attributes will be lost permanently if Perrin is separated from his bit of warpstone for more than a day, becoming in all respects a normal idiot. He cannot be cured of his insanity by any standard means.</p>\n<p>If Perrin loses his “lucky charm” (and he won’t give it to anyone without a struggle), he will get very upset. Soon afterwards he will set off back to the cave to obtain another piece. Being so attuned to Chaos, he will have no trouble locating it; curious PCs may learn something to their advantage. However, if he does get a new piece of warpstone, he will change in new and different ways.</p>","folder":"yB7s0OOrS3UGCVZv","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

Hieronymus Juniper is a local halfling who deals with imports of Mootland goods into Altdorf and their distribution to various shops and restaurants. He is an elder of the halfling community (through status rather than age) and he is an inveterate busybody. Since the second pattern killing Hiero (to his friends) has taken it on himself to voice the concerns of the halfling community to the Watch by pestering them constantly and blaming the continuing</p>\n<p>freedom of the killer on an institutionalised prejudice against halflings. He has enlisted the support of Markus Edvard Schmidt, an aging (and slightly demented) Verenan Investigator and Drago Vedris, a hard nosed reporter for the Altdorf Spieler.</p>\n<p>This episode should be played partly for laughs, and the GM should endeavour to make these three characters as grotesque as possible, and also to introduce the players to Drago, who is the Pattern Killer. In order to interject some degree of pathos into the scenario Drago should appear to be the most sympathetic of the 3 NPCs. Try to make him a self-effacing and humorous man, in comparison to Hiero&rsquo;s aggressive and unreasonable demands and Schmidt&rsquo;s rambling and disconnection. PCs may ask Drago if he can contact his Tilean colleague Mario Machi to help them with the Tileans back at the station. If so he is happy to help and agrees to meet them back at the station in thirty minutes. It is important to give Drago a noticeable verbal tic, however, as this will provide a clue to his guilt. A loud and highpitched feminine giggle is suggested here, and Drago should perform this a couple of times.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;No, I will NOT just be fobbed off on your captain.</p>\n<p>The halfling population of Altdorf have a RIGHT to know about what the putative &ldquo;Watch&rdquo; are doing in order to bring this murderer to justice, and I demand to know what you and your patrol are doing to help, as is only MY RIGHT, would you agree Markus?&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Erm, yes, ahem! There are many amongst our order who stress the wisdom of gathering information from not only those in positions of high authority but also those laymen who, whilst not so exalted, often have a practical perspective that proves enlightening - not all of us, I feel I must say, in order to be honest with you, which I only feel is the right thing to do - but yes, urm, I feel Hieronymus is correct in his belief and his assertion that you should furnish us with any pertinent information you may have gleaned, or even ...&rdquo; </em></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, so, what are YOU doing to catch this man? As a trader in Mootland goods to Altdorf for over twenty years now I feel I am rightly placed to act on behalf of Altdorf&rsquo;s marginalised halfling community to find out exactly what the Watch are doing to find this killer! I mean, everyone knows the Watch is institutionally prejudiced against halflings! How many halflings are employed as Watchmen in Altdorf? Precisely none! Is that just I ask you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Hem! Well. Ahem! Whilst many within my order say that a system of proportional representation is the only just course of action in terms of fair employment other voices do stress the wisdom of choosing the right person for the right role&hellip;&rdquo; </em></p>\n<p>&ldquo;What are you implying Markus? That halflings make bad Watchmen? Is THAT it?

If Wasmeier needed to apply pressure, he would make it known that she has many stolen and even heretical volumes in her private library, some taken illicitly from the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Wizards Guild}.</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>Mueller is High Priestess of Verena in Middenheim and as such she has an important role in the religious and secular life of the city. The latter is enshrined in formal connections between the cult, the Law Lords, and the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists}. She is occasionally asked to arbitrate on matters of justice or lead prayers in the courts.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Mueller lives in chambers above the temple library, the official residence of the High Priestess. On most days, she stays in the temple to conduct cult business or study. At other times, she officiates in the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists} in @JournalEntry[2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt}. She meets with the @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{Law Lords} on occasion in the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{The Palace}. As the sole non-Ulrican patron of the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, she can be found there on occasion. </p>\n<p>Edel is easy to meet if someone has academic or priestly status. Alternatively, anyone offering to sell books meets an enthusiastic response.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Mueller is disappointed by the world, so she expects little of people — she is immune to the Charm Skill. She has respect for intelligence — if a party member has an Intelligence of above 40, they benefit from +10 to Fellowship Tests. </p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Mueller has a skewed idea of who influences the Graf. She assumes correctly that the @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{Law Lords}, @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Midden Marshals}, and @JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{wizards} have his ear, because they represent power. Beyond that she is unsure who might persuade him to repeal the tax.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>She assumes that @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Schmiedehammer}, @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Lafarel}, @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Schlagen}, and @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} have no influence — because why would the Graf care what they think?</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Mueller wants to see the tax repealed — it’s bad for the @JournalEntry[bBgwBPu0zugAPooq]{Cult of Verena} and the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Wizards’ Guild}. It’s unjust, and even a disillusioned priestess still cares when her goddesses’s justice is violated. She also desires rare books — she currently has her eye on a copy of <em>The New Apocrypha (Volume 4)</em>, a banned text that she believes is hidden in the back room at the @JournalEntry[RVJixZcIIRAwZdC8]{Vermilion Pawn}, a pawnshop in @JournalEntry[ZWV1AbhVVbWfbEIz]{Neumarkt} that carries items of sorcerous nature.</p>\n<h2>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</h2>\n<p>High Priestess Mueller mixes mainly with the city’s educated classes, but she’s recognised throughout the city as an important figure</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>Mueller knows many of the main NPCs and has regular contact with the more educated characters. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: Mueller is slightly dismissive of him as she thinks he has no imagination, calling him the ‘Drab Abacus’ behind his back. She’s heard he’s recently discovered women, which made her roll her eyes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: She once dismissed him as a stereotypically thick-headed warrior; she was pleasantly surprised by his interest in the history of his role. But last time she met him, he behaved oddly when asked about the tax. While she’s not quite a friend, she can easily provide an introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: Mueller is interested in him because Elves are known to have knowledge hidden from Humans. But she doesn’t trust the influence of the Eonir in Middenheim for that exact reason. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: She considers Katarina a vacuous ornament — of no real importance to serious people or the city of Middenheim.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: A judgemental old rat bag, but harmless enough. She can put in a good word and introduce the Characters to the Chaperone, purely by using her status in the city.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: They’re not her kind of people, but she respects their pragmatism — they’re refreshingly free of the pomposity of most military types and don’t abuse their position.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Mueller is very interested in the wizards and welcomes them to the Temple of Verena. She covets more books from the Wizards’ Guild’s library and has been considering how she might acquire them. If the party want to meet Helseher or Eberhauer, she can introduce them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: She has dealings with Ar-Ulric as one of the city’s religious leaders, and they meet in his capacity as Patron of the Collegium Theologica. She thinks he’s slightly better than your average Ulrican, but not by much. She heard rumours from a student at the Collegium that he is being blackmailed for something, but she’s not sure she believes it.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: No dealings with them, and assumes that they’re fairly dim. She surprised herself when she met Kirsten Jung to discuss her forthcoming nuptials and found her a good-hearted bride-to-be.  </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} – Knight Eternal</strong>: She tolerates him with gritted teeth, as his knowledge of history and collection of military history tomes is impressive.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: Mueller has no dealings with him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Mueller has no dealings with him, but has heard he once had a bad reputation.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: She thinks he’s a charlatan and is taking advantage of the Graf to enjoy his hospitality.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Edel knows them better than most NPCs. She likes Ehrlich and noticed his depression, for which she has sympathy. She hates Hoflich as someone who seems to enjoy punishment. She admires Wasmeier for his scholarship and intelligence. If the party want to meet with the Law Lords and Mueller supports them, she can give them a letter of introduction to help.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Edel enjoys some of the cultural aspects of the Carnival and attends with a few priests from the temple.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>:@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}; <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Opera The Barbarian of Sevile}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Druidic life sculptures}; @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Synchronised flying displays}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Opera The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Opera The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied};</em> @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Black Pool Illuminations Finale}</p>","folder":"hQfHL1VS2zKPRt1T","sort":600000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":600000}}}

Guests begin to arrive on Angestag afternoon (the second-last day of the week), and the twenty-four hours before the wedding will prove to be quite eventful.</p>\n<p>Set out below is roughly what will happen during that time, subject to the effects of whatever the Characters decide to do &mdash; and to whatever tweaks, changes, and additional events you decide to throw in. The more, the merrier!</p>\n<h3>Angestag Afternoon</h3>\n<p>The trickle of guests arriving by road and river turns into a flood. At about 3:00 p.m. the river liner Emperor Wilhelm arrives amid much excitement, carrying most of the von Liebwitz party (assuming the Grand Duchess Emmanuelle pulled some strings to appropriate the liner; if not, the gravin and her staff arrive by barge). Although the Countess is not attending the wedding in person, she has sent several gifts with the small group of Nuln von Liebwitzes who have come along with their Ambosstein cousins.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the personal barges of other noble guests draw up alongside the castle&rsquo;s landing stage. Occasional scuffles break out between crew members when two or more barges arrive at the same time. Nobles &mdash; especially minor nobles &mdash; are very conscious of status and precedence: everyone has an opinion about whose boat should be the next to dock, and no one likes to be kept waiting.</p>\n<h3>Angestag Evening</h3>\n<p>A feast is held in the Great Hall to welcome the guests. @Actor[UsGTyYsKgNEo99yf]{Graf Wilhelm von Saponatheim} has spared no expense, even engaging legendary Bretonnian chef @Actor[1hFU3Yy7BNnxGIDd]{Marcel de Morceaux} for the occasion.</p>\n<p>Entertainers of all kinds amuse the guests, including a troupe of acrobats from faraway Ind. Gossip and scandal run up and down the hall as the assembled nobles get down to doing what nobles do best.</p>\n<p>Amid the merry-making, observant Characters will notice a few things.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test (<strong>Average (+20)</strong> for Entertainers) spots the acrobats from Ind are not playing the hall like the other entertainers. They start off moving around, collecting money thrown on the floor like everyone else, but after a few minutes pay close attention to a group of nobles from Telland. Any Courtier who learns this may make a <strong>Challenging (+20) Intelligence</strong> Test to recall that Countess Clothilde of Telland &mdash; who is sitting with the group in question &mdash; has been showing off a pink ruby all season. The ruby is said to have been bought by her son when he last sailed to Ind. The party may also notice that a richly dressed &lsquo;Halfling&rsquo; &mdash; in fact, Glimbrin in disguise &mdash; is watching the Countess and the Indish performers closely. If confronted, Glimbrin will fake a high-brow accent he learned from Seedling &mdash; his Halfling friend from A Rough Night at the Three Feathers &mdash; and attempt to remove himself from the situation.</p>\n<p>A<strong> Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test notes the bride-to-be, while outwardly radiant, looks around from time to time as if scanning the hall for someone or something. She does not even glance at the bridegroom. Karl-Heinz the bridegroom, for his part, is enraptured by an elegant sword that is to be his wedding gift from his new father-in-law. The blade placed on display in a glass case for all to see. Karl-Heinz spends much of the evening engaged in an excited discussion with Graf Wilhelm as they both fawn over its design. As the wine flows, Karl-Heinz cannot help but boast and brag about the heroic acts he will achieve with such a sword by his side.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test (<strong>Average (+20</strong>) for Courtiers, <strong>Easy (+40)</strong> for Rogues) spots a couple of the guests who seem out of place (this information is automatic for any Character with the <em>Etiquette (Nobles)</em> Talent). They are as expensively dressed as anyone else, but their clothes somehow don&rsquo;t quite fit them properly. They keep to themselves, and don&rsquo;t seem to know anyone else at the feast. Nobles may think they are provincial merchants who have somehow wangled an invitation, but Rogues will have no doubt they are criminals of some sort.</p>\n<p>At some time in the evening, the two sidle up to a table near the bottom of the hall, position themselves on either side of a young male guest, and a quiet but clearly heated exchange takes place. Courtiers may attempt a<strong> Challenging (+0) Intelligence</strong> Test to know that the young guest is a cousin of the von Saponatheims, Graf Johann von Gient, recently returned from Marienburg.</p>\n<p>You may add other incidents and events at will. For instance, drunken young nobles may decide to have a duel in the hall or somewhere else in the castle.</p>\n<p>A couple may slip off for a secret assignation, and be caught in flagrante delicto in some bedchamber, crypt, or shrubbery. A visiting servant may try to slip a piece of von Saponatheim silverware inside his or her clothing, or offer to sell family secrets to a rival. Practical jokes and acts of petty theft and vandalism may take place. Wine is flowing and high-spirited young Nobles are having a good time, so almost anything could happen.</p>\n<p>The feast ends around 11:00 p.m. Guests drift, stagger, and are carried to the various guest rooms. Nastassia is among the first to leave the tables, pleading a headache. By midnight, the Great Hall is deserted apart from a few servants clearing away the ruins of the feast and a cluster of crusty old Barons gathered around a brandy keg, loudly re-enacting various historical battles on an empty table using salt cellars, wine glasses, and pieces of fruit.</p>\n<h3>12 midnight</h3>\n<p>Albrecht&rsquo;s thugs (Plot 4) go to von Gient&rsquo;s room, having bribed one of the servants to find out its location. There is a muffled yell (requiring a <strong>Challenging (+0)</strong> Perception Test to hear if close by), and then everything is quiet.</p>\n<p>The two leave after some ten minutes, having stripped the room of all its valuables. They sneak out of the castle and head off downriver, where a boat waits to take them home to Marienburg.</p>\n<h3>12:15 a.m.</h3>\n<p>There is a commotion at the foot of the stairs leading to the solar tower. Graf Wilhelm has staggered out and collapsed, dragging a suit of armor noisily to the floor. White-faced and gasping, he stammers incoherently about a monster in his room. A rapid search by the servants turns up no trace of an intruder.</p>\n<p>The Graf has already failed a Psychology Test to resist <strong>Terror 3 </strong>and has three Broken Conditions; it is impossible to get any sense out of him. The Characters can try to calm him in any of the normal ways, though the servants may misinterpret their intentions and try to &lsquo;protect&rsquo; him. Once calm, he claims he was awakened by a glowing, snarling figure with a rotting head and golden jewellery. The thing made no attempt to harm him, but seemed angry and spoke harshly in a foreign tongue.</p>\n<p>The apparition was Inta-Dapesht, a Nehekharan Wraith (Plot 3).</p>\n<p>It was disturbed when its tomb was looted and the sword recently acquired by the graf was stolen. It has stayed close to the graf, seething with anger, but is taking advantage of its Ethereal nature to hide in a nearby wall.</p>\n<p>Once the graf gathers his wits, he shrilly demands the Characters exorcise the Wraith, or otherwise make the sword &lsquo;disappear&rsquo;. He states that the blade cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of the Ambossteins in this cursed state, for they will take any such gifts as an attempt to harm their family. However, he cannot arbitrarily deny the young bridegroom the gift given he loves it so.</p>\n<p>The spirit will then show itself again &mdash; along with its Terror 3 Trait &mdash; making the graf scream and faint. Unfortunately, Inta-Dapesht only speaks the ancient language of Nehekhara. It is unlikely any of the Characters can speak Nehekharan, but a <strong>Very Hard (&minus;30) Language (Magick</strong>) or <strong>Language (Arabyan) </strong>Test will allow a Character to pick out odd words here and there, and piece together enough of the message to understand. If Inta-Dapesht is attacked or otherwise offended &mdash; in other words, if the sword is not packed away and shipped back to Nehekhara &mdash; it will attack. Otherwise, it will accompany the sword back to its tomb, punishing anyone who interferes or delays its return as it goes.</p>\n<h3>12:30 a.m.</h3>\n<p>There is a scream from von Gient&rsquo;s room. A serving-maid, with whom he had made an assignation for the night, went to his room and found that it had been thoroughly wrecked.</p>\n<p>Von Gient is dead, tied to the bed with signs of having been severely beaten. Strangest of all, a fresh herring is wedged between his teeth. A successful <strong>Very Easy (+60) Lore (Marienburg</strong>) Test, or a <strong>Challenging (+0) Intelligence Test (Easy (+40)</strong> for racketeers; <strong>Average (+20)</strong> for Rogues), allows a Character to recognise the calling-card of the dreaded Marienburg crime lord, Albrecht the Fish.</p>\n<h3>12:45 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Outside the von Saponatheim family apartments, servants&nbsp;intercept a young guest who appears to have lost his way. He seems too drunk to speak &mdash; unable even to give his name or the name of his family so that he can be directed to the right quarters.</p>\n<p>This is Joachim Bitterfeld, the jeweller&rsquo;s apprentice from Altdorf who is planning to elope with the Baroness Nastassia.</p>\n<p>He has lost his way and is pretending to be drunk in the hope of being left alone so he can keep looking for Nastassia&rsquo;s room. A successful <strong>Average (+20) Intuition</strong> or <strong>Consume Alcohol</strong> Test will reveal that his drunkenness is feigned. Anyone who tries to search him will find that he is wearing two sets of clothes &mdash; one set is a disguise for Nastassia so that they can sneak out of the castle together.</p>\n<p>If left alone, Joachim will keep looking for Nastassia&rsquo;s room. He may cause disturbances from time to time as he goes into wrong rooms in various parts of the castle. He can be used as a distraction or an added complication whenever and wherever you choose.</p>\n<h3>1:00 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Many of the castle&rsquo;s servants are drunk by now, having finished off any partially empty cups and bottles they found while clearing away the feast. Left alone in the cellars, Manfred (Plot 6) has managed to free himself. He bursts into the kitchens, breaking the necks of two servants before anyone knows what is happening.</p>\n<p>With the strength of the desperate, he shrugs off all attempts to stop him, making his way up to the main hall.</p>\n<p>Unless he is stopped, Manfred will go through the family apartments, into the solar tower, and up to the master bedroom to kill his father. What he lacks in mental acuity he more than makes up in physical strength and rage.</p>\n<p>Stopping Manfred is a delicate matter. As a nobleman &mdash; despite his condition &mdash; it is theoretically illegal for a member of the lower orders to lay violent hands upon him. Graf Wilhelm may overlook this if Manfred can be subdued quickly and quietly, and returned to the cellars before anyone outside the family learns the truth. If Manfred is wounded, there will be consequences: paradoxically, though, the consequences for killing Manfred may be less severe if no one outside the family learns that he ever existed. His death, after all, solves a problem for the family by leaving Nastassia unchallenged as Graf Wilhelm&rsquo;s heir. However, if Manfred&rsquo;s existence becomes known, his killers will pay the price for the family&rsquo;s embarrassment as well as for killing him.</p>\n<h3>1:15 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Nastassia leaves her room to look for Joachim (see 12:45 a.m.). If she encounters anyone along the way she pretends to be sleepwalking, and will not resist anyone who tries to wake her and conduct her back to her room. Instead, she waits a few minutes before leaving again in search of her secret lover.</p>\n<p>Anyone who enters her room after this time will find a note to her father propped up on her dressing table. The note explains that she has eloped with her true love rather than face this arranged marriage.</p>\n<h3>1:30 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Posing as a wedding guest, the Dammenblatz agent (Plot 1) went to another guest&rsquo;s room (choose a guest of your own creation, preferably one with a connection to the Characters, or simply use a minor noble) to share a bottle of brandy or other nocturnal activity. The agent then quietly murders the other guest, and then sets out to take the body to the gravin&rsquo;s room. If encountered, the agent will pretend to be drunk: using the Entertain (Acting) Skill as best as possible. The agent claims the other guest has drunk himself unconscious, quite dead to the world, and will accept help in getting him back to his room; if successful, the agent will wait 15 minutes before trying again.</p>\n<p>When arriving at the gravin&rsquo;s room, the agent breaks in quietly and administers Moonflower vapours (WFRP, p, 306) from a small fire-pot to make sure she stays asleep. The body is then dumped by her bed, and a bloody dagger is left near her hand.</p>\n<p>The agent then scatters pages from a scandalous pamphlet about the room. While the pamphlet claims to describe and illustrate the rites of &lsquo;THE PRINTS OF PLESHUR&rsquo;, it is simple pornography and contains no heretical (or useful) information.</p>\n<p>Finally, the agent rings for the gravin&rsquo;s maid and hides under the bed while the maid discovers the body, planning to sneak out when the alarm is raised. If escape proves difficult, the agent will blend in with the crowd of guests and servants drawn by the maid&rsquo;s screams.</p>\n<h3>1:45 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Unless prevented, Nastassia and Joachim find each other and slip off into the closed wings so she can change into her disguise. This process takes about ten minutes, and then the two &lsquo;young nobles&rsquo; try to sneak out of the castle.</p>\n<h3>2:00 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Six young nobles (Plot 5) emerge from various guest rooms and make their way down to the wine cellar. If challenged, they pretend to be helping themselves to more wine and brandy.</p>\n<p>Once in the cellars, the cultists bar the door from the inside and begin their profane ritual. If Kavenner is alive, he leads the ritual. If Rechtshandler lives and is a Mutant, he cowers in the corner, sobbing over his sorry lot in life. A low chanting and the occasional moan and muffled scream may be heard through the cellar door if anyone listens carefully with an Average (+20) Perception Test.</p>\n<p>The cultists are casting a spell that will summon a number of Daemonettes to the castle. Once the summoning is complete, the cultists unbar the cellar door and the Daemonettes rampage through the castle in an orgy of destruction, pain, and worse. You should decide how many Daemonettes are summoned according to the capability of the Characters: there should be enough to provide a hard fight for the party and any allies it can muster, but not enough to ensure a one-sided slaughter. If matters look like they are getting out of hand, simply bring more of Graf Wilhelm&rsquo;s soldiers in to help.</p>\n<h3>2:15 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Four taggee (Plot 7) sneak out of the entertainers&rsquo; quarters and head for Dowager-Duchess Clothilde&rsquo;s rooms. They may be encountered anywhere you wish over the next 5-10 minutes as they attempt to locate their quarry. They are well-trained and extremely wary, and will avoid encounters when possible.</p>\n<p>At about the same time, Graf Josef von Angendorf has made his transformation into the notorious jewel thief, the Wraith. A black-clad figure slips out of the window of Graf Josef &rsquo;s guest room and climbs around the outside of the castle towards the dowager-duchess&rsquo;s chambers.</p>\n<p>If the taggee recover the ruby, they kill the dowager-duchess as an act of retribution and stealthily leave the castle, stealing a boat and heading downstream.</p>\n<p>If the Wraith steals the ruby before the taggee, they climb out of the window in pursuit of the thief. If the Characters become involved, this can lead to a dangerous but very entertaining running battle on the castle&rsquo;s walls and rooftops.</p>\n<p>Regardless of who steals the gem, Glimbrin will be waiting for them on the roof, and observes the escape. Begrudgingly, Glimbrin recognises he cannot hope to stop either party, so seeks out any of the Characters who have been sympathetic to him in the past. He explains the gem is stolen, and encourages them to give chase.</p>\n<p>If the Characters manage to recover the stolen gem, Glimbrin will, in turn, attempt to steal it from them, or offer any number of small trinkets &mdash; and even explosive devices if he was successful in his attempts during A Night at the Opera &mdash; in exchange. If pressed, and Glimbrin sees no way to recover the gem, he will make an impassioned speech about how the gem is the secret to defending his homelands from utter destruction. Of course, this is a lie.</p>\n<h3>Festag Morning</h3>\n<p>Assuming the castle isn&rsquo;t in lockdown because of the daemonic attack, servants begin to stir around 5:00 a.m. Some head for the kitchens to prepare the wedding breakfast; others head for the rooms of their aristocratic charges, ready to wash and dress them for the great day.</p>\n<p>In short order, screams of horror and cries of outrage are heard from various parts of the castle as the results of the night&rsquo;s events are discovered. This is an opportunity for you to involve the Characters in any plot that has escaped their notice so far.</p>\n<h3>The Runaways</h3>\n<p>If the bride and her paramour have managed to leave the castle, Gravin Maria-Ulrike will send the Characters after them. &lsquo;This is a very delicate situation,&rsquo; she explains. &lsquo;They must be recovered before word gets out. I don&rsquo;t care what you have to do, whom you have to bribe, or how much &mdash; just make sure they are both back before the end of the day. I&rsquo;ll do what I can to slow things down here &mdash; I&rsquo;ll spread the word that she&rsquo;s sick &mdash; but the wedding must go ahead. And don&rsquo;t hurt the young man; it&rsquo;s not his fault, really. Bring them both directly to me, and make sure no one else sees you.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>The errant pair made their way to the river, intending to steal a small boat from the moorings downstream of the castle. They planned to go downstream to Altdorf, where Joachim has a priestess of Shallya ready to marry them &mdash; although she does not know who Nastassia is, and the bride will be using a false name. From there, Joachim will collect his belongings from his lodgings, having already taken leave of his master to begin life as a journeyman. He plans to set out for Marienburg with his new bride, there to seek his fortune.</p>\n<p>You can decide how far the pair&rsquo;s plan has advanced. By dawn, they may be partway to Altdorf, but the adventurers will be able to catch them up in a few hours. Joachim is not a skilled sailor, and is unfamiliar with the stolen boat.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the pair may have been delayed at the moorings as Joachim tried to find a suitable vessel to steal. They may have been spotted by a boatman or other guard, and since the custom of the river is to string up boat thieves without trial, the adventurers may arrive just in time to save their lives. No one, after all, is going to believe a young slip of a girl &mdash; dressed in men&rsquo;s clothing, no less &mdash; when she is caught trying to steal a boat and tries to get out of trouble by claiming to be the young bride from the castle!</p>\n<p>It would be quite the tragedy should the Characters arrive too late in such circumstances.</p>\n<h3>The Heir</h3>\n<p>Even if Manfred&rsquo;s escape was contained and his existence remains a secret, the von Saponatheims &mdash; under some pressure from their soon-to-be in-laws &mdash; have decided that he should be sent away in secret, and housed under a false name in some place far, far away. Gravin Maria-Ulrike has arranged for her personal physician to drug the heir to Schloss Grauenberg with a powerful sedative, and orders the Characters to conduct him to the Great Hospice of Shallya at Frederheim (just north of Altdorf ), or some similar institution elsewhere in the Empire.</p>\n<p>The journey can be as simple or as complicated as you wish.</p>\n<p>Manfred&rsquo;s constitution is unusually strong, and the drug may not keep him fully subdued. Some rivals of the von Saponatheims &mdash; or worse, an agent working for Baron von Dammenblatz or perhaps the Toppenheimers &mdash; might get hold of the rumour that the true heir to Saponatheim is being moved in secret, and complicate the adventurers&rsquo; lives still further. Even if all goes well, any long journey in the Empire is fraught with perils great and small, especially when one is conveying an unwilling human cargo.</p>\n<h3>The Assassin</h3>\n<p>Gravin Maria-Ulrike is in no doubt that von Dammenblatz was behind the attempt to frame her for murder in the night. If the assassin has not yet been captured, the Characters are sent to finish the job. &lsquo;Kill the Dammenblatz fool only if you have to,&rsquo; she orders. &lsquo;Such creatures are far more valuable alive. If I can make the cretin name the Dammenblatz&rsquo;s in court, I can turn the tables and put this wretched business to rest once and for all.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Easy enough for a noblewoman to say, of course. Tracking and capturing a skilled assassin &mdash; especially one as talented as Dominique Herveaux, if she still lives &mdash; is not simple, even for a seasoned group of adventurers. If they can succeed in their mission, though, they will win the gravin&rsquo;s undying gratitude &mdash; and her determination to keep them, and their dangerous knowledge, close to her for the rest of their lives.</p>\n<h3>The Cultists</h3>\n<p>The followers of Slaanesh include the young and foolish scions of some prominent families (you can choose which according to the needs of your campaign), and Gravin Maria-Ulrike is determined to detain and identify them all &mdash; without allowing word to reach the Witch Hunters (specifically the ever vigilant Matthias Hubkind, page 34, who may still be on her trail since Nuln). Those from allied houses will be gently but firmly shown the error of their ways, and their misdeeds covered up; those from rival houses will be turned into useful assets, providing social and political leverage against their families.</p>\n<p>A secondary objective &mdash; to the gravin, at least &mdash; will be to identify other branches of the cult that seduced the young nobles, and ensure two things: first, that its members are punished for compromising members of the nobility; and second, that they are left in no condition to name the young aristocrats and embarrass them or their families in the future.</p>\n<p>A group of mercenaries, with no formal ties to any noble house, make a conveniently deniable instrument for such a task. This could even make an interesting side adventure if your Players fancy playing different Characters for a while.</p>\n<p>If either Kavenner or Rechtshandler were involved with the summoning, the gravin is swift and brutal in her pronouncement: she wants them seized, burned, and buried. She then instructs her servants to erase any trace of evidence connecting her, or her cousin the Countess, to either of them.</p>\n<h3>The Gem</h3>\n<p>If Dowager-Duchess Clothilde of Telland survived the night, she will want her ruby back; if not, there will be widespread interest in tracing both the gem and the venerable lady&rsquo;s murderers. While Gravin Maria-Ulrike has no great personal stake in the wellbeing of the Countess or the whereabouts of the gem, there is prestige to be gained for her house if she &mdash; or rather, her agents &mdash; can resolve the situation.</p>\n<p>The taggee are heading down the Reik to Marienburg, intending to take ship for Ind as soon as possible &mdash; unless the Wraith or Glimbrin stole the gem first, in which case they are hot on the culprit&rsquo;s trail. Bringing a noble to trial for theft will be a tricky business, but if the Characters can lay convincing proof before the gravin, she will take the matter in hand. However, rather than having Graf Josef von Angendorf arrested, she will try to turn him into an unwilling accomplice, to be used under the threat of blackmail whenever the gravin needs to acquire an item under less than legal circumstances. If the Characters are instead trying to catch Glimbrin, they&rsquo;ll have their work cut out for them, as this is the Gnome&rsquo;s last caper before raiding his stash of stolen goods, then heading back to the Mirror Moors and his home in Glimdwarrow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

{"_id":"Wue7onedBCazx3ea","name":"Devouring the World","content":"<p>By now the Characters may have become accustomed to the facing off against cultists of the Ruinous Powers. While always terrifying, the may feel that they have come to understand their enemy. However, there are others powers at work in the world, and one in particular has plagued Middenheim since its very founding.</p>\n<p>Of all the enemies that faced Middenheim throughout the ages, the first, and perhaps the greatest, was @Actor[AGyoIt9stdSin46x]{Babrakkos the Liche-Thing}. The undying creature is so integral to the legends surrounding Middenheim’s early days that it is sometimes known as the First Threat. A vile undead monstrosity, Babrakkos remains a puzzle to the scholars of the Collegium Theologica, for it bears little resemblance to Vampires or the revenant kings of distant Khemri. Yet its connection to such things is undeniable. Babrakkos cheated death and commanded animated corpses as its soldiers and servants.</p>\n<p>While Babrakkos could be said to have been killed, there is no place in Morr’s realm for such a foul abomination. Its spirit still lingers around Middenheim in anticipation of the day it will return to lay waste to the heirs of the heroes who once slew it.</p>\n<p>A group called @JournalEntry[Z4vImEgqDM5OcViY]{The Eaters of the World} has grown up around the worship of Babrakkos. They seek to usher in their master’s return, and have long been hunted in Middenheim. In the present day their influence is reduced but not gone. They prefer to work through subtle means, spreading crescent shaped icons of the creature across the city. This has the effect of slowly increasing their master’s presence. In a nameless cellar the cultists gather to give praise, and in an unmarked throne a half scene figure slowly grows more substantial. Babrakkos will return once more, and Middenheim will burn.</p>\n<h3>Unbidden Gifts </h3>\n<p>While the Characters are enjoying the events of the carnival, they are approached by one Eric Schmidt, a young man dressed in carnival attire who is freely handing out small amulets. They are small crescent moons cheaply made and tied to a simple hemp twine. He pushes one to the hands of at least one Character, and bids them to wear it. </p>\n<p>If asked about the meaning of the amulet, Eric will shrug and say they are from a tradition as old as Middenheim, and represent rebirth. He will then continue down the street handing out the amulets to random passers by.</p>\n<p>If the Characters choose to wear the amulet, they will notice little effect during the first day. However, for each additional day they wear it, make an <strong>Average (+20) Cool</strong> Test on behalf of the Character. If they fail, they are troubled by bad dreams of a shadowy figure just out of sight, resting on an unadored throne. If they suffer an Impressive Failure or worse, they also gain one @Condition[Fatigued] Condition which lasts for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>In Middenheim, the prevalence of Ghur makes it hard to pick up on subtle magical details, so any investigation of the amulet by a Character with Magic Sight will reveal little if undertaken inside the city. However, if the amulet is studied outside of Middenheim a subtle note of Shyish can be detected. </p>\n<p>If the Characters look for Eric Schmidt, he can be found around the @JournalEntry[UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{Great Park} during the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}, and later outside the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal Opera House}, still handing out his amulets. If confronted he will plead ignorance, but offer to take the amulet back. He will continue to plead innocent until a chance to escape presents itself, at which point he will hiss <em>‘May his hunger find you last of all,’</em> before sprinting off. If killed, they will see a look of calm cross Schmidts face as he dies, before his eyes roll back in his head and he screams <em>‘Babrakkos! My soul to feed yours!\"</em></p>\n<p>If the Characters pursue this further, they find themselves the target of yet another cult with agents at every level of Middenheim society.

This was the third piece in the pattern and the one that convinced Ernst Bl&uuml;cher that he would be the next victim. He was also sure that Gertrude is not equipped to deal with the investigation, and insisted that professionals are hired. Freide&rsquo;s murder was a great shock to Zahndahl as she had only been talking to her the day before about the case.</p>\n<p>Freide was a master of the Cobblers&rsquo; Guild. She was the Dockland&rsquo;s most experienced cobbler, and generally well-liked and respected. She had a reputation for being stern and overcorrect about etiquette, but was not unpleasant about it.</p>\n<p>She lived with her husband above her shop on the Rattelanger Durchgang not far from Schlingbach&rsquo;s shop. Unnerved by the previous murders, she had already taken precautions. Her attic bedroom is reached by a loose ladder that goes to a trapdoor, and so at night she pulled the ladder up after her.

Therefore, the Characters have the run of the largely untouched murder scene instead of having to rely on Zahndahl&rsquo;s second-hand accounts.</p>\n<p>Schlypper&rsquo;s husband, Gunther, is a witness to the events.</p>\n<p>According to him, they were woken by a knocking on the shop door, in the small hours. After the knocking would not cease, Gunther had the idea to take his pistol, and go down and see who it was. They put the ladder down for him but made sure that Friede pulled it up behind him and secured the trap door.</p>\n<p>When Schlypper got to the front door no one was there. But almost immediately he heard the noise of a struggle from upstairs, and his wife calling his name. He spent the best part of half an hour waking his neighbours to borrow their ladder. By the time he broke through the trapdoor with an axe, Friede was dead.</p>\n<p>They found her body in an extraordinary state. It still lies where it was found. Coins have been shoved into her mouth and down her throat, making her choke and suffocate. In addition, coins have been sewn onto her skin as if sequins adorning a gown.</p>\n<p>About 50 coins have been sown this way. An expert, like Bl&uuml;cher, would be able to say that three individual cobblers worked on sewing the coins, all with their distinctive, but similarly neat styles. But he is unlikely to agree to go anywhere near her house.</p>\n<p>There are also many small scratches and bruises over her body.</p>\n<p>These are just the marks of the physical struggle she had with the Daemons before they could completely overpowered her.</p>\n<p>The shutters remain barred. In fact, Zahndahl opened the shutters yesterday so she might have a better look at the body but decided she had better shut them again to maintain the crime scene.</p>\n<p>There seems to be no way in or out of the room, save for the trapdoor. By all accounts the trapdoor was well constructed and maintained, although it is firewood now.</p>\n<p>Gunther can confirm the coins came from their savings box, which was hidden in a recess behind their headboard. None of the money seems to be missing, and no one knew about the box except the couple.</p>\n<p>The Characters might notice a small, rotting chunk of something or other on the floor near to Schlypper&rsquo;s body, a piece of apple with some sticky sugary stuff attached. Schn&auml;ker stole a toffee apple from Moe Kassin at the fair and took it with him to eat while waiting for this job to start. A Character who has bought a toffee apple from Kassin earlier would have a better chance of realising exactly what it is.</p>\n<p>The Characters might also notice that there are lots of tiny tracks in the soot around the fireplace. These were made by the Daemons&rsquo; stick-like feet but they look more like scratches than footprints. Having climbed down the chimney on a length of yarn, the creatures were covered in soot. They left tiny traces of soot everywhere they have been and on everything they touched. This would not have been apparent at the previous murder scenes because both rooms had been well disturbed and tidied, and even cleaned, since the murders.</p>\n<p>The Daemon-puppets committed this murder in their usual way. They flew up to the roof and waited before climbing down the chimney on a thread. The thread is still there.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Friede was not alone, Pumpf decided to go back up and cause a distraction by banging on the front door.</p>\n<p>She had to stop and fly off a couple of times because of passers-by.</p>\n<p>Once they had the couple separated, the two puppets cornered Friede and pinned her to the floor. Dappz then cast Treason of Tzeentch and they interrogated her about her greed and ambition which Br&ouml;gue so resented. They were able to find out where she hid her cache and dispatched her by shoving coins down her throat.</p>\n<p>They were such quick workers that they were able to sew all the coins into her flesh while Gunther was working out how to get back into the loft room.</p>\n<h3>Gunther Schlypper</h3>\n<p>Gunther is in shock, and staying with his brother nearby, but will speak to the Characters. He is a clerk with a local boat firm and has no skill with a cobbler&rsquo;s needle. He can confirm what Zahndahl might have already told the Characters.</p>\n<p>The knocking was steady and deliberate. A seemingly incessant noise made not by a fist, but perhaps a cane (in fact, it was made by Pumpf &rsquo;s head). He remembers that the banging did stop a couple of times for a few moments, but then continued in the same monotonous pattern.</p>\n<p>He cannot think of a single reason why anyone would have wanted to harm Friede. He knew the other victims and they all seemed decent and upstanding. As far as he is concerned there was no animosity at all between Friede and Bl&uuml;cher.</p>"}

Their patron looks like he will be the murderer&rsquo;s next victim. So every day they keep him alive they are paid a bonus.</p>\n<p>The three victims in what must be connected killings are all esteemed members of Altdorf&rsquo;s Cobblers&rsquo; Guild. Now only one master cobbler remains alive, Ernst Bl&uuml;cher, and he is very worried.</p>\n<p>Shocked by the murders, and the emerging pattern, Burgomeister Maler and the Town Council have dispatched&nbsp;one of their agents, Gertrude Zahndahl, to try to solve the issue.</p>\n<p>This has not exactly put Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s mind at rest, as Zahndahl&rsquo;s investigative powers leave much to be desired.</p>\n<p>Therefore, with Bl&uuml;cher certain an attempt on his life is imminent, he has insisted Zahndahl gets proper investigators on the case. Zahndahl, of course, decides to recruit the Characters.</p>\n<h3>Br&ouml;gue the Shoemaker</h3>\n<p>Eight years ago, Piotr Br&ouml;gue was a master cobbler in Altdorf.</p>\n<p>He had a prosperous workshop on Luitpoldstrasse. His quality shoemaking was in demand, so much so that he was rushed off his feet trying to fulfil orders. One night when he was in despair of making a pair of shoes for an important customer on time, he was visited by three little stick-like creatures who offered to do the work for him. This was a bit odd, but Br&ouml;gue was desperate to fulfil his obligation to his customer and thought it was worth giving them a try.</p>\n<p>In the morning, after a much-needed good night&rsquo;s rest, he was met by the sight of a wonderful new pair of shoes sitting on his workshop bench. Later that day while rushing to get another pair of shoes ready, the three figures appeared to him again and offered to finish those shoes. Satisfied already with their workmanship, Br&ouml;gue agreed.</p>\n<p>And sure enough, in the morning, he came down to find another pair of shoes ready for his customer. These were just as wellmade as the first pair. Soon Br&ouml;gue was working on another pair of shoes and who should appear but the three stick-like figures&hellip;</p>\n<p>At the end of the week, Br&ouml;gue had eight pairs of shoes of excellent quality, eight satisfied customers, and his backlog of work had been cleared. He was finding himself strangely comfortable with his new little friends.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, over the coming days, the eight satisfied customers disappeared almost without trace, leaving only their shoes behind. Br&ouml;gue knew, deep down, that his shoes had been responsible for the disappearances, eating their wearers from the feet up.</p>\n<p>His strange behaviour, his frantic denials, and the remaining shoes provided enough evidence for the other members of the Cobblers&rsquo; Guild to grow suspicious. He was confronted by his erstwhile friends and colleagues. They had no proof, and the crimes seemed so bizarre that they were hard to take seriously, but Br&ouml;gue decided to leave town before the authorities became involved.</p>\n<p>As it happened, these events were hushed up and were largely forgotten in Ubersreik. Although, fairy tales are often told today of the Daemon cobblers and the shoes that ate their wearers.</p>\n<h3>On the Road</h3>\n<p>As Br&ouml;gue was getting ready to leave, the three stick-figures asked if they could go with him, and he readily agreed. Although they were makers of murderous shoes and unfathomable beings of magic, they were his friends, and the four of them seemed to make a good team.</p>\n<p>He fell in with a travelling fair, and realised that a marionette show would be an excellent cover for an itinerant craftsman and his three little daemonic stick-figure friends. He and the Daemons crafted genuine marionettes to play as support characters to the real stars of the show. The show was a hit with customers who were amazed that Br&ouml;gue could control so many puppets at once.</p>\n<p>Soon he could earn enough to live comfortably on the road. After a while the company had enough to buy a mule and cart and build themselves an impressive mobile theatre.</p>\n<p>However, the Daemons needed to be sustained by blood sacrifice. They could not go for much longer than a few months without murdering and feasting on the blood of a fresh victim. Life in the travelling fair gave them good opportunities for obtaining victims whose deaths didn&rsquo;t attract too much attention.</p>\n<p>Over the years Br&ouml;gue has been careful not to stay with a single fair for too long. That way his companions&rsquo; murderous movements could not be traced and he would not arouse the suspicions of his fellow travellers. Fairs are usually happy to have a new act join them, bringing more variety to their pitches.</p>\n<p>He was usually seen merely as a harmless eccentric, who kept himself to himself, and had a tendency to talk to his puppets.</p>\n<p>For the next eight years, in the company of a dozen different fairs, Br&ouml;gue and his Daemons travelled the length and breadth of the Empire. Until a few days ago when they found themselves in Ubersreik once more.</p>\n<h3>Return to Altdorf</h3>\n<p>Br&ouml;gue had put the circumstances of his leaving Ubersreik out of his mind, but now those memories came flooding back, entirely corrupted by his new outlook on life. He has decided that he was driven out unfairly and that he must get revenge on all his erstwhile fellow master cobblers.</p>\n<p>In his mind, Belinda Boecks, who he had been good friends with and who had been most sympathetic to his plight, became a wanton who sought revenge after he scorned her. Dieter Schlingbach, friendly and garrulous, became a malicious gossip who turned people against him behind his back.</p>\n<p>Friede Schlypper, the guildmaster, and wealthiest of the guild members, became a miser who wanted him gone so she could steal his business. And Ernst Bl&uuml;cher, a skilful worker, became an incompetent who was jealous of Br&ouml;gue&rsquo;s skill.</p>\n<h3>Br&ouml;gue</h3>\n<p>Br&ouml;gue appears as an old man, but he is not as old as he looks. He wears a black hooded cloak, black trousers, and very well-made expensive shoes. The cloak is to keep him hidden during performances, but he feels more comfortable wearing it all the time, usually with the hood up. Beneath the cowl his face is gaunt and his straggly hair is greying. His posture has improved no end, now that he is standing upright and his arms are toned from holding up the puppets.</p>\n<h3>The Daemons</h3>\n<p>The Daemons call themselves Pumpf, Dappz, and Schn&auml;ker, though their true names are no doubt something far more esoteric. They are all roughly a foot in height, and are light, thin, and seemingly fragile like dry twigs. In fact, they are much more resilient than they feel. At will they can become as stiff as a wooden toy, behaving just like a marionette, and betray no sign of their nature, except through magical detection. They are all gaudily coloured as if painted by an artist with no taste or sense of complementary colours. All three Daemons carry sharp needles and magical spools of unending thread. (Note: The Daemons feet are left bare. They can&rsquo;t abide having anything on their feet.) Witnessing the Daemons when they are not in their marionette state counts as a Minor Corrupting Influence.</p>"}

Her influence over her father would be considerable (3 votes), if she only knew.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Getting close to Katarina is difficult. She lives in the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{palace} with her chaperone. At certain Carnival events it may be possible to find her without her chaperone. Rallane Lafarel the Minstrel might be able to introduce a respectable Character at one of his famous parties. In public and in the Palace, 20 Knights Panther are never far away from her. Failing an introduction from another NPC, a solid pretext will be needed to meet her at any social event. Characters of high social status might make a formal social visit; otherwise, something flamboyant will be necessary.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: –5 to all Fellowship Tests. Katarina has taken on her chaperone's dislike for Dwarfs, though she has begun to question it.</p>\n<p><strong>Elves</strong>: +5 to all Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Although Katarina knows little of direct relevance, she is the most powerful single powerful influence on the Graf, whom the PCs can recruit to their cause. She can get the Characters access to the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{Inner Palace} and, at least in theory, she can summon almost any NPC at fairly short notice — though she will refuse to let the  take too much advantage of her. Well-judged role-playing will be needed to win her over: to be seen to wield influence over politics with strangers to Middenheim is no business for a Princess!</p>\n<p>Tall, handsome male Characters will have to work harder with Katarina than they expect. She demands attention, poetry, serenades, thoughtful and lavish presents, and other romantic gestures; mention of political favours will introduce an unwelcome and slightly sordid note to the courtship. She has powerful influence with the Graf, but the Characters must work hard to win it and to keep it.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Katarina has no misconceptions, but only because she knows nothing of politics. She knows she can get her own way with the Graf, but does not connect this with political influence.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Katarina takes no interest in the tax changes, but she is unhappy that the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{temple of Shallya} — one of her charities — will have to spend funds on the taxes that would otherwise go to help the sick and needy. She hopes to discuss this with her half-brother @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich} before eventually tackling Graf Boris about it.</p>\n<p>Getting a ‘fine, upstanding husband’ is a major goal. Katarina longs to be wooed, like a princess in a fairytale, but her suitors so far have not impressed her. Plausible candidates must be Human, noble, tall, cultured, and handsome. A high Fellowship score and impressive social skills are an absolute must. The Princess requires dramatic (but not vulgar) protestations of undying affection, expensive and aesthetically delightful gifts, and serenades on a warm, moonlit night from the best minstrels.</p>\n<p>Even if none of the Characters is a credible suitor, Katarina may still become infatuated with one of them. Serious attempts to win her heart will almost certainly lead to marriage or incarceration, depending on the Character’s social standing: either way, the character is effectively removed from the campaign. Such an act would also arouse the undying hatred of the chaperone, if she finds out.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: A dusty and tedious old man.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Admires his strength, kindly nature, and courteous manner, as well as his fondness for music. Of course, he is of rather lowly origins, and engaged to someone else.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Likes him and enjoys hearing him play. Laughingly scolds him for his impressions of other court figures, but senses that he is lonely at times.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: Fond of her, but increasingly annoyed at being treated like a child. Katarina increasingly wants the freedom to live her life unsupervised.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: More boring old men.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Has no dealings with them, but she is somewhat awed by magic.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Likes him for his kindly demeanour, charitable nature, and his excellent manners. Knows nothing of his affair with Emmanuelle Schlagen, and would be shocked to learn of it.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ybdS4Z0pbWL8oiND]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: She is haughty and condescending to them, and occasionally spiteful. She knows that her father is having an affair with one of them, but not which one. In a bad mood, she might go so far as to label them ‘strumpets.’</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Thinks him a ‘ninny’, and loves @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane’s} satirical impersonations of him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Has few dealings with him, but likes his gracefulness and good manners — she can see that he is natural and unaffected. She also likes him for being the friend of Rallane the Minstrel.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Who?</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: She is fascinated but horrified by this daring, exciting, amusing, and rather shocking fellow. She can see that he truly cares about Baron Stefan and is clearly helping him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: More dusty old clerks. Let’s talk about someone more interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Thinks Breugal should relax a little, but unconsciously senses the affection he harbours for her and finds him endearing, like an eccentric uncle.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Katarina has no interest in or knowledge of the Cult of Verena.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>Katarina looks up to Begegnen. She knows that the priestess is a selfless soul who makes great sacrifices for the unfortunate people of Middenheim. Katarina has spoken with her father on behalf of the temple because Isolde is one of the few people who doesn’t treat her like she’s stupid.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, <em>@JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{A Knight’s Midsummer Dream}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Dwavern Valley Choirs}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}, </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Elven Lightsingers}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants and Jousting}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 1)}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 2)}</em></p>\n<h3>Katarina at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>‘Princess’ Katarina is very difficult to meet or have an opportunity for a chance encounter. She is escorted in public by a large contingent of Knights Panther and guarded in private by her @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Chaperone}.  If the Characters have befriended @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} the Minstrel, he may invite them to a small, private party, which the ‘Princess’ might attend for a half-hour or so. If Rallane likes a good-looking and cultured Character, he strives to distract the Chaperone’s attention for five minutes to facilitate a conversation. The Character had better have some good lines ready or be a great raconteur! Katarina is easily distracted, but responds well to stimulating conversation or intriguing gossip. </p>\n<p>Some players might think that the best place to approach Katarina is at the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}, but this is not so. The event is formal, and she knows that many eyes are on her; she is introduced to so many people that no one individual really has a chance to make an impression; and there is no opportunity for a private conversation. The best opportunities are at the @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets} and the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}, especially if @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} and her other friends can distract @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde} the Chaperone for a few minutes. Katarina’s visit to the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya} on Backertag to engage in some solitary reflection may also provide an opening.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Katarina won’t introduce anyone to her father, because he is unwell, and should not be disturbed. Likewise, the Characters cannot use her to see @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan}, because @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} has given strict instructions that he should avoid all excitement. If the Characters convince her that they can help her brother, she introduces them to Pavarotti so that he can make the decision. She can introduce the Characters to @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}, especially fellow Elves, and may provide an introduction to @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}. An introduction to @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} is tricky: while Katarina has considerable affection for her chaperone — coupled with a healthy dose of frustration, of course — and would normally be happy to help anyone respectable to make her acquaintance, she worries that taking younger, handsome, and especially male characters to see the chaperone could lead to uncomfortable questions about how they met, and why Hildegarde is only learning about their acquaintance now.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/katarina-todbringer.webp","folder":"YbdT1wAfqZmWtR79","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}

But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a difficult process, especially if you follow these tips, and review the example Motivations presentated below.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth stressing that the most interesting Characters are those whose Motivations run contrary to what you would normally expect. Everyone expects a mercenary to care about &lsquo;Wealth&rsquo;, but what if they actually care about &lsquo;Duty&rsquo; to their family, and are sending all their money back home? Everyone expects a Scholar to care about &lsquo;Knowledge&rsquo;, but what if they are motivated more by &lsquo;Romance&rsquo; than anything else? A good rule of thumb when it comes to writing is to throw out your first idea because it&rsquo;s the obvious one, and the same often applies to a Character&rsquo;s Motivation.</p>\n<p>Also, keep in mind that your Motivation isn&rsquo;t locked in stone, it can change whenever you need it to.</p>\n<h3>Changing Motivations</h3>\n<p>A Character&rsquo;s Motivations are sure to change throughout the course of their adventuring life, and Players and GMs should always be vigilant for when this occurs. Whilst Motivation can be changed at the beginning of every session, it&rsquo;s a good idea to save these changes for the following moments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you find yourself having not played to your Character&rsquo;s Motivation in a few sessions</li>\n<li>When you change Career</li>\n<li>When you complete an Ambition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Players should use these events to express how their Character has changed, and are encouraged to show off their new Motivation in the coming session. You should award an additional Resolve Point if this change is roleplayed in a believable and dramatic fashion!</p>\n<h3>The 'Check-In'</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, during an intense scene or Combat, it&rsquo;s difficult to keep track of Motivations, and whether or not they trigger @JournalEntry[Fate and Resilience]{Resolve}. If you&rsquo;re finding your group forgets about Motivation often, or if you&rsquo;d rather not worry about it during a session, try using a Check-In instead.</p>\n<p>A Check-In occurs at the same time as handing out XP, and involves everyone going around the table and announcing their Motivation. Next, everyone considers the session they&rsquo;ve just played, and decides if that Character expressed their Motivation &lsquo;not at all&rsquo;, &lsquo;a bit&rsquo; or &lsquo;a lot&rsquo;. Everyone should get a say, and should take this opportunity to point out interesting and humorous moments during the session, but ultimately the Player and the GM together have the final say over how much the Motivation was expressed. This is purely subjective, so go more along how it felt, rather than a point-for-point retelling of the session.</p>\n<p>If a Character expressed their Motivation &lsquo;not at all&rsquo;, they regain no Resolve. If they expressed it &lsquo;a bit&rsquo;, they regain 1 Resolve Point, or 2 Resolve for &lsquo;a lot&rsquo;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Ruinous Motivations</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some Motivations are, themselves, the pathways of the damned. Whilst some are clearly corrupting like &lsquo;Debauchery&rsquo; or &lsquo;Violence&rsquo;, even seemingly innocent Motivations can and do stoke the fire of Chaos within a Character. &lsquo;Change&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hope&rsquo; are admirable Motivations, though they do undeniably play into the machinations of Tzeentch and Nurgle respectively.</em></p>\n<p><em>You may offer a Player an additional Resolve Point for following the Character&rsquo;s Motivation in exchange for a Corruption Point if the action appears to aid one or more of the Ruinous Powers. This choice is always the Player&rsquo;s to make.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Example Motivations</h3>\n<p>The following is a list of example Motivations accompanied by situations which might earn them Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Authority</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a clear chain of command, and thrive when there are orders to be followed &mdash; whether you&rsquo;re giving them, or taking them. Most people who favour such structure either long for the day when they themselves are able to pass commands down the chain to their lessers, or believe themselves to be merely a cog in a greater machine. Following orders or listening to, and assisting, the authorities garners Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Change</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need for change, for a better or brighter future. You are discontent with the status quo, and any action you take that shifts this &mdash; whether positively or negatively &mdash; is better than what we have now, at least. Anything you do that is counter to the norm feeds into this Motivation.</p>\n<h4>Charity</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to help people. Whilst many give to charity in pursuit of power, status, or out of boredom, you do it for its own sake. Charity, in your eyes, is its own reward. Helping the less fortunate, and giving what you can, regenerates your Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Control</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a desire to control the world around you. Perhaps you suffer from anxiety, or were raised in a situation where you were the centre of attention &mdash; whatever the reason, you thrive when there are no surprises. You regain Resolve when you seek to bend the world around you to your will.</p>\n<h4>Debauchery</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by forbidden delights. Either the fact that they are forbidden is tantilising to you, or you&rsquo;ve lost sight of healthy appetites long ago, you regain Resolve when you give into your obscene desires.</p>\n<h4>Envy</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to possess that which others have. It could be anything &mdash; wealth, romance, land, power &mdash; but you desire these things because someone else has them, not for their own merit. When you covet and take from others, you are sure to regenerate Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Faith (God)</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a deep faith in your patron God of choice, and allow the strictures of such to dictate your life. Choose a God to go along with this Motivation, and regain Resolve whenever you go out of your way to follow that God&rsquo;s strictures, or protect the honour and sanctity of their worship. A list of Gods and their strictures can be found in @JournalEntry[The Gods] Fame</p>\n<p>You are motivated by being known. You want your name to be on everyone&rsquo;s lips, to be well regarded, and to be remembered. When you perform actions in public, or work to spread word of your deeds (real or imaginary), you recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Freedom</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by being untethered and allowed to go where you please. Often freed bondsmen, enslaved individuals, or the children of overly oppressive parents burn with this Motivation. You recover Resolve when you choose your own path in the face of authority.</p>\n<h4>Glory</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to achieve great things. You likely have one burning desire &mdash; perhaps your Long Term Ambition &mdash; which, whenever you work towards it, you recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Gluttony</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by an unnatural appetite for something specific, and wish to indulge that vice at all times. When you pursue or partake of your vice, you feed your Motivation and regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Hope</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a hope that things can get better. In the Old World, this is a futile Motivation, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop thousands of souls trudging towards it every day. When you perform actions that seem doomed to fail, but you do them anyway because you believe it might work out, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Infamy</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a desire to be remembered and feared. Like fame, infamy is about developing a personal story that will always be bigger than the person you were, but it differs in that you don&rsquo;t want to be remembered kindly. You want to forever serve as a lesson to someone or against something, and whenever you strike fear, or encourage rumours about yourself, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Justice</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to see justice done. Whether it&rsquo;s a belief that justice holds together society, or a perverse fascination with punishment, you see enacting the law of the Gods &mdash; though not necessarily the law of the land &mdash; as paramount. Whenever you aid or enact your own justice, regenerate Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Knowledge</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the search for knowledge itself. You don&rsquo;t necessarily want to do anything with that knowledge, but the pursuit is what&rsquo;s important to you. When you learn something new, or encourage the spread of knowledge, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Love</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a strong bond of love with someone. Love is often irrational, and causes people to act in ways which deprioritise their own safety or happiness, and doing so is a sure way of earning Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Obligation</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by an obligation you hold &mdash; to family, friends, an organisation, and so on. You likely have a role to play in relation to this obligation, and fulfilling that role is of paramount importance to you. Whenever you perform actions that fulfill that role, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Order</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by structure and order. You thrive when there is a set framework to operate inside of, and rules to follow. You regain Resolve when you follow the rules &mdash; especially to your detriment &mdash; and help enforce them.</p>\n<h4>Patriotism</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by love of country. This pride can become toxic &mdash; used as a pathetic crutch to cover for your own failings &mdash; or could stem from true pride in the history of your people &mdash; whether deserved or doctored. You recover Resolve by putting your nation first, and by following the dictates of your rulers &mdash; rational or otherwise.</p>\n<h4>Perfection</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to be perfect. Regardless of what the focus is, you need to be the perfect example of it, a painter, a poet, a cook, whatever. This Motivation exists beyond any tangible benefits of that perfection or profession, and often strays into a truly unhealthy mindset, for perfection is ultimately impossible. Whenever you work towards that perfection, regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Pleasure</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the pursuit of pleasure, fine food, fine wine, fine friends, and so forth. You seek to get the most out of life, and feel fulfilled when in good, comfortable, pleasurable company. You regain Resolve whenever you take a little extra effort to bring a little extra pleasure into your life.</p>\n<h4>Power</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a quest for power. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what power, and over whom, but you feel safer and more whole when the power of any situation is in your hands. This may translate into literal power &mdash; the search for arcane potency or martial excellence &mdash; but not necessarily. You just have to exert and extend your reach to recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Respect</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the respect of your peers. It&rsquo;s not necessarily about being the best &mdash; the best swordsman, the best incantor, the best alchemist &mdash; but you need your peers to heed what you say, and admire your works. You may see yourself as&nbsp;</p>\n<p>first among equals, or merely rising to the level of your heroes, but either way, when you increase or maintain your standing, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Revenge</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need for revenge. Perhaps someone killed your father and they must prepare to die, or someone ruined your family&rsquo;s business and now you seek to destroy theirs. Whatever the source of your ire, you seek to reenact it on those who hurt you. Whenever you work towards or fulfill your revenge, recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Ruin</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the ruination of the world around you. You may have a target in mind, a specific nation, family, or organisation, or merely existence itself. Whenever you work to bring your foes to their knees and have them crushed under your boot, you regenerate Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Servitude</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by your service to another. Servitude is a rare Motivation, because it relies on the mind placing the needs of another above one&rsquo;s own, and trusting in the benevolence of that master. When you act at the behest of those you serve, you recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Survival</h4>\n<p>You are motivated first and foremost by your own survival, and will do what you can to protect yourself. This Motivation extends to protecting your livelihood, if it comes under existential threat &mdash; a hunter defending their hunting grounds from poachers, or an urchin protecting their streets from invading troops. In any situation where you take an active hand to maintain your survival, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Unity</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by uniting others towards a common goal. Whether this stems from dreams of Empire, Shallyan pacifism, or a desire to mend an old feud, you regain Resolve when you act to bring others together.</p>\n<h4>Wealth</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the clink of coins. Whilst almost everyone is motivated in some way by money in the Old World, you desire money for its own sake. You may even be loath to spend it once it is yours. Wealth, for you, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean power or privilege, but it represents a dependable source of strength for yourself. Whenever you seek out wealth and hoard it, regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Violence</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by violence, and love the thrill of battle. You might be addicted to the adrenaline, or you&rsquo;re fascinated by the craft of battle. Whatever the case, whenever you engage in violent acts for their own purpose, regenerate Resolve.</p>","folder":"5lgcrfb3I58JxD8Y","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"}}}

{"_id":"Y2Tz145Dqgfl1Chf","name":"For Grognards","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">The Villain</h2>\n<p>Veteran players already know that Wasmeier is the villain of the piece, so you might decide to challenge them by using another of the major NPCs instead. Here are some possibilities.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE CHANCELLOR</h3>\n<p>The Purple Hand has long been working to place agents in positions of influence, and the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} is one of the most powerful people in Middenheim. He might have set up a number of red herrings pointing to the @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Law Lord Wasmeier}, who is actually just what he seems: a studious and hard working public servant who is genuinely opposed to the new taxes. Sparsam’s agents might even have planted certain documents in Wasmeier’s home to incriminate him.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE MINSTREL</h3>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} presents a smiling face to the world, but he may have a darker agenda. In this Dwarf-friendly city, few Elves feel truly at home, and Lafarel’s rise to position and influence were brought about in part through his allegiance to Tzeentch. Sick of the city’s acceptance of Dwarfs, its unlovely architecture, and its lumpish people, he looks forward to bringing the whole place crashing down. He is working with the Purple Hand to make sure that happens. Meanwhile, under the guise of friendly concern, he is visiting the Graf nightly, and playing semi-magical songs that keep his spirits depressed and his senses dulled.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE CHAPERONE</h3>\n<p>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} secretly despises the Graf and his family. She was born into a respectable family with a small amount of noble blood, and taught to look up to her ‘betters’. Yet, she is required to serve a bastard girl — and not the only bastard in the family — and smile upon a master who openly keeps a mistress, even while grieving for his dead wife! All of them disgrace the Todbringer name, and the city they rule is little better. Twisted by bitterness and moral outrage, Hildegarde has decided to bring the whole city crashing down. </p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Hildegarde thinks that the Purple Hand is a secret society devoted to a puritan form of the Ulrican religion, and has no idea of its links to Chaos.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE WIZARDS </h3>\n<p>@Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{High Wizard Helseher} and his deputy, @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}, have been members of the Purple Hand for some time, seduced by a promise of knowledge and advancement. Together they have formulated this plan to turn Middenheim over to their master, placing the blame on the Law Lords — if they are found out. While they publicly oppose the taxes, they plan to use them to rid the city of all spellcasters who are not loyal to the Changer of the Ways.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE LADIES AT COURT</h3>\n<p>Sick of being regarded as mere ornaments to the Graf’s court, one or more of these three ladies at court have thrown in their lot with the Purple Hand. In exchange for the promise of power and influence — and perhaps, even rulership — after the city falls, they are pulling strings, all the while seeming the least likely of threats to the Graf and the city. Power-hungry @Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha} is the most obvious potential villain of the three, but perhaps @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra’s} love of gossip masks a keen political mind. The deep-minded @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten} surely has the intellect to formulate a plan of this complexity. Perhaps all three are acting in concert.</p>\n<p>Whichever villain is chosen, the GM will have to make some adjustments to the locations used in Chapter 6, substituting the chosen villain’s residence for Wasmeier’s house.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">Deadly Secrets</h2>\n<p>Several of the major NPCs have deadly secrets, which the villain is using to manipulate them. Just like the villain’s identity, these secrets can be attached to different NPCs in order to present veteran players with a different challenge.</p>\n<p>An NPC’s behaviour and attitudes may be affected by a deadly secret, and you should amend the NPC descriptions as necessary. To be sure of success, the villain must control NPCs with a total of at least 9 ‘influence votes’ (see ‘@JournalEntry[BGdbAf7b92xpZpfg]{Influencing the Graf}’). Also, it is important that the villain does not control @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}, the Baronial Physician. The Characters  may suspect him at first, but he can become an important ally, and may be the only chance to break the hypnotism that affects @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}. If he were to be controlled by the villain, things would become difficult or even impossible.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{RANALD'S DELIGHT}</h3>\n<p><strong>Currently</strong>: @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor Josef Sparsam}.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives</strong>: @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}, one of the Midden Marshals, High Wizard @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}, High Priest @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} or Law Lord @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Reiner Ehrlich}.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">@Item[vXJq3j6MGR3oThG0]{HYPNOTISM}</h3>\n<p><strong>Currently</strong>: @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives</strong>: Chancellor @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam}, @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’ Katarina Todbringer}, Watch Commander @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann}, @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}, or Law Lord @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Reiner Ehlrich}.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">RELATIVE OF @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{BRUNO KOHL}</h3>\n<p><strong>Currently</strong>: @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich}, the Chaperone (unknown to the villain).</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives</strong>: Chancellor @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} (nephew), one of the Midden Marshals (illegitimate son), @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric} (illegitimate son), @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} (half-brother), @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} (half-brother or former lover), @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Knight Eternal Siegfried Prunkvoll}, (brother), or one of the Law Lords (illegitimate son).</p>\n<p>This change is an excellent way to connect low status Characters to more courtly figures, and thereby to the plot of the adventure. Criminal Characters known or introduced to Bruno Kohl may provide useful agents for the wayward but patriotic Middenheimer. Bruno may have heard of trouble at the court from his relative, assuming they are more accomodating than Hildegarded, and direct the Characters to investigate on his behalf.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">AFFAIR AND BLACKMAIL</h3>\n<p><strong>Currently</strong>: @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} and @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}.</p>\n<p>Almost any pairing will work — so long as there is some scandal to the relationship which a blackmailer could take advantage of. In the case of Emmanuelle, her relationship with @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Boris Todbringer} might prove reason enough, as any rival for his affections could be at risk of punishment. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE DOPPELGÄNGER</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the shapechanger impersonating the murdered Law Lord is not a Doppelgänger, but some other kind of creature that presents the Characters with a completely different kind of challenge — especially if they are expecting a Doppelgänger. There are some options presented on this journal: a creative GM will be able to think of more.</p>","folder":"WdnGu3bWeo44Lk4e","sort":50000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 3: The Evil Plot","sort":50000}}}

The largest are the Helmsweg, Hugeldal, von Voglemann, and Magnus. Helmsweg is considered the &lsquo;luckiest&rsquo; as it has never been breached. Hugeldal is leaning precariously, though most Dwarfs snort if any dare suggest it may topple. The imposing von Voglemann tower boasts heavy walls and multiple cannon, but can only be reached by a special lift, making duties there a mixed blessing.

{"_id":"YPpM7Pg44EgT2yt5","name":"The Carnival","content":"<p>After the Characters have had a couple of days to explore, and familiarise themselves with the City of the White Wolf, and begin their investigation, Carnival week begins. Considered by many as the highlight of the year, people flock to Middenheim’s Carnival from all corners of The Empire.  Visitors from further afield are a common sight: gaudy aristocrats from Bretonnia; swarthy merchants from Estalia; laconic, hard-drinking Norsemen; and business-minded Wastelanders. During Carnival Week, Middenheim’s population swells by 5,000 or more.</p>\n<p>The Carnival forms the backdrop to this adventure, and you  should keep it constantly in mind. Inns are packed to capacity, people from far and wide crowd the streets, and there is an almost tangible excitement in the air.</p>\n<p>During the Carnival, the normally dour Middenheimers forget their troubles. Jesting, irreverence, intoxication, informality, friendliness to strangers — this is part and parcel of the week. The Carnival spirit is evident in most minor NPC encounters. The atmosphere is intoxicating: the streets are crowded with vendors crying their wares, buskers and street poets performing for coins; the chatter, shoving, and occasional arguments of an ocean of people. The senses are assaulted by noise and bustle; the smell of ale and food hangs heavy in the air. All day and all night, the streets are thronged with people having loud, boisterous fun.</p>\n<p>The locals are very friendly during Carnival week, and outsiders are treated as equals — a marked contrast to the normal attitude. This feeling of camaraderie may help the Characters to feel that they have a stake in the city’s well-being, and that there is nothing to stop them investigating the mystery of the new taxes. When the week-long party ends, though, the Middenheimers will revert back to their normal, pragmatic, no-nonsense selves. By then, one way or the other, the Characters’ job will be over, but the players do not know that.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Many Middenheimers claim that the Carnival is as old as the city. In their version, it was Artur himself — chief of the Teutognens and founder of Middenheim — who declared,<em> ‘Long has been our wandering and long our suffering. This place will be our home — so let’s party!’</em></p>\n<p>Like most neat and pleasing legends, this is complete hogwash. The first Carnival was held in 1812 IC to celebrate the ending of a Middenlander siege. Middenheim had been cut off for over nine months, and was saved only by Dwarf allies, who held off the attackers and prolonged the siege until the onset of winter. As the cold set in, the besieging army was forced to retire, and the Middenheimers were able to celebrate. Unfortunately, foodstuffs were running low, and much of the cuisine consisted of rats and other unpalatables. Everything was heavily smoked or salted to disguise its taste, and to this day the event is commemorated as the ‘1812 Over-Cure.’</p>\n<p>In the following years, the celebration attracted few visitors, since travelling through the snows of winter was not an appealing prospect. Since more visitors meant more money, the city decided to change the date of the Carnival to springtime — sure enough, more people arrived. In the following year, it was suggested (perhaps sarcastically) that the date of the Carnival be moved to the summer.</p>\n<p>This was deemed an even better idea.  A great tradition was started: the Middenheim Carnival now follows a four-yearly cycle through the seasons. Once every four years, at the Winter Carnival, the city has — in effect — its own private celebrations, with few visitors. At other times, though, the city opens its gates wide for anyone and everyone to join in the festivities.</p>\n<p>Of course, like all good tales, there is another version. Cynics argue that the time of the Carnival changes in order to capitalise on those who get the date wrong, and arrive a season too early (or late). Having travelled many miles to have a good time, they are determined to do so, and spend money in any case.</p>\n<p>The lack of dates in the previous paragraphs is deliberate. Whatever time of year the Characters arrive in Middenheim, the Carnival should be about to start.</p>\n<h3>The Fast</h3>\n<p>Carnival is always preceded by a fast on the day before the festivities begin. The fast is not a religious obligation, but traditionally, Middenheimers eat only the kinds of food that were available to their forebears at the end of the siege; most decide to fast for a day in preparation for over indulgence in all forms of earthly delights in the following week.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/streets.webp\" width=\"629\" height=\"339\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-challenge.webp","folder":"lUyL3SvOXg2BFpv2","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 5: The Carnival","sort":100000}}}

At all times Parzival displays the classic symptoms of the noble born: he is rich, vain, arrogant, and tediously chauvinistic.</p>\n<p>Parzival was a staunch supporter of the Jungfreuds, and was forced to flee Ubersreik when they were driven from power. A customer of Rocheteau’s, he was promised a hiding place 'at the head of a respectable military force' in the village. He has spent almost a year in Pritzstock, quietly seething at the indignity of it all, but has spent some time training the small militia in weapon drills and defensive strategy all the same. He has spent much more time courting Isolde Gudhoffen.</p>\n<p>Parzival views the skull attacks as a gift from the gods, a chance for a Reikland noble to show some Bretonnians how to get things done. Unfortunately, the skulls have not played fair and he has not even seen one. He hungers for distraction, and greets any plan to go skull-hunting with enthusiasm. He is not without some sense, however, and will cooperate with any plan that looks like it will yield results, providing he has a prominent part to play. Despite his annoying personality, the Characters would do well to get him on their side.</p>\n<p>The militia under his command consists of Josef Bleuler, Manfred Fleiss, Hans-Friedrich Kallman, and Gunter Semmelweiss.</p>","folder":"yB7s0OOrS3UGCVZv","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"Yb6ew66hdbL4vBT3","name":"The Gravelord Responds","content":"<p>The first night the Characters spend in the village, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber}  mounts an attack on the Rocheteaus’ house — or, if it has been destroyed by an overzealous party looking for a walled-up body, wherever the couple is spending the night.</p>\n<p>At about two in the morning, lights are seen flitting through the woods to the north of the village. Four skulls are flying toward @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}, about fifteen feet off the ground, each holding a blazing torch in its jaws. They have been ordered to fly to the burgomeister’s house and drop their torches on to its thatched roof. As the occupants flee the burning building, the skulls will swoop down to attack @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet} and @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe}, two skulls to each NPC, ignoring everyone else.</p>\n<p>Anyone trying to shoot or cast spells at the skulls as they approach suffers a –20 penalty for a Little target. The normal –30 penalty for shooting in darkness is offset by the light of the torches that clearly marks the position of each skull.</p>\n<p>If the Characters (perhaps aided by the militia) repulse the skulls, they do not return until the next day. If any skulls are captured or destroyed, it is clear that each has a slogan scrawled across its forehead in charcoal. Two examples are in the box below, and feel free to invent more.</p>\n<p>Further attacks are up to the GM. @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} has a stock of forty skulls in the cave, and can enchant up to four at a time. His objective is to kill Elisabet Rocheteau (and her husband too, if possible), but the GM can extend the adventure by giving him additional goals.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: A LITTLE MORE URGENCY</em></h3>\n<p><em>Players who are familiar with the original version of ‘The Grapes of Wrath’ for the earlier editions of WFRP may be expecting to have a week or so to deal with escalating attacks before the climax of the adventure. In this version, the timescale is rather shorter. This is for two reasons.</em></p>\n<p><em>Firstly, the Characters are probably on their way to Middenheim to begin <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. They have an urgent package to deliver, so time is of the essence.</em></p>\n<p><em>Second, Gräber has been keeping an eye on the village, and he is dismayed to see the Characters arrive: the very same people who were keeping company with @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.bUxA8zyayMarTXP7]{Father Marcus} and the monks whom he punished earlier (see @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.wIbYy6PUBKFdJvPF]{‘Vengeance of the Gravelord’}). Being an incurable egotist, Gräber has decided that the Characters have somehow tracked him to @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}, and he is determined to complete his revenge on the village and its inhabitants — especially @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau} — before they can interfere.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">FEAR THE GRAVELORD</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">This title is familiar to the Characters if they have played @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.wIbYy6PUBKFdJvPF]{Vengeance of the Gravelord}, and should motivate them to hunt down this elusive foe.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">INCONSTANT JADE</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">This refers to @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau} and her laughing rejection of Hans Gräber. Either she or Henri-Phillippe recognise the phrase, which Gräber spat at her before quitting the village in humiliation; other villagers (except Seel Baldurich and @Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder Lechart}, who know nothing) require a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Intelligence</strong> Test to recall it. Everyone except Mathilda Reuter is reluctant to speak of the incident unless the Characters make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> or other Test as determined by the GM. If persuaded, they tell the story of Hans Gräber’s visit as given in @JournalEntry[u0jibG3CVNoLK6GT]{The Story}. This gives the Characters a name and a physical description of their opponent, and should motivate them to track him down.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Vengeance Completed</h3>\n<p>For a short, simple adventure, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} considers his vengeance complete when @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau} is dead, but if the Characters are close to finding him, he may be satisfied with leaving her seriously injured.</p>\n<p>To prolong the action, and give the Characters further opportunities to capture a skull or find @Scene[gxjWgssIvXIUd2D7]{Gräber’s lair}, he could have a more extensive revenge in mind. At the GM’s option, additional goals might include some or all of the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Elisabet Rocheteau must die!</em> Gräber will not cease his attacks while she lives.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>Elisabet Rocheteau must pay!</em> After the attack on the Rocheteaus’ house, a skull flies over the village, high and fast, dropping a streamer tied to a small stone (for even more fun, the GM might decide that this is a small piece of warpstone from the cave). Attached to the streamer is a note that reads, <em>‘Save your village. Surrender Elisabet Rocheteau. Alone, where the woman saw the skull. One hour after dusk. Tonight. No more warnings. –The Gravelord.’</em> See <strong>The Trap</strong> below.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>Pritzstock must be destroyed! </em>Starting with the Rocheteaus’ house, Gräber sends wave upon wave of skulls to burn every house in the village. Every hour or so, four more come out of the woods, and the Characters must choose whether to aid the villagers in fighting the resulting fires, destroying the skulls, or following them back to their master. Gräber launches each attack from a different location, so the skulls come from a different direction every time; he does not stop the attacks until he is found, or he runs out of skulls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Trap</h3>\n<p>@Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Henri-Phillippe} refuses the Gravelord’s ultimatum, but the party may be able to persuade him to let them use Elisabet as bait in a trap, if she also agrees to the plan. If not, some substitute might be used, such as Erietta Surhardt (if she is back on her feet) or a Character in disguise.</p>\n<p>If persuading a villager to act as a decoy, the Characters should stress that they will be nearby every step of the way, and they must previously have shown that they are capable of dealing with the skulls.</p>\n<h4>A Fate Worse Than…?</h4>\n<p>Gräber has not decided what to do with @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet} if she is delivered to him. He is torn between visiting some terrible necromantic punishment on her or launching into an impassioned appeal. In his twisted mind, the havoc he has wrought is a sign of his love, and surely no one who would do so much to win a woman’s heart could ever be refused. For want of anything more definite, he has decided to make up his mind once he has seen Elisabet’s initial reaction to him.</p>\n<h4>The Watchers in the Trees</h4>\n<p>However confused he might be in matters of the heart, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} has not overlooked the possibility that @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet} will not come alone as ordered, and that the Characters or someone else will try to turn the rendezvous into an ambush. Accordingly, he established himself at the rendezvous point before sending his demand, and has four skulls watching the area.</p>\n<p>The skulls are half-hidden in the trees, requiring a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test to spot on account of their small size and the covering foliage. The Characters cannot come within a hundred yards of the appointed spot without crossing the field of vision of one of the watching skulls, but since he can only see through the eyes of one skull at a time, there is only a @Roll[1d100]{25%} chance of being spotted on their approach. After that, the Characters are only spotted if they are not attempting to hide, or if they fail a Stealth Test when shifting their position: this is opposed by @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} Perception of 46, although he suffers a –10 penalty because he can only see from the skulls’ viewpoint, and not hear.</p>\n<p>If Gräber sees any sign that @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet} is not alone, or that there is a decoy in her place, he orders the four skulls to swoop down from the trees, attacking Elisabet or her decoy once each in passing before forming into a line and heading off through the trees (away from @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} position) at maximum speed. Under cover of this distraction, he quietly withdraws into the woods, heading back to the cave. Once there, he orders any surviving skulls to return to him by a roundabout route.</p>","folder":"O0HfGcMmqK25GSdm","sort":606250,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":606250}}}

Because Sigmar was once the emperor, his worship is inextricably interwoven with politics, and three of the cult’s highest-ranking members are directly involved with electing new emperors. According to legend, 2,500 years ago Sigmar’s birth was heralded by a twin-tailed comet, and he was born the first son of the chief of the Unberogen tribe. When older, he received the magical warhammer Ghal-maraz (‘Skull-splitter’) as a gift from the Dwarf king Kurgan Ironbeard for saving his life from Greenskins. Sigmar later allied with the Dwarfs and their combined forces defeated the Greenskins. He was then crowned as the first emperor of the Human tribes he’d united. After fifty years of extraordinary rule, Sigmar mysteriously vanished, only to later ascend to divinity, crowned as a god by Ulric, Sigmar’s patron in life.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Most folk of the Empire pay at least lip-service to their patron deity. In the most devout provinces, like Reikland, Sigmar worship is an unquestioned part of daily life. Folk attend weekly ‘throngs’ where the lessons of Sigmar are preached. Many also attend temple to train as local militia, confess sins and purify the soul, or receive advice on how to be more like the God-King of old.&nbsp; Sigmar’s cult is comprised of an uncounted number of different orders. The largest is the Order of the Torch: Sigmar’s priests who lead their local communities. Other orders of importance include: the Order of the Cleansing Flame, comprised of inquisitors and witch hunters; the Order of the Silver Hammer, which includes warrior priests and yet more witch hunters; and the Order of the Anvil, a monastic order concerned with preserving Sigmar’s deeds and laws. The cult also has many templar orders. The most famous are the proud Knights of Sigmar’s Blood, the fanatical Knights of the Fiery Heart, and the militaristic Knights Griffon. Given the cult is so large, there are many different uniforms, vestments, and robes worn, all of which have different colours, cuts, and accessories according to local tradition and requirement.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Every city, town, and village in the Empire has at least one temple to Sigmar. The Grand Cathedral in Altdorf is staffed by hundreds of priests and lay workers, and guarded by at least two orders of templars; at the other end of the scale, a village chapel may be visited just once every week by a travelling priest, who serves the needs of several small settlements.&nbsp; Shrines can be found in most homes, and wayshrines dot every major highway, mostly marked with hammers or comets.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Sigmarite cultists may be ordered to destroy a cell of Chaos-worshippers, or expose a corrupt official who is secretly in league with the Ruinous Powers or a foreign power. It is also common to be tasked with building, or rebuilding, local communities to better promote unity and strength in the Empire.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><em>Strictures</em></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Obey your orders.</em></li>\n<li><em>Aid Dwarf-folk, never do them harm.</em></li>\n<li><em>Promote the unity of the Empire.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bear true allegiance to the imperial throne.</em></li>\n<li><em>Root out Greenskins, Chaos worshippers, and foul witches without mercy.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Blessing of Hardiness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.KSDrXcieyRc37YI7]{Blessing of Might}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.2WN0muIB2BFd4kBO]{Blessing of Righteousness}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Dk0zjtcANtahntHx]{Beacon of Righteous Virtue}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Ffm7xIlRUWyacvKU]{Heed Not the Witch}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.WgZx3xma6vYGz17e]{Sigmar's Fiery Hammer}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.5fVTY8TSua3trOW8]{Soulfire}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.rjkMzFwN1trbSLL8]{Twin-tailed Comet}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.I8YPP2uRmUKyHEq2]{Vanquish the Unrighteous}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/sigmar.webp","folder":"NkiXlTQtgNkW3FMs","sort":900001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"}}}
{"_id":"YwxzIeGFkIWXvuYv","name":"The Stops (Altdorf to Delberz)","content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">The journey north is an opportunity to set the tone of Middenheim. The weather gets colder, passing travellers get more grim, religious and cultural differences become more obvious, and rumours abound (page 14) as Characters hear of the troubles in the city. This is tempered by excitement about the carnival, though veterans of the Schaffenfest in Enemy in Shadows will no doubt be plagued by recollections of Bögenhafen and the calamity that was, hopefully, narrowly avoided there following that festival.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All of this simply adds to the sense that Middenheim is about to become a fulcrum of great change in the Empire — which, one way or another, is certain to be true.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Coach and Horses Inn (Enemy in Shadows, page 11) can be used as a model for any coaching inn along the highway, with alterations to the layout at your discretion. Its staff can be made into entirely new characters with just a name change and a few different personality quirks.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Frederheim</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Best known as the home of the Great Hospice of Shallya (which is actually some distance from the village, deep in the quiet of the forest), Frederheim consists of no more than The Dove coaching inn (independent) and a handful of small shops that have grown up to serve its needs and to house a biweekly market for the surrounding farms.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>See Archives of the Empire II</strong></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Kutenholz</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kutenholz is the first stop in Middenland. It has a coaching inn called The Wolf ’s Head and a large shrine to Ulric nearby.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Wolf ’s Head proudly displays the emblem of Castle Rock Coaches. Although its staff does not turn away other lines’ coaches, Castle Rock receives preferential treatment. This treatment includes a few little perks: first pick of rooms, a 10% discount on food and lodging, and one free ‘Welcome to Middenland’ drink upon arrival.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">@JournalEntry[LCcPyEiTgkfDUkH2]{Shrine of the Shining Rock}</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>See Carrion up the Reik, the Empire in Ruins Companion, Empire in Ruins</strong></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Forest Hearth</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This fortified coaching inn stands beside the road with nothing but trackless forest on either side. Its walls are more than 20 ft high, and spiked on top. Beastman attacks on the inn itself are not common, but attacks on coaches have become more common lately, especially to the north of the inn. Four Seasons has made several attempts to take over the inn, since it is the only accommodation between Kutenholz and Bröckel. This location would give them a significant advantage over competing lines.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So far, though, their efforts have been unsuccessful, and the inn remains independently owned and operated.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Bröckel</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is an unremarkable small town, serving as a market for the nearby villages of Kupfengrube and Guthugel. The Bröckel Arms, on the southern edge of the town, is owned by Four Seasons. The passengers of other lines must rely on the smaller but more central Market Inn. Built to accommodate local farmers visiting the monthly market, this inn usually has four or five rooms and a dozen or so dormitory spaces free at other times.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Mittelweg</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Half-Way House is one of the oldest inns on the Altdorf￾Middenheim road. Its wide surrounding wall still bears the scars of attacks from the forces of Chaos two centuries ago.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Named for its position roughly halfway between Altdorf and Middenheim, Mittelweg grew up around the grand House with its distinct turrets, which are now a welcome sight for weary travellers. They stand at each corner, and their two upper levels are equipped with arrow-slits.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Half-Way House is proud of its history and location, and its staff pride themselves on their warm welcome. Every evening they put on a ‘halfway celebration’ for travellers, with a fine (if expensive) meal, freely flowing drink, and souvenirs, including their novelty half-glasses and half-pint mugs. These mugs and glasses appear full-size from one side, but are flat on the other, as if sliced in two vertically. These are normally brought to the table in pairs, with wooden clothes pegs holding the two halves together.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Delberz</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Travellers are often surprised when their coach arrives at Delberz: according to a number of inaccurate maps that are still in circulation, the town and the River Delb are almost 100 miles south-east of their true positions, and much closer to the River Talabec. Some blame the proximity of the Howling Hills for confusing map-makers, while others recall that Graf Boris Todbringer recently sacked his chief cartographer, Gulhein Tobwurst, over other, similar errors in his maps. The town itself is the largest on the highway, with a small but busy river-port.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Great Oak inn, named after a huge and ancient tree that stands in the courtyard, caters to Four Seasons coaches, providing lavish fare for those travelling on and comfortable rooms for those stopping overnight. Most other overnight visitors use The Wheel and Anchor — owned by the town’s Merchants’ Guild, and therefore immune to commercial acquisition — while midday arrivals are greeted by various hawkers and small shops ranged around the town square.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>See 1e Death on the Reik? Shrines of Sigmar</strong></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The House of Ludovic Hanike</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There’s a burnt out townhouse off the main square. Apparently it burnt down a few weeks ago. Someone will tell the story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Ludovic Hanike was the leader of a small cabal of wizards in Delberz around the time of the Great War Against Chaos. When Magnus the Pious called on all wizards to join the new Colleges of Magic, he steadfastly refused to submit to ‘elf magicks’ and his cabal followed suit. He was powerful enough that no one dared compel him by force. One night he decided to try a summoning spell of his own devising. The screams coming from his house kept the whole town awake all night, but none dared go to see what was happening. The next morning the people ventured out to see what had happened and Ludovic and his household had disappeared into the aethyr, never to be seen again. After that, his cabal decided that maybe elf magick wasn’t so bad after all and joined the colleges. The old house was sold to gullible out-of-towners but after a spate of disappearances it was decided to leave the house empty. It stayed that way until it mysteriously burnt down a few weeks ago.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Steinplatz Shrine</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Steinplatz is a small square in the northern quarter of Delberz, built around an elaborate shrine to Sigmar. This edifice is renowned for its ornamentation. Visitors marvel at the sheer number of flying buttresses, miniature spires, stone pinnacles, and gargoyles crammed onto a sanctuary no bigger than a haycart.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Steinplatz shrine houses a reliquary containing the severed hand of Grand Theogonist Helmgart. The von Sotturm family obtained the relic and donated it to the town of Delberz, commissioning the construction of a shrine ‘which should convey the majesty of Sigmar’s power’. They also stipulated that the main Temple in Delberz may have stewardship over the hand on condition that it remains in the shrine.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Helmgart’s hand is completely uncorrupted despite being separated from the rest of his body almost a hundred years ago. Most impressively, the fingernails continue to grow. The Sigmarite priests at the Delberz Temple slightly resent the steady flow of wealthy pilgrims visiting the shrine, but respect the sanctity of the relic’s presence. To deter thieves, they have posted a permanent guard in Steinplatz. Pieter Zuverst is a former halberdier with ideas above his station. He tells pilgrims that he is ‘High Sentinel of the Holy Hand’, although his main job is to stand still with a halberd. He is also charged with trimming the hand’s fingernails and returning the clippings to the main temple, a duty he thinks just short of sainthood itself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Followers of Sigmar who make an offering or pray at the shrine have a 2% chance of receiving a blessing, rising to 5% for those who pass an <strong>Average (+20) Pray</strong> Test. If successful, roll on the following table:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>d100 Results</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1–10 Cleansing the Taint.</strong> The supplicant feels shame at the stain of sorcery on their soul, the legacy of every time they have been exposed to magic. They are unaffected by the beneficial effects of spells for the next 24 hours.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>11–40 Hand of Fate.</strong> The supplicant feels their right hand lift of its own accord and form the two-fingered sign of Sigmar. They can invoke the Blessing of Courage and the Blessing of Protection (WFRP, page 221) once each, regardless of their Skills or Talents.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>41–60 Vision of Vengeance.</strong> The supplicant is flooded with an overwhelming sense of hatred towards anything touched by Chaos. For the next three days, they gain the Hatred Psychology when dealing with Mutants, Beastmen, or Chaos cultists.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>61–80 Exalted of Sigmar. </strong>The supplicant has a vision of the twin-tailed comet emblazoned on their forehead. It remains for five days, visible only to those with the Holy Visions Talent. Sigmar grants them an air of authority around his followers. They receive +30 to Leadership Tests with other Sigmarites and a clear belief that they are on a divine mission. If they do anything counter to Sigmar’s strictures (WFRP, page 211), this effect ends.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>81–100 Blessing of Nullification.</strong> The supplicant channels Helmgart’s distrust of Wizards and other practitioners of magic. The next spell cast against them rebounds on its caster as the supplicant experiences a divine presence protecting them. The recipient of this blessing cannot cast a spell until the Chaos moon Morrslieb next appears in the sky, though miracles are unaffected.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:'EB Garamond',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\"> </span></p>","folder":"zhKNzx21YVsaN3CA","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

Dwarf tunnel fighters and Middenheimer sewer jacks conduct regular sweeps of the lower levels, and the authorities follow up any sightings vigorously; in order to avoid panic, official policy is to deny that Skaven exist, and to maintain that the Dwarfs occupy the lowest levels of the undercity, leaving no tunnel or cavern unguarded.</p>\n<p>To the average Middenheimer, the Skaven are a myth; exterminated in the Skaven Wars more than a thousand years ago. Those who claim to have seen them are dismissed as cranks; those who claim they infest a massive tunnel network beneath the whole of the Old World have a tendency to find their way into the Sisters of Shallya, at remote asylums such as the Great Hospice near Frederheim.</p>\n<p>Of those who know about Skaven, the vast majority regard them as enemies. Even the other Ruinous Powers of Chaos distrust them as a race — but to a few, their services are valuable. Their secret ways allow them to move in and out of places unseen, and those who meet their price find them reliable. The evil Law Lord, @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}, hired a Skaven band for an important part of his plan: the kidnapping of @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich’s} niece Reya from her parents’ farmstead outside the town.</p>\n<p>While Wasmeier’s Doppelgänger, in the form of @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Law Lord Hoflich}, threatened the terrified Ehrlich into cooperating with the plan, the Skaven held Reya beneath the city. With the plan nearing its conclusion, they delivered his niece to Wasmeier’s human agent, who passed her on to @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich}.</p>\n<p>Having been assured of his reward, Snikkit has undertaken a further contract to retrieve a map showing @JournalEntry[F7Bh2C9eZXD9dkP3]{Brass Keep} from the @JournalEntry[ieHrUyFz83TkBikg]{Templar's Arms} — or wherever the Characters happen to be staying. His band also takes the opportunity to induldge in some slave raiding on the unfortunate occupants of the inn.  </p>\n<h3>Confusion In The Inn</h3>\n<p>The first thing the Characters know of events will be shouting and screaming from the inn’s main bar-room. They will have exactly one minute before the door is kicked open and they are faced with a pair of Skaven warriors. Run this minute in real time; time a minute from the first scream, add noises like shouting, crashes, footsteps on the stairs and so on. If the party ends up shouting at each other in a panic, things are going well.</p>\n<p>Keep a careful note of how long the Characters take to act. They should have time to grab a weapon, and put on easily-donned armour (coif, helmet, shield), but stopping to don a full suit of armour, or casting more than one spell per spellcaster, is out of the question. If the party is quick off the mark, they may be able to deal with several of the band piecemeal as they are still searching the inn in pairs and rounding up hostages; this will help them a great deal in any later confrontation.</p>\n<p>The Skaven band is rounding up everyone in the inn and herding them into the bar, where they are tied up. Those who offer no resistance will not be harmed (much); live humans have value in the undercity. Most of the inn’s guests will flee rather than fight. Just who is captured and who flees is up to you. However, it is suggested that the Halfling cook, @Actor[LBnd0qLlBx83Z1pD]{Tiasmara} be captured and threatened; this will stop @Actor[sXAWtX6OhNOpMuQc]{Uli} and his staff from wading in.</p>\n<p>Once they have tied up some guests, @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit} tears down an old campaign map showing the Middle Mountains which hangs on the bar’s wall, rolls it up, and sticks it in his belt. This is not likely to be noticed by the Characters until after the fact, and will not play a part in this adventure. </p>\n<p>Remember that this is a very volatile situation, and be prepared to play things by ear. Most of the Skaven are as nervous as their hostages, and may suddenly erupt into violence — or lose their nerve and make a run for it — at any time. If possible their leader, Snikkit, should either fight to the death or escape into the sewers, rather than being captured.</p>\n<h3>The Skaven</h3>\n<p>The band consists of @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit}, their leader, and six @Actor[pVTXDRks9nejkcbe]{Skaven warriors}. Numbers may be adjusted to ensure that they provide a challenge for the Characters, without being unbeatable.</p>\n<h3>A Helping Hand</h3>\n<p>While the number of Skaven should be adjusted to be roughly equal to the strength of the party, the incident might be used to introduce the Characters to a potential ally: the Deputy High Wizard’s younger sister, @Actor[ThOmnHA3l1Slh78K]{Erina Eberhauer}. If she is staying at the inn, add two or three more Skaven to the band so that the fight does not become too easy.</p>\n<p>Erina fights intelligently, staying out of the fray, and using ranged spells to help the Characters.</p>\n<p>She arrived in Middenheim earlier in the day, planning to surprise her sister. She does not willingly admit to being related to the @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Deputy High Wizard} — far too many people ask for favours — but she reports the Skaven to Janna, and mentions the Characters if they performed well. This may lead to an interview with the Deputy High Wizard, who wants to find out all she can about the incident, and track the Skaven’s route into the city if possible. The Characters may have the opportunity to ask some questions of their own, but Janna makes it clear that her questions must be answered first — until she becomes convinced that the new taxes are a part of some sinister plan.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[ThOmnHA3l1Slh78K]{Erina Eberhauer}</h3>\n<p>In her early 20s and of average height, Erina has an athletic build, auburn hair, hazel eyes, and a smattering of freckles that belie a serious nature. Those who have seen her sister the Deputy High Wizard will notice a family resemblance on a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test. Erina is fiercely intelligent, decisive, and matter-of-fact; while not unfriendly, she will initially be reserved toward the Characters, and everyone else.</p>\n<h3>The Battle</h3>\n<p>The party can stand and fight, or they can flee. In either case, they should survive — perhaps wounded, and perhaps minus a Fate Point or two, but alive.</p>\n<p>The Watch will arrive in force ([[/r 2D10 + 2]] Watchmen with two Sergeants and a Captain) some 5 minutes after the attack begins. If the Skaven have been defeated by then, all well and good. The Captain asks for the Characters’ names and commend them on their public-spirited actions. The following afternoon, they and any NPCs who assisted are summoned by @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Watch Commander Schutzmann}, who listens to their account of the incident and offers them his congratulations; this can be a very good introduction to this NPC — see @JournalEntry[3sFdJskJYiLvUWkc]{The Debrief} for more.</p>\n<p>If the party fails to deal with the situation, the Skaven leave the inn, vanishing into the night.</p>\n<h3>Prisoners</h3>\n<p>If the party takes any prisoners, they have a limited time to question them before the Watch takes them away. None know where they went in the city; they moved underground by a twisting route. All they can say is that they took a young, female Human from a farm, and hid her in the Drakwald Forest before bringing her to the city. They cannot describe the person to whom they handed the young woman over, apart from stating that he had prominent 'whiskers'.</p>\n<h4>A Lucky Find</h4>\n<p>If time is pressing and the players have somehow managed to get nowhere — but not otherwise — you might allow the Characters a clue to help them find the @Scene[mdyEnjutTaGPzPxz]{lair} of @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} agent @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} and her minions. @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit}, the Skaven leader, is carrying a crude map that shows a part of the city’s sewer system and a location marked with a few symbols in the Skaven tongue of Queekish. It is quite unlikely that any of the Characters can read this language, and none of the other Skaven is literate: still, this location is clearly significant, and may be where the child was delivered. A <strong>Difficult (–10) Navigation</strong> Test will enable the Characters to follow the map to the lair.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>TEMPERED LUCK</em></h3>\n<p><em>The above option gives GMs an solution for parties who are truly lost — the Skaven attack wherever they are staying, and a convenient map leads directly to the kidnapped neice of @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich}. While Ehrlich does not know quite who is blackmailing him, he is sure to make such a fuss that @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, fearful the net may be closing about him, will make his move on the Graf early — preferably while the Characters are nearby to intervene.</em></p>\n<p><em>However, most struggling parties will not require such drastic measures. Instead, you may wish to have a surviving Skaven, fluent in Reikspeial, add that he heard the girl calling out for her uncle, who she claimed was 'an wielder of laws, yes yes!' This could be used to put direct the Characters towards @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich}, without also short-circuiting the entire plot.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Skaven Myth</h3>\n<p>Reports of Skaven will be treated with skepticism by the Watch and other city authorities. Most Middenheimers know the story of Count Mandred and the Ratmen, but only as a fable. Only a few believe it is based on fact, and most of those regard the ‘Ratmen’ as normal Beastmen, whose rat heads were added by some storyteller centuries ago. If the Characters’ account is backed up by multiple witnesses, the authorities grudgingly concede that these particular beastmen did indeed have rat-like heads — but rats are beasts, after all, so there is no reason to suppose that these creatures are some mythical threat out of an old story. Some slightly more informed people might claim that Skaven were real, but Mandred did away with every last one centuries ago. </p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/heres-snikkit.webp","folder":"9nJ4brecw2MRO3vH","sort":1675000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":1675000}}}

{"_id":"ZDyb9Dfsd7SfnKVs","name":"Initial Inquiries: The Taxes","content":"<p>@JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{The Taxes}</p>\n<p>Sooner or later, the Characters should come to the conclusion that it would be worthwhile to find out more about the new tax laws that have upset so many people. Depending on their careers, personalities, and inclinations, they have several possible sources, each of which can provide certain information. Of course, each of these sources has its own point of view, which complicates matters somewhat: some ambiguities or downright contradictions may arise, requiring the Characters to sift through the snippets of information they have amassed and put the pieces together as best they can. The GM should not be afraid to repeat items: observant Players realise that confirmations are valuable.</p>\n<h3>General Sentiments</h3>\n<p>Reactions to the new taxes vary widely. Apart from a few, described above — who think the taxes are an Ulrican plot to force out other religions, an Altdorfer conspiracy to weaken the city in preparation for conquest and subjugation, a profiteering move by the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}, or an Elven plot against the city’s Dwarfs — the majority of Middenheimers do not much care one way or the other. So long as they are unaffected, the taxes are someone else’s problem. A few may grumble about delays at the gates, but that is all.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are especially slow to realise the deeper implications of the taxes, they may overhear some bar-room pundit holding forth on the contributions of the Dwarfs, the wizards, and the priests to Middenheim’s construction and defence. Over the jeers and groans of his listeners, this prophet of doom loudly maintains that someone high up in the government is trying to drive them all out, clearly for some sinister purpose. Most people, though, are concerned with the pleasures of the Carnival, and with their own day-to-day worries.</p>\n<p>Those directly affected by the taxes have a different attitude. Any Dwarf is furious about the Dwarf Tax, both at the cost, and at the insult it represents to the Dwarven race: <em>‘No Elf Tax, is there? Halfling Tax? Not on your life? Human Tax? Now that one would make some money — but no. It’s an outrage, so it is, and by stone and steel we won’t stand for it!’</em></p>\n<p>Wizards, alchemists, and priests, while privately fuming, are less vocal until they know they are among friends. The Guild and the various temples are pursuing the matter, they are sure, and the Graf is not an unreasonable man: this is clearly some mistake, and will shortly be corrected. Of course, there are always a few individuals who react more strongly, especially after a few drinks, and students at the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica} may take the opportunity to abandon their classes for a day of protests, drinking, and general rowdiness. They may hope to arouse more widespread public indignation, but mostly they will succeed in annoying their fellow citizens.</p>\n<p>Only a few people are enthusiastically in favour of the new taxes. Elves smirk and joke about the Dwarf Tax, and those with reason to dislike wizards or priests do the same about those taxes, but almost no one vocally supports all three measures.</p>\n<p>The exception is members of the Purple Hand, who have been instructed by their superiors to promote the taxes at every opportunity. However, they have little idea why the taxes are important, and their arguments may seem ill-informed and unconvincing.</p>\n<p>Eventually, this constant background noise should prompt the Characters to seek information from reliable sources. This may include various guilds, Komissions, temples, and any major NPCs whose acquaintance is the way into the main part of the adventure.</p>\n<p>The following information can be gained from Middenheimers of all types. The tone and some minor details might be altered to reflect the nature of the informant: a drunkard can only tell a little, a barman a little more, and a modestly-educated merchant more still. Educated people, if asked specific questions they are unable to answer, and direct the Characters to an appropriate source for further information.</p>\n<h4>When Were the Taxes Passed?</h4>\n<p>The tax changes were introduced just under a month ago. Some taxes are taken when entering and leaving the city, and a widespread belief is that they have been introduced to coincide with Carnival, to rake in more money from visitors. Others are taken at the end of every month. The first monthly payment is due at the end of the Carnival. So far, the authorities have been very zealous about collecting them.</p>\n<h4>Who Sets the Tax Laws?</h4>\n<p>The average citizen can only give partial, and sometimes misleading, information. By far the most common reply points to the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, since his prime role is the implementation of fiscal policy. Other candidates are the Graf and the Law Lords, both being seen as great wielders of power. A more enlightened informant may direct the Characters to the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful GuiId of Legalists}, saying that they can get a fuller version there.</p>\n<h4>Graf Boris and his Advisors</h4>\n<p>It is common knowledge that @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} is ailing and depends heavily on his advisors. Some — the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, the Law Lords, the ‘@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Princess}’ — are widely known as influential, while some are not; no one knows, for example, that the Graf has a paramour. Some major NPCs are more socially visible than others: the Chancellor, being a recluse, is hardly known by most people, while the @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Court Minstrel}, a real extrovert, is better-known.</p>\n<h4>The Graf ’s Sons</h4>\n<p>The common folk are dimly aware that @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan} has some kind of health issue, but know little of him and have never seen him. @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich} is a more interesting case. He is not particularly well-known among the general public, for he adopts a low profile in social life, and is out of the city for long periods of time. However, most Middenheimers should be able to give at least a vague description of him, ‘HUGE man, he is — a giant!’.</p>\n<h4>Red Herrings</h4>\n<p>Some folk give credence to bizarre rumours. Graf Boris is controlled by Daemons; he converses with a magical oracular pool in the palace; or any of a dozen equally wild tales. </p>\n<p>In general, the people holding these views also believe that the world is flat, that Mannslieb is made of cheese, and so on, and the Characters should have cause to doubt them. Of course, certain rumours are more widespread: for example, Rallane is frequently blamed for the Dwarf Tax (although not for the others), and the Midden Marshals are generally thought to have more political influence than they do.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE CITY COUNCILS</em></h3>\n<p><em>There are three councils that are relevant to this stage of the adventure: the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists}, the @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, and the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission for Elven, Dwarven and Halfling Interests}. Their offices are open from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. Asking questions at any of the other City Councils is  a waste of time.</em></p>\n<p><em>They generally work on the same principle: an enquirer explains the nature of the enquiry to a clerk, who then wanders off to locate the person best able to deal with the question. This can take anything up to an hour, but a 15-minute wait is average. Of course, if the enquirer has subsequent questions, or if the original question was phrased ambiguously, then another official may have to be found.</em></p>\n<p><em>For the questions the Characters may ask, the correct official is named; on future visits they can ask for him or her personally and save time, cutting the average waiting time to 10 minutes.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{The Worshipful Guild Of Legalists}</h3>\n<p>This guild has many functions connected with the law. Indeed, it was they who drafted the new taxes, but it is not their job to formulate original policy. They deal in facts in vast quantities — and prepare official versions for release to the public.</p>\n<p>Clerk Hubergreiber, a low-ranking clerk, is the man to see about the tax laws. He is able to provide a summary of the @JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{information}: who is taxed, when, how often, and how much. He can say, if asked, that the tax was implemented less than one month ago, and that the first monthly collection is due the day after the Carnival ends. The Guild is looking for more scribes to handle the monumental quantity of paperwork required by the new laws. Hubergreiber may offer a job to any character with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write} Talent, especially if they also have <em>Art (Writing)</em> or <em>Art (Calligraphy)</em>.</p>\n<h4>Who Sets the Tax Laws?</h4>\n<p>Senior Clerk Wahnsinnige can discuss this in a very dry, bureaucratic manner. The GM should read the players the following information more or less verbatim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The interests of merchants, and similar people are represented by the Chairman of the Merchants’ Guild, who makes recommendations to the City Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation. The current Chairman of the Guild — Herr Gotthard Wallenstein — is also, as it happens, Chairman of the Komission.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other interested bodies, such as the temples and the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, make their representations via other city Councils, according to the nature of the matter at hand: in some cases the @JournalEntry[WI5fxShETkV7ungB]{Komission for Health, Education and Welfare}; in others the @JournalEntry[fofmTR3LuoaMVLa0]{Komission for Public Works}; and so on.</p>\n<p>The @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation} then makes representations to the Law Lords. The Law Lords weigh up the matter, and the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists} assists in the drafting of proposed legislation. The resulting document is put before the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, who may make further recommendations, and then before the Graf. The Graf then weighs up the matter after discussing it with other advisors, and may pass the legislation, return it with directions for amendment, or, in rare cases, reject it.</p>\n<p>The @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists} does not itself have any role in forming policy, but merely drafts the laws as directed by the Law Lords, after due and aforementioned consultation.</p>\n<p>As to the advisors to whom the Graf may turn for comments on proposed legislation, Graf Boris may consult anyone who he feels is qualified to render useful advice.</p>\n<p>This tells the Characters very little, and a tiresome encounter it is too, although the gist is simple enough: the Graf speaks to anyone he wants, listens to anyone he wants, and everyone else does what he wants.</p>\n<h4>The Law Lords</h4>\n<p>Any questions about the role of the Law Lords is referred to Clerk Valberik, who is able to summarise the workings of the Law Lords: they vote on policy in secret meetings, and the majority decision is put to the Graf. If the decision is not unanimous, differences of opinion are never revealed.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{The Komission For Elven, Dwarven, and Halfling Interests}</h3>\n<p>The Council was set up over a hundred years ago when there was tension between Elves and Dwarfs, and both communities felt ill-treated by the Human majority in the city. The ruler at the time thought it a wise move to institute this official channel to care for their interests, and did not want to offend the more placid Halflings by leaving them out. It is now not very active, but is responsible for organising some of the nonhuman cultural events in the Carnival. Waiting and bureaucracy here are minimal.</p>\n<h4>General Enquiries</h4>\n<p>A nonhuman character can arrange for an interview here on almost any pretext. Enquiries are usually dealt with by a staff member of the same race as the enquirer: Dwarfs are met by Clerk Thognar, Elves by Clerk Malondel, and Halflings by Clerk Huggins. Both Elf and Halfling have little to say, except that the Dwarf Tax sets a bad precedent. In addition, Malondel points out that with many Elves following wizardry as a profession, the Scroll Tax is causing concern. Humans can see Thognar about the Dwarf Tax, or Malondel about the Scroll Tax, if they express concern and seem interested in doing something about it.</p>\n<h4>Rallane and the Dwarf Tax</h4>\n<p>If Malondel is asked about the court minstrel @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}, and his possible role in the Dwarf Tax, he looks most disapproving and say that this is a scurrilous rumour spread about by people who ought to know better. The view held by Elves (and Halflings) is that it is simply a money-grabbing exercise by the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}.</p>\n<p>If Clerk Thognar is asked about this, he tries to hides his seething anger. He explains that the Dwarfs are collecting a petition complaining at great length to Graf Boris, ‘and we can count on your signatures, of course?’ If he is taken out after work for a drink, he becomes more forthcoming (unless there are any Elves with the party) and denounce Rallane as the person responsible for the tax: <em>‘He hates our people, and other folk think we’re all rich because we work hard — that’s probably how he got support for the idea.’</em></p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/elven-dwarf-halfling-interests.webp\" width=\"246\" height=\"199\" /></div>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{The Komission For Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}</h3>\n<p>Although this is an obvious place to enquire about the tax changes, the Chairman of the Council, @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}, is almost never here, and neither he nor the senior clerk Franz Christoph Becker agrees to see the Characters anyway. Clerk Udiller sees the Characters but, following his masters’ lead, will say little. Given half a chance, the clerk directs the Characters to another council or guild, saying that the Komission’s job is simply to collect the taxes in the most efficient way: ‘It’s nothing to do with us, really.’ This Komission is gaining a reputation for doing nothing for anyone but the merchants.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/commerce-trade-taxation.webp\" width=\"169\" height=\"189\" /></div>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE GUILDS</em></h3>\n<p><em>These institutions exist to promote the interests of their members. Middenheim, like any other large city, has its fair share of guilds, though for this adventure only four are relevant: the Grand Guild of Wizards, the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}, the @JournalEntry[A6D8GCA2S0g8vw8K]{Dwarven Engineers’ Guild}, and — though not exactly a guild — the loose-knit community of Middenheim’s underworld.</em></p>\n<p><em>On visiting a guild, an individual is asked to provide a membership number. If he or she is not a member, provisional acceptance can be made for the duration of Carnival week. This costs a gold crown, and the character must prove eligibility for membership by answering some profession-related questions. A guild does not deal with persons who are not members.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{The Grand Guild Of Wizards}</h3>\n<p>At this stage, no one — not even a wizard — can get a meeting with the @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{High Wizard} or his @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Deputy}, but the Characters can try to by-pass formal procedure and try to meet them in a public or social encounter.</p>\n<p>Even so, the guildhouse is bustling with Wizards and Apprentices: some looking for news; some looking for contacts with Wizards in other cities besides Altdorf; and some simply looking for like-minded folk to vent their frustrations. Feelings are running high: some wizards have already left Middenheim to avoid the monthly tax, though the majority are waiting to see if an eleventh-hour agreement can be reached. Guild members are mystified by the taxes, pointing out the role of the Guild and the High Wizard in maintaining the defences of the city.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/grand-guild-of-wizards.webp\" width=\"307\" height=\"184\" /></div>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{The Merchants’ Guild}</h3>\n<p>The drinking-room of this guild is always full of merchants and traders discussing this and that, and they happily talk about the taxes. They are not too bothered, for the most part: <em>‘Glad it wasn’t us’</em> is the usual attitude. The more thoughtful types, though, are concerned:<em> ‘It’ll turn out badly. The Dwarfs are good workers and good spenders, and this will bring trouble.’</em> Several members suspect that the Chancellor is behind the taxes, especially the Scroll Tax. <em>‘Sort of thing he’d do. Problem with him is he doesn’t see the effects on people. Bit of a recluse, he is.’</em></p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[A6D8GCA2S0g8vw8K]{The Dwarven Engineers’ Guild}</h3>\n<p>A similar response is seen here as at the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission for Elven, Dwarven, and Halfling Interests}. A petition is proffered, even if the Characters have signed it before. Nothing new can be learned over a few beers; the Dwarfs — mainly engineers and  artisans — spend most of their time moaning and making provisional plans to leave. There is some talk of ambushing either @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} or the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, and making the Dwarf point of view known forcefully.</p>\n<h3>The Underworld</h3>\n<p>There is no centralised Thieves’ Guild in Middenheim, but most criminal activities are overseen by two powerful gangs, one based in Ostwald and the other in the Altquartier. The leaders of these gangs are known colloquially in Middenheim as the @JournalEntry[vcw9pxNsMoxkTbRV]{Low Kings}. They vie with each other violently, and any criminal who seeks to operate in their territories without handing over a quota of their takings best keep their activities secret, unless they are forced at knifepoint to be more cooperative.</p>\n<p>There are various ways of contacting the underworld. For example, a Thief (or other Rogue Character) might locate an NPC rogue by watching for signs of thieving on the streets — requiring a successful <strong>Difficult (+0) Observe</strong> Test, repeated every hour until successful — or an NPC thief might spot and approach a Character thief.</p>\n<p>In the second case, the NPC makes a sign of recognition specific to Middenheim. When the Character fails to respond properly, the NPC will quietly point out that it might be a good idea to come along for a chat: after all, it’s difficult to pick a pocket without fingers, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>After some preliminary sounding-out in which the locals will establish to their satisfaction that the Character is genuine and not in the pay of the authorities, a nocturnal meeting is arranged. The Character is offered provisional membership to cover Carnival week at a cost of a gold crown, and is then taught the local dialect of <em>Thieves’ Tongue</em> (the character must already have the basic Skill) and told about various contact points. If there is time for a solo adventure, the Character thief might be set a task as proof of ability and goodwill.</p>\n<p>Questions about the taxes or the court is met with some puzzlement, but this is satisfied by any reasonably non-committal reply (‘just curiosity: it seems a bit odd’). The NPC thief casually mentions that he knows someone who can find out anything about anything, if the price is right. If the Character agrees, a further meeting is arranged in a secluded tavern some 12 hours later, for a [[/r d10+3]] shilling, ‘arrangement fee.’</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At this meeting, the Character is introduced to ‘Josef,’ a shifty individual aged about 40, who never looks anyone in the eye. Josef collects and sells information for a living — he neither knows nor cares what any of it means, so long as he gets his fee ([@Pay[3ss]{3 schillings}, in advance, no haggling). He charges an additional fee (which he may try to bargain upwards, though usually about 2 shillings) for each piece of information he passes on. Josef never reveals his sources.</p>\n<h4>Josef ’s Knowledge</h4>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} is probably not behind the Dwarf Tax. It is not his style, and he expressed surprise when it was introduced ([[/r d10]] shillings).</p>\n<p>The Midden Marshals do not have as much influence as many people claim, and the @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Knight Eternal} has none at all ([[/r 2d10]] shillings).</p>\n<p>@Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich} was seen leaving the Palace visibly upset the day Graf Boris passed the new taxes. This coincided with the start of his current fit of depression ([[/r 5d10]] shillings).</p>\n<p>After passing on this information, Josef develops an uneasy  look, and players may guess that he knows more. If pressed, helean forwards and say in a low voice:</p>\n<p><em>‘All right, but putting this in the wrong ears could get you burnt or worse. @Pay[1gc]{A Crown} gets you something about Ar-Ulric — no messing about, yes or no?’</em> He can be bargained down to @Pay[10ss]{10 schillings}, and if an agreement is reached he says that Ar-Ulric has been seen leaving the apartments of the Ladies-at-Court late at night: <em>‘A bit naughty, that, considering his vow of celibacy and all.’</em></p>\n<p>Josef may possess other pieces of information, if you wish. Their price can be based on the importance of the individual or group mentioned.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE TEMPLES</em></h3>\n<p><em>Any Character priest who visits his or her temple in the city hears a good deal of complaint. The biggest question concerns the relationship between the Graf and the cult of Ulric. On the one hand, why would the Graf risk alienating them when the cult of Sigmar already regards him as a threat? On the other hand, why has the cult of Ulric not spoken out against the taxes, especially when High Priest Ar-Ulric is one of the Graf’s advisors?</em></p>\n<p><em>Popular rumour is that, while they have a lot to lose, the cult of Ulric is the richest in the city, and plans to sit tight while pressure of taxation squeezes the others out.</em></p>\n<p><em>There is no information on the origins of the taxes or the destination of the money raised, but the temples know that the taxes certainly do not reflect any popular anti-clerical feeling. If anything, the general population was as surprised as the groups affected.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: If the Character priest visit the temples of other deities, they should behave with the utmost respect and tact. In particular, the presence of a priest of Sigmar in the temple of Ulric (or vice-versa) could be seen as provocative.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{The Temple Of Ulric}</h3>\n<p>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} is frequently absent on business, but his juniors, Franz Fassbinder and Gilda Heinzer, ensure that little is given away here. They are both excellent at deflecting questions. </p>\n<p>Even the junior priests say little. It is clear that the priests are not happy about the tax, but they do not condemn it in as forthright a manner as one might expect: a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test reveals that a priest interviewed here appears to be hesitant in what he or she is saying.</p>\n<p>The priests of Ulric are in a difficult position: they cannot openly condemn the taxes without appearing to condemn their leader’s apparent failure to stop them, and yet they cannot speak in their favour either. Most try to skirt the issue, saying that such matters are not for ordinary folk to comment on; they may be more open with a character who wins their trust and approaches the question diplomatically.</p>\n<p>If a Character priest of Ulric is able to gain an interview with Fassbinder or Heinzer (this takes 1-3 days to arrange, and only priests of Ulric are admitted) a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test leads to their dropping a hint about their reasons for their relative lack of vigour in originally condemning the taxes: they must follow @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric’s} lead, and he has given no sign of his views on the matter: on an Impressive or better success, they say that he seems preoccupied lately, and he has been difficult to approach.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[vAaGf9u5fHrlxSSs]{The Temple Of Sigmar}</h3>\n<p>Feelings run higher here than in the temple of Ulric, and, although the priests are rather tight-lipped, their anger is obvious. On a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Gossip</strong> Test, a junior priest might forget himself so far as to accuse Ar-Ulric of supporting the tax to squeeze the other temples out of the city; on an Impressive or better success, he may even question whether the temple of Ulric is actually paying the Temple Tax.</p>\n<p>The priests of Sigmar also feel that the Dwarf Tax is a deliberate slight on their cult, given the historical links between the cult of Sigmar and the Dwarven people.</p>\n<p>High Capitular Werner Stolz (a High Priest of Sigmar) is not available to meet with the Characters, but they can learn that he met with the Grand Theogonist privately during his recent visit, and denounced both Ar-Ulric and Graf Boris in no uncertain terms. Needless to say, this does nothing to reduce the current tension between the Empire’s two greatest religions.</p>\n<p>A character who makes sympathetic noises in all the right places, or who is a follower of Sigmar, may be rewarded by a priest forgetting himself for a moment, and letting slip the news that Stolz is setting off for Altdorf after the Carnival, to put his case to the Emperor in person. This is clearly very sensitive information, and careless talk only make matters worse. This news should also lead them to realise that if anything is to be done about the tax changes, it must be done before the end of Carnival week.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>GM OPTION: DROPPING NAMES</em></h3>\n<p><em>A visit to the Temple of Ulric offers the GM a chance to have the Characters meet two NPCs — one is destined for greatness, the other for notoriety — but at present they are still relatively obscure. For the players, a chance meeting with a character whose name they recognise can make a lasting impression.</em></p>\n<p><em>If you prefer not to use these characters, or to save them for another point in the campaign, that is quite permissible. They might be posted to temples away from Middenheim at the moment, eagerly awaiting the promotions that will bring them back to the City of the White Wolf, and one step closer to making history.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Temple Of Shallya</h3>\n<p>The Characters are able to encounter junior priests fairly easily, but need a good reason to gain an appointment with the High Priestess, @Actor[3LymwsbJMdZVMfgd]{Isolde Begegnen}.</p>\n<p>Here, the priests denounce the Temple Tax openly: it is taking money which would have helped the poor and sick, and putting it in the Graf ’s coffers. The Dwarf and Scroll Taxes are aimed at some of their more generous contributors, making matters worse. The temple is simple, and clearly keeps little of the money it receives — unlike some.</p>\n<p>The temple of Shallya also resents Ar-Ulric’s lack of action — he is supposed to represent all temple interests in court circles, and has clearly failed them on this occasion. Some Sigmarites have over-reacted badly, accusing Ar-Ulric of plotting with the Graf to get rid of them: this is clearly ridiculous, since the Temple Tax affects the temple of Ulric as much as any other in the city.</p>\n<p>The Characters might come here if they need healing, so Isolde Begegnen’s profile is given below: she may or may not treat injured Characters in person, but her profile indicates what is available if they are in serious need. A donation is not obligatory, but would be very much appreciated.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/temple-of-shallya.webp\" width=\"554\" height=\"576\" /></div>","folder":"Evbhh3cOQ21VdDSM","sort":550000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 4: Initial Inquiries","sort":550000}}}

He has decided to try his hand at being a legitimate merchant, but has retained a few of his old criminal contacts.</p>\n<p>He recently received a shipment of Mootland leaf, which would have been a nice little earner for him. However it was stolen from his lock-up near the fish wharf a few nights ago.</p>\n<p>When he explained to Tarwin Fleischer about the delay in delivering the goods the man became very violent, and thrashed him.</p>\n<p>Tristan is too scared of the Fish to think of telling the Watch about Tarwin, but he is anxious to recover the Mootland leaf, and he will not leave the Watch station, even to seek medical attention, until a patrol has been to his warehouse.</p>\n<h2>AT THE WAREHOUSE</h2>\n<p>If the PCs go the lock-up near the Fish wharfs they will find the area curiously deserted. Even though there seems to be plenty of work to be done the Fish are mostly elsewhere. There are a few caretakers and stevedores about.</p>\n<p>A man called Jost Kulleraugen is responsible for looking after the warehouse in which Mahler has his lock-up. He is a lazy and somewhat senile old man, who does nothing to ensure the safety of the goods in his care beyond sit on the front warehouse steps all day hoping that some passing person will talk to him.</p>\n<p>In the lock up the Watch can make a Search Skill test. For every one passed the watch find the following pieces of information.</p>\n<p>&bull; In one corner is a chair, in front of which is a small spattering of drops of blood.</p>\n<p>&bull; Near the chair is a crumpled handkerchief, of poor quality. The handkerchief was discarded by Tarwin after he had finished beating Mahler. It is covered in red and green stains.</p>\n<p>&bull; A piece of paper is left near the back of the warehouse.

He will say that the warehouse is where he interviewed Tarwin Fleischer for his article on the Hooks and the Fish.</p>\n<h2>IF TARWIN IS CONFRONTED WITH THIS</h2>\n<p>He will be cocksure. He knows he is guilty of beating up Mahler, but he is also sure that the bawd is too scared of the Fish to accuse one of them of assault. He will ask who is bringing these accusations against him if he is accused of anything, and then will deny all involvement.</p>\n<p>If asked where Drago Vedris interviewed him, Tarwin will say it was by the river, actually stood upon the Fish wharf.</p>\n<h2>MAHLER&rsquo;S REACTION</h2>\n<p>Once Mahler is told that the patrol have been to the warehouse and have found any leads he will collapse in relief and then pull himself together and visit a local physician.</p>\n<p>He will be keen to point out, many times and at length, that he has no problems with Tarwin or any other members of the Fish.</p>\n<p>Whilst anyone can guess that he is lying he will not be persuaded to point the finger at the Fish man, either publicly or privately. In fact he will attempt a pained chumminess with Tarwin should the two of them meet.

The Emperor’s tolerance of mutants has angered the fierce Sons of Ulric, and now the most devout among them are seeking to drive all other priests from Middenheim, to make it Ulric’s city alone.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Emperor has summoned all his military commanders to the palace to discuss the problems in Middenheim. He has also demanded that Graf Boris Todbringer, the Elector Count of Middenheim, join him in the capital immediately.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Emperor’s infamous mutant decree is an attempt to avoid open war with Middenheim. Why, everyone knows the Beastmen of the Drakwald were once as Human as Graf Boris himself. Mutation’s spreading across the province, as though some strange influence were at work.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rats of Middenheim’s sewers are not like any rats found in the south. Full 6 ft long, they are — and some of them stand upright, wear clothes, and talk to each other in squeaks and chitters. Middenheim’s rat catchers earn their pay, and no mistake!</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mutants and bandits continue to attack coaches passing through the Drakwald. The major coaching companies are hiring extra guards, the Roadwardens are recruiting in Altdorf and the surrounding area, but the Emperor has failed to send troops to protect the highway. Meanwhile, streams of refugees leaving Middenheim are at the mercy of bandits and beastmen.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The followers of Ulric are becoming even more militant. Not content with persecuting honest and devout Sigmarites, now they have begun picking on the priests of every other deity — and even on the Dwarfs, who helped build Middenheim. A ruinous series of tax laws has been passed, targeting Elves, Dwarfs, wizards, and priests, in particular.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All these new taxes can mean only one thing: the Graf is filling his coffers to hire troops and mercenaries. He may be preparing to intervene in the growing conflict between Ostland and Talebecland — or he may intend to break with the Emperor, and fortify the north banks of the Reik and the Talabec against southern aggression.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A heresy is being bandied about, claiming that Sigmar was never a god — just a mortal hero crowned as Emperor by the high priest of Ulric. They claim that Ulric is the true god of the Empire, and Sigmarites are heretics. Tension between north and south comes and goes, but all the bad feeling seems to be coalescing around religious differences. Some Ulrican fanatics even want the north to break with the rest of the Empire and become a separate nation.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ar-Ulric has not made any statements about the heresy or the activities of the fanatical bandits who call themselves the Sons of Ulric. He has condemned their suggestions that he consider abdicating so that one of them can take his place, of course. He has said their belief that they descend from Ulric is highly apocryphal, and he supports the Graf in outlawing their public assembly in the city, but when it comes to their persecutions of Sigmarites in Middenland he keeps his mouth shut.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The mother-in-law of the informant’s cousin is a washerwoman at Castle Reikguard.

There were witch-hunters up from Altdorf the other week. They burnt seventeen people at the stake for being Chaos-worshippers and witches. Seventeen! Why do the Graf's people need Southerners to do this - aren't they able to root out followers of Chaos themselves? Or mayhap there's a reason they don't want to, eh?

Someone from the Emperor's court is in Middenheim at the moment, and they're being very secretive about it. It's someone high up, and I hear tell it's the Grand Theogonist. There's a detachment of Sigmarite Templars in the city at the moment, who are supposed to be his body￾guards.

There's a lot of new taxes being introduced all at once, and that usually means only one thing - war! The Graf is filing his coffers so he can hire troops and mercenaries.

As his former nanny, Hildegarde has modest influence with Graf Boris (1 vote).</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Hildegarde is almost always with the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess,’} living in adjacent rooms at the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{palace}. Like her charge, she is not easy to meet, but she does attend a few Carnival events, one or two on her own. She favours high culture, and exotic events such as fire-breathers and singing frogs.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Males with Fellowship scores below 40 will never win her approval: there is no point even rolling dice.</p>\n<p><strong>Elves</strong>: +5 to all Fellowship Tests. She likes their refined nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: –10 to all Fellowship Tests. She finds them coarse.</p>\n<p><strong>Halflings</strong>: +5 to +10 to all Fellowship Tests, if enthusiastic about cookery — Hildegarde is proud of the cakes she serves at afternoon tea, which she makes herself.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Hildegarde’s main role is to make it difficult for the Characters to meet with the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess,’} especially alone. Considerable ingenuity may be required to get her out of the way for a little while: an irresistible distraction (singing frogs, for example), or the rumour of one, might induce her to leave her charge (who detests slimy creatures) for an hour.</p>\n<p>Hildegarde knows much about the city, and the Graf ’s family, but only in the form of personal anecdotes. Much of what she thinks she knows is laced with unreliable gossip. Her tales might be used to foster suspicions that may be helpful or not, depending on how the adventure is progressing.</p>\n<p>She is very protective of the family, and faced with a plausible argument that some danger threatens the Graf, she may be swayed.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Hildegarde has commended the @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Knight Eternal} to the Graf many times, and is convinced that he has some influence. She refuses to believe that the Graf listens to any Lady at Court.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Hildegarde’s main goal is to protect the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’} from unworthy men — which, in her opinion, is all of them. She is fiercely loyal to the Graf, whom she virtually reared: any threat to him, real or imagined, will stir her to formidable action — but she will never forgive being misled or exploited.</p>\n<p>She dislikes the Temple Tax, likes the Dwarf Tax (‘such coarse folk’), and cares little about the Scroll Tax. These are not strong feelings, and she regards politics (especially taxation) as somewhat sordid.</p>\n<p>She is appalled by @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}, and would love to see him banished. She finds him far too forward and is not comfortable with him being around the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’}. (See below for more details.) She casts aspersions on the legitimacy of his qualifications, but the real reason for her utter contempt for him is his vulgar flirtation. She may insist that the Characters discredit him in exchange for any help from her — and she will demand a detailed plan and regular progress reports. This may create problems for the Characters, since Luigi may be crucial to de-hypnotising @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} — not to mention that he is a source of precious influence with Graf Boris.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Hildegarde  dislikes him, and may imply that he filches from the Treasury. Since he is nervous whenever the two meet, she has not noticed his recent twitchy behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: She approves of his manners, but is a little snobbish about his humble origins. She is happier now that he is engaged to be married, and therefore poses no threat to the ‘Princess.’</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: No strong feelings, though she dislikes his moodiness. She does not know that he harbours feelings for Katarina.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — The ‘Princess’</strong>: Utterly devoted to her, protective, and blind to all her faults, save that she is a little headstrong at times. </p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Has no dealings with them at all, and can scarcely recall their names.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Has always thought him too soft in matters of public morals and decency. Increasingly suspicious of his obvious anxiety, she distrusts him for no reason she can name. She knows nothing of his affair with the Graf ’s paramour.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ybdS4Z0pbWL8oiND]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Regards them all as ‘loose women’, cuts them dead socially, and refuses to discuss them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: A formal relationship characterised by elaborate manners, largely restricted to superficial exchanges at court functions. He seems like a fine young man, if a little slow.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Knows him only slightly; vaguely likes him for his excellent manners, but disapproves of his ‘gadding about town.’ Knows him to be loyal, honest, and fair.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Has never heard of the man, and does not discuss merchants and commerce.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Hildegarde has protested loudly and often to Graf Boris that this appalling man should not live in the same building as the Princess. Luigi once made indecent advances to Hildegarde — a joke on his part, though Hildegarde does not appreciate the irony.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Approves of their grave and dignified demeanour, but thinks they should stop fiddling with taxes and draft some useful laws to restore public morals and decency — preferably with public floggings.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer:</strong> The Chaperone would never entertain the idea of conversing with a criminal such as Rothbert. She might change her mind if she realised he knows about her nephew @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Sees Breugal partly as a kindred spirit, and partly as a rival for her self-appointed position as the court’s arbiter of etiquette and genteel behaviour. She secretly relishes their contests of etiquette, which both regard as something like a duel against a worthy opponent: each of them believes they have the lead in this ongoing contest.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Zimperlich respects the High Priestess’s position, but thinks she’s too subtle in her religious teachings on the law. The Chaperone considers it fairly easy to work out who is guilty and what fate they should suffer. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>Zimperlich has some respect for Isolde, as she behaves just as a Shallyan should. She also supports the princess’s involvement in a worthy cause like the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya}. Zimperlich would rather not get too close to the temple if she can avoid it, because she’s not particularly partial to grubby orphans or smelly poor people. </p>\n<h3>Deadly Secret: A Black Sheep</h3>\n<p>Hildegarde has a shameful secret: her younger sister died in childbirth, and she raised the child herself. Her nephew, @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl}, turned out very badly (see @JournalEntry[mNMoXXZJKYGjXH7O]{The Harmacist}). While she has cut all ties and will never mention him, she feels guilty for how he turned out, and fears disgrace and scandal if their relationship should become known. </p>\n<p>If the secret is discovered, the Characters might take advantage of it, but they will need to be subtle. For example, they might mention in passing that they have discovered that someone at court has a young ne’er-do-well for a relative — not that they would ever gossip or name names, of course. Overt attempts at blackmail will alienate her completely.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, <em>@JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{A Knight’s Midsummer Dream}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Dwavern Valley Choirs}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Elven Lightsingers}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants and Jousting}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 1)}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 2)}</p>\n<h3>Hildegarde at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>Most of the time Hildegarde is with her young charge, but the Characters may learn that her interest in the unusual (as in the past) takes her to see the @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Fire-Breathers} on Backertag (Day 4). She may decide to see the @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{elephant show} on Backertag after returning from @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina’s} visit to the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya}. Surius is the toast of the Carnival, and though considered a bit of a stick-in-the-mud — especially by her young ‘charge’— Hildegarde would hate to miss out on such a spectacle. </p>\n<p>Like her charge, @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’ Katarina}, Hildegarde is difficult to meet and a chance encounter is almost out of the question. On the few occasions when she is in public by herself, she is accompanied by a couple of palace guards: at the Fire-Eaters, they are bearers as much as bodyguards, carrying a blanket, a small, folding chair, and a picnic basket, and helping her get comfortable before the show starts.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have met her nephew @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl} — or if they happen to be near her rooms in the palace at the right time — they may hear angry voices as he turns up to demand more money from her. She refuses, as she always does; he threatens her with public embarrassment, as he always does; and she relents and gives him a handful of gold, cursing his name as she does so. Whatever the Players may think, though, Bruno is not a good way to make his aunt’s acquaintance: even if they devise some way to make him stop bothering her, mend his ways, and become the most respectable nephew a ducal chaperone could hope to have, she is mortified that the Characters know her family secret, and will never trust them.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Hildegarde does not normally assist with introductions. Knowing her position at the court well, and having had long experience of ambitious young people trying to use her for their own ends, she simply refuses. She will only relent if the Characters can make a convincing case that the introduction is in the best interests of the city, or the Todbringer family, and in that case she makes sure that the introduction is professional in tone rather than social.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/hildegarde-zimperlich.webp","folder":"YbdT1wAfqZmWtR79","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}

{"_id":"aqoGepFk4QsiiGWq","name":"The 'Princess'","content":"<p>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</p>\n<p>‘Princess’ Katarina is very difficult to meet or have an opportunity for a chance encounter. She is escorted in public by a large contingent of Knights Panther and guarded in private by her @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Chaperone}.  If the Characters have befriended @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} the Minstrel, he may invite them to a small, private party, which the ‘Princess’ might attend for a half-hour or so. If Rallane likes a good-looking and cultured Character, he strives to distract the Chaperone’s attention for five minutes to facilitate a conversation. The Character had better have some good lines ready or be a great raconteur! Katarina is easily distracted, but responds well to stimulating conversation or intriguing gossip. </p>\n<p>Some players might think that the best place to approach Katarina is at the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}, but this is not so. The event is formal, and she knows that many eyes are on her; she is introduced to so many people that no one individual really has a chance to make an impression; and there is no opportunity for a private conversation. The best opportunities are at the @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets} and the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}, especially if @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} and her other friends can distract @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde} the Chaperone for a few minutes. Katarina’s visit to the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya} on Backertag to engage in some solitary reflection may also provide an opening.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Katarina won’t introduce anyone to her father, because he is unwell, and should not be disturbed. Likewise, the Characters cannot use her to see @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan}, because @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} has given strict instructions that he should avoid all excitement. If the Characters convince her that they can help her brother, she introduces them to Pavarotti so that he can make the decision. She can introduce the Characters to @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}, especially fellow Elves, and may provide an introduction to @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}. An introduction to @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} is tricky: while Katarina has considerable affection for her chaperone — coupled with a healthy dose of frustration, of course — and would normally be happy to help anyone respectable to make her acquaintance, she worries that taking younger, handsome, and especially male characters to see the chaperone could lead to uncomfortable questions about how they met, and why Hildegarde is only learning about their acquaintance now.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/katarina-todbringer.webp","folder":"9nJ4brecw2MRO3vH","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":500000}}}

Ideally, they should have a good deal of their equipment with them, as they will have no time to go and pick up anything left in their lodgings.</p>\n<p>As they are strolling through a particularly dark and quiet street, the door of a house suddenly bursts open and a young man, dressed only in his night-clothes, rushes out yelling,<em> ‘Help me, someone, please!’</em></p>\n<p>As he catches sight of the party, he turns and races towards them. A large bruise covers one side of his face. As he rushes over, gasping for air, a dark shape appears, silhouetted in the doorway of the house. The man gasps out one last sentence, <em>‘They’ve got my father… Don’t let them take him… Hurry…’</em> before an audible twang comes from the doorway, followed by a much closer thud.</p>\n<p>The unfortunate young man collapses into the arms of one of the Characters (perhaps one who is drawing or who has already drawn a missile weapon of their own), choking and coughing up blood. A crossbow bolt is buried in his back.</p>\n<p>The shooter is a Yellow Fang cultist by the name of Peter Tavelli, ordered to stop Ernest from raising the alarm while Skretth’s minions took his captured father away through an old, forgotten stone passageway that travels into the house through a flagstone in the cellar.</p>\n<p>Tavelli retreats back inside the building and watches the Characters’ reactions through the hall window. The Characters are likely to chase Tavelli into the house, remembering the urgency of the dying man’s last words. If they pursue, Tavelli leads them into a trap in the house before trying to get back to the cellar and the secret passage. If he is caught or cornered, he swallows a capsule of concentrated @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.JbSjlgUdzsl5ok95]{Heartkill} containing four doses of the poison.

{"_id":"bb163r6wfjPKcKgV","name":"Watch the Birdie","content":"<p>About 30 yards away, there is a sudden blur of action. There is a scream and some shouting, and a bird flies away rapidly, with people throwing stones and other improvised missiles at it. Any Character with an appropriate Skill can identify the bird as a magpie. What do the Characters do?</p>\n<h3>Rushing to Help</h3>\n<p> If the Characters hurry to the scene of the activity, they find a distraught, middle-aged woman from whom the bird has just stolen a jewelled hair-pin, or a furious stallholder from whom it has stolen some small but valuable trinket, or some other victim from whom the bird has stolen something small, shiny, and valuable. By the time they reach the scene, the bird is long gone. If the Characters have failed to make the acquaintance of a major NPC, this could be an opportunity to introduce them.</p>\n<h3>Shooting</h3>\n<p>The Characters suffer from the usual –20 penalty for shooting at a Little target. There is time for one round of missile fire from the moment the Characters first see the bird to when it disappears behind a tree or rooftop. The bird is flying fast and fairly low, so the Characters’ shots may endanger bystanders and could cause a panic. In this event, a Watch patrol arrives on the scene in 2d10 rounds, and the party may be charged with causing a breach of the peace. If the Characters manage to bring the bird down, they are able to explain the situation to the Watch and may get away with a warning and perhaps a spot fine of a Crown or two. Otherwise, a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test, bribery, or some other means is needed to avoid a heavier penalty: a fine of 2d10 GCs and the confiscation of their missile weapons.</p>\n<p>If the bird is brought down and the stolen object recovered, the victim offers to pay any fine the Characters may have incurred, and gives them 5 GCs as a reward.</p>\n<h3>Pursuit</h3>\n<p>If the Characters decide to follow the bird, you may make use of the pursuit rules on page 166 of WFRP, though unless they can themselves fly they will not catch the creature, merely keep up with it. The bird has an effective Agility of 33 and a Move of 8. Talents such as Excellent Vision give the usual bonuses. If they manage to keep the bird in sight for 5 successive rounds, they see it fly through a window into the attic of a building several streets away. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) lntelligence</strong> or <strong>Average (+20) Navigation</strong> Test Test is required for the Characters to find the building.</p>\n<p>The building stands a storey taller than those around it, and there is a single door at street level. Going through the door, the Characters find a narrow hallway with doors on either side and a staircase leading upwards. The building is split into apartments, and after two or three landings the Characters reach the door to the attic. The door is locked, but fairly flimsy — a <strong>Challenging (+0) Strength</strong> Test will see it smashed off its hinges.</p>\n<p>Beyond the door is a small attic room furnished with a bed, a table with two chairs, and a small cupboard. A small, wiry, shabbily dressed man of about thirty (Fastric) is sitting on the bed, which is strewn with brightly shining baubles of all descriptions. As the Characters enter the room, a raven takes off in alarm from its perch on the back of a chair and flies out of the window. As soon as he sees that he is outnumbered, the thief surrenders, but he attempts to escape if the opportunity arises.</p>\n<p>If the Characters turn him over to the authorities, they receive a reward of 17 GCs 10/–, this being 10% of the value of the goods recovered. On the other hand, this thief could be useful if the Characters wish to make contact with the city’s underworld. In either case, a reward of 25 Experience Points is appropriate for each character who helps the party discover the operation.</p>\n<h3>Further Possibilities</h3>\n<p>The Characters might witness several aerial robberies over a period of time, all in the same general area, until they decide to take action. They could hear rumours of a bird stealing small items of jewellery on a few occasions, or witness a dispute between a stallholder and a shopper who claims that a trinket on the stall was stolen from them a few days ago. The operation can make a good piece of background noise, to distract the players from the main thread of their adventure and to help create the feeling that things are happening in Middenheim even when their Characters aren't around.</p>","folder":"KXxwxDsLcPhOIK1h","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

Many of the taverns have a reputation for brawling, but there is one above all others that guarantees a fight: the Sullen Knight. Its clientele comprises drunken sailors, menacing protagonists, amateur pugilists, and members of the Hooks and Fish who fancy a quick rumble. Even the noble sons of the League of Karl-Franz are known to visit on occasion. Whenever a fight starts, the clientele are quick to gather about and begin taking bets. Fagnar Laubrich, a strange little man who constantly hangs around the tavern, runs about making odds and taking credit notes. The tavern is also popular with harlots, who find that the bloody pugilists are often in the mood for the comforts they offer after the fighting.</p>\n<p>It is owned and run by Red Marcus who bought it with his earnings as a Pit Fighter. A selection of weapons adorn the wall behind the bar. The place is very rough, as Red encourages brawls, which he himself enjoys joining in. The tavern is frequented by a mixture of labourers, criminals, stevedores and prostitutes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Money talks here and Red is the best person to speak to. He remembers that a couple of &lsquo;nobs&rsquo; (slang for nobility, applied to most middle class people too) were in that night, talking to Ingrid and Lucky Liz. The older man he had seen with Ingrid, before and after the other two left, they had argued. He had returned later that night to talk to &lsquo;Spices&rsquo; Bob and had argued with him too. They had to be pulled apart and the nob threatened Bob. Bob just laughed it off.</p>\n<p>He knows that @JournalEntry[r5aRpbQcKTS8BhF5]{Liz} lives in Eldenstrasse and @JournalEntry[Khul8GAKuonTHzoV]{'Spices' Bob} works in the warehouses by the docks.</p>"}
{"_id":"bbeiTuz6fIj4hObn","name":"The Right Road","content":"<p>The journey to Middenheim is a long one, and involves a perilous crossing of the Drakwald. Our ‘heroes’ may decide that there are more attractive, and safer, opportunities elsewhere, or they may simply have missed all the hints and leads pointing them that way. You can use various means to nudge them in the right direction.</p>\n<h3>Urgent Delivery</h3>\n<p>In ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.p6uoMs09lyIar8qc]{Carrion up the Reik}’, the Characters were hired by Matthias Blucher to deliver a cargo to a Captain Scharlach in Middenheim, and warned that it must arrive by the start of the city’s famous Carnival. They have received an advance on the payment, but can expect nothing else unless they fulfil the contract.</p>\n<p>Acting on orders from Matthias, perhaps a clerk from the Bluchers’ Altdorf office meets their boat when it arrives. He or she asks the Characters about their journey, inspects the cargo (especially the seals), and offers to guide them to the depot of @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.HqarwMVLyiaal4sK]{Castle Rock Coaches}, where tickets have already been booked for the whole party. A number of burly porters (treat them as stevedores, armed with crowbars instead of boat hooks) stand ready to take the crate and the rest of the Characters’ luggage, and have been well paid to make sure that everyone and everything makes it on to the coach.</p>\n<h4>A Cargo for Marienburg</h4>\n<p>If, through some mischance, the Characters have managed to keep both their boat and the supposedly valuable cargo for Marienburg (see ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.Xv6S9PboyVCs9a8h]{Making a Deal}’), and you have not been able to destroy either in a fire at the docks, the Blucher agent inspects the cargo on the wharf and opens one crate to find that it contains nothing but low-grade earthenware, which was intended to be destroyed in the fire that Blucher arranged to damage the Characters’ barge. The Altdorf agent may or may not already know about the deception, but in either case he tells the Characters that there was a mix-up and this cargo is not the one destined for Marienburg. However, he does have an urgent overland delivery for Middenheim, and is prepared to pay well if the Characters deliver it before the city’s Carnival begins.</p>\n<h3>The Trail Of The Purple Hand</h3>\n<p>Since they came across  Kastor Lieberung’s body  in ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.eSfUKiIYJM8nlFmT]{Mistaken Identity}’ in Enemy in Shadows, the Characters have run across the Order of the Purple Hand in Altdorf and Kemperbad. They should have at least one letter (@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.tUuxwr64dr2BqUBC]{Handout 10 from Death on the Reik}), which indicates that the cult’s leadership is in Middenheim, and they should also have formed the impression that until the matter of ‘Kastor Lieberung’ and his inheritance is resolved, the cult will not stop harassing them. Given the cult’s apparent reach, their only hope — slender as it is — may be to go to Middenheim and confront the cult’s leaders. If your group has played through both <strong>Enemy in Shadows</strong> and <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>, you may well find this to be the most expedient method of getting them to Middenheim. The Purple Hand has done much to make enemies of the Characters, and at this point your players may well be champing at the bit to confront the cult directly. If you think this likely, have a Character catch a glimpse of a purple-hooded figure leaving the Blucher offices, or otherwise allow the relationship between the Bluchers and The Purple Hand to become known. A quick interrogation later, and the party should be on its way to Middehiem, intent on confronting one ‘Captain Scharlach’ in person...</p>\n<h3>The Last of the Wittgensteins</h3>\n<p>While in @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.DlryCob4PW1jm9s0]{Castle Wittgenstein}, the Characters may have found a letter to @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.fmUd7AtbJckbiWo6]{Lady Margritte} from her brother @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard}, telling her all about the wonderful time he is having in Middenheim with his fellow Slaanesh worshippers. Of course, the prospect of tracking down one man in a city of thousands seems daunting, and the Characters may need some extra help and encouragement to follow up on this lead.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the trail of the Purple Hand is clear enough, in which case the discovery of Gotthard among Middenheim’s high society can be a surprise — but if the players need an additional incentive to get them to Middenheim, here are some ideas.</p>\n<p>Gotthard’s letter mentions ‘important and influential people flocking to the cause’, which implies that there is a Slaanesh cult in the city with some very high-ranking members. Having seen the temple of Slaanesh in the castle, the Characters may decide to go to Middenheim in order to investigate further.</p>\n<p>It is clear that the whole Wittgenstein family is more or less corrupt. The letter makes it plain that Gotthard is  just as bad and corrupt as @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.fmUd7AtbJckbiWo6]{Lady Margritte}. The mere implication that he is a worshipper of Chaos may be enough for more devout Characters to hunt him down and end the Wittgenstein line once and for all.</p>\n<p>A picture of Gotthard was hanging in Castle Wittgenstein’s @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.1wRb1a5Tku2t0UvL]{portrait room}. In the painting he is wearing a distinctive jewel, which the Characters are certain they would recognise if they saw it again.</p>\n<h3>The Warpstone</h3>\n<p>The Characters have encountered Skaven at least twice during <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>: once at the @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.Byapyp2Y5uE49deo]{Devil’s Bowl}, and a second time when they snatched the Warpstone from @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.dJH6EMHCGKMTsHel]{Castle Wittgenstein} and brought the whole structure down to cover their escape. No adventurers worth their salt forget this kind of frustration, and they may be determined to track the Skaven down and stop whatever they are planning to do.</p>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;transform:scaleX(-1);border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/end-of-wittgenstein.webp\" width=\"269\" height=\"330\" /></p>\n<p>They may rue this decision once they become embroiled in the events of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, but for now their desire for the Warpstone, and their frustration at the loss of it, can be used as a further incentive to direct them to Middenheim. As the Characters make their way toward Kemperbad and Altdorf — or wherever else they may be going — they may hear further rumours from the north. In addition to more reports of anti-Sigmarite atrocities in Middenland, there may be talk of ratmen beneath the city (see @JournalEntry[ri289tDcFl3qOsaT]{‘News and Rumours’}], and perhaps of an unexpected rash of mutations in the city.</p>\n<p>As the Characters discover later, the Skaven who took the warpstone meteorite from Castle Wittgenstein did not go to Middenheim. But for now, they have not heard of Skaven being anywhere else, and that may be enough to convince them to go there.</p>","folder":"9l20ogJKAnhkPnIw","sort":250000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":250000}}}

Gertrude Zahldahl is present.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'Another Pattern Murderer. Every summer seems to bring another of these sick whoresons out of the woodwork. Must be the heat. First it was the Beast murders a few years ago, then it was the Warhawk. And the Runt Render, of course.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gertrude Zahndahl is a middle-ranking official of the Cobbler's Guild. She is weasel faced and thin with no sense of humour.</p>\n<p>She likes lists and reciting them in a tedious monotone. She is an excellent administrator and record keeper, but has neither imagination nor creativity. She is also lacking in observation skills. She was assigned by the Guild to investigate the murders, but Ernst Bl&uuml;cher has lost faith in her and insisted she recruit some proper investigators.</p>\n<h3>Ernst Bl&uuml;cher</h3>\n<p>Ernst Bl&uuml;cher is the final surviving member of the Cobblers&rsquo; Guild in the Docks. He is tall and striking, though getting on in years, now. He still retains youthful vigour from years of contented work at a craft he enjoys. However, the last few days have put strain on him; he is not eating and is nervous and jumpy.</p>\n<p>He has no idea what is going on with these murders but has worked out that he is very likely to be the next victim. He has lost faith in Zahndahl&rsquo;s investigation and is desperate to hire people who look like they know what they&rsquo;re doing. He wants the murders solved, but more than that, he wants people who look like they know one end of a sword from the other to bodyguard him through the night.</p>\n<h3>Meeting Ernst Bl&uuml;cher</h3>\n<p>Zahndahl leads the Characters to &lsquo;Bl&uuml;cher Shoemaker&rsquo; just off the Luitpoldstrasse. The shop is closed but Zahndahl unlocks the door, lets the Characters through quickly, and carefully locks it behind her, and throws a couple of dead bolts for good measure. She calls up to Bl&uuml;cher announcing that &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a lovely day&rsquo; and she has found help. The Characters might notice that there is a door at the back of the shop, leading to an alleyway, but this one is locked and bolted even more heavily than the front door.</p>\n<p>Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s workshop is typical of cobblers from all over the Empire. There is a strong wooden bench, replete with back board holding a comprehensive array of strange tools of all shapes and sizes, all in their allotted place. There are groovers, breakers, fudge wheels, box wheels, channel cutters, welt trimmers, sewing awls, and stamping tools, to name a few.</p>\n<p>There is an assortment of lasts, some with half-made shoes fitting snugly over them and a neat filing system of designs and the details of everyone who has ever had their feet measured at this shop. There is a sheet of leather spread across the table with the odd shape cut from it. And many more sheets, of all qualities and colours, hang from racks. The entire area is permeated with the distinctive, and luxuriant, smell of tanned leather.</p>\n<p>Bl&uuml;cher is not here, however, but he shouts down from above that the Characters should approach the door. In the corner of the workshop, there is a spiral staircase leading up to the next level, at the top of which is a sturdy wooden door. Bl&uuml;cher has locked himself into his living rooms above and is determined to stay there.</p>\n<p>He explains the situation through the door. Occasionally, his words become muffled and difficult to understand as he forgets to shout, but Zahndahl can interject helpfully whenever she thinks something needs clarification.</p>\n<p>It should be conveyed to the Characters that there have been three murders and Bl&uuml;cher is likely to be the fourth victim.</p>\n<p>Bl&uuml;cher and Zahndahl can give a brief outline of the victims and the murders in the hope that the Characters accept the job. The Characters should do all they can to find out who the murderer is as soon as possible, and certainly before Bl&uuml;cher is killed. They are promised a reward of five gold crowns for solving the murders and bringing the perpetrator to justice. Until they earn that sum, however, for every day that the murderer is still at large but Bl&uuml;cher survives, the Characters are promised a bonus of, &lsquo;one gold crown, no strings attached.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>This sum is intended for the Characters collectively, not for each of them. Of course, astute Characters may see an opportunity to bargain their wages up, and any reasonable attempt could result in a doubling of their pay. He does not have the whip hand in any negotiations.</p>\n<p>He wants the Characters to investigate the murders by day but be back there by nightfall in order to protect him throughout the night. All the other murders were carried out overnight, and Bl&uuml;cher imagines any attempt on his life will be as well.</p>\n<h3>Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s Room</h3>\n<p>It is possible that the Characters never meet Bl&uuml;cher face to face, and Zahndahl deals with everything they need. However, it would also be reasonable for the Characters to insist on entering Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s room to check out the security. If they do, Zahndahl remarks that &lsquo;it is a lovely day.&rsquo; Bl&uuml;cher hesitates at this, and then agrees.</p>\n<p>He can explain that he is happy to open the door occasionally if Zahndahl is on her own, &lsquo;and she says everything is fine.&rsquo; In fact, Bl&uuml;cher and Zahndahl have worked out a code. If either of them says &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a lovely day&rsquo; then the other will know they consider it safe. If they say it&rsquo;s raining (or any other type of inclement weather) they convey that there is danger. They probably won&rsquo;t explain this to the Characters, unless they notice something about the interaction and ask about it. The Characters should be left to try to work it out for themselves if they need to because it may come in handy later. If the Characters need Bl&uuml;cher to open the door during the adventure, and Zahndahl is not present, then Bl&uuml;cher is likely to ask the Characters what the weather&rsquo;s like, and it probably won&rsquo;t be a lovely day when he asks!</p>\n<p>Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s living quarters are in darkness save for a couple of candles. He has just moved in a load of supplies to last during, what he hopes might be, a long stay. These are piled up in the middle of the room and include lots of preserved food, bottles of wine, two brace of pistols and a whole barrel of gunpowder.</p>\n<p>Looking around the room, it seems secure enough. He has closed all the shutters and barred them. The door has a decent lock, and Bl&uuml;cher has had three hefty bolts installed. It&rsquo;s hard to think of any other way someone could gain entry.</p>\n<p>You should probably not mention the fireplace unless the Characters express their interest in it. It is the normal sort of fireplace for an upstairs room in Altdorf, with a small fire, and a narrow vent allowing only the smallest child-sweep access.</p>\n<p>Unless the Characters do something about this, this is where the assassins will enter his room this evening.</p>\n<h3>Investigating</h3>\n<p>The Characters do not have a lot to go on at this stage. They can go and visit the various scenes of the previous crimes, or merely listen to Zahndahl&rsquo;s accounts of them. Zahndahl does her best to tell everything she thinks might be relevant, and she is largely successful, but her monotonous drone and tedious litany could get boring quite fast. However, she has missed the odd clue, so if the Characters are to find them they must visit the crime scenes themselves.</p>\n<p>They may also have questions about Bl&uuml;cher himself, which Zahndahl should do her best to answer. It would suit the adventure to leave the Characters in little doubt that Bl&uuml;cher has no real enemies and has done no real harm to anyone.</p>\n<p>Zahndahl&rsquo;s role in the adventure is really to make things easier and quicker for the Characters. She has been on the case for a few days before the Characters are recruited. She has acquired many of the facts of the other murders and has diligently questioned all the witnesses she thought relevant.</p>\n<p>She can give the Characters some official clout and access to areas that may be loath to accept a bunch of adventurers. She also has a lot of the information about the murders that she can supply more or less accurately when asked. She lacks the imagination to help with solving the case, however; that is the Characters&rsquo; job, after all.</p>\n<p>She has been given a warrant by the Town Council that is supposed to give her free and unhindered access anywhere in the city. In practice, however, it only has influence within the guilds of Altdorf themselves, and sometimes among disinterested parties. Anyone outside of a guild or the council wishing to ignore the warrant could do so for several days, or even weeks, even if the guild did eventually decide to follow this up legally.</p>"}

In past years, the event has seen some very dark escapades, including the mock public execution of a Bretonnian merchant for dropping litter. Unfortunately, as the executioner sharpened his axe (a dummy affair made of <em>crystal-sugar</em>), the poor man died of fright! This year marks the return of an old favourite: the ‘Pickpocket Gag’.</p>\n<p>The ‘pickpocket’ selects a victim from the crowd, then  making it obvious that he or she has just stolen something, runs off, usually with the victim in hot pursuit. The chase ends in the @JournalEntry[asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials} (location 3) where the item is returned as the crowd cheers and jeers. It is rare for the pickpocket to be caught, since only fast and nimble young citizens are chosen (with Dodge skill scores of 55 and Talents such as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.jrFIFLhyOYwcyMUl]{Flee!}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.E3vTSCzgrasNijUO]{Fleet-Footed} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.BbStIySkF1hDM2zq]{Lightning Reflexes}).</p>\n<p>By tradition, the pickpocket is dressed in a brightly-coloured costume; this ensures that pursuers will not lose sight of him or her, and that Middenheimers will recognise the pickpocket and make way, joining in the fun by tripping up the victim and getting in the way. If the pickpocket is caught, the Watch is called. In the past, this has resulted in the pickpocket being released on the grounds that it is a ‘first offence.’ Only when the victim reaches an apoplectic rage is the joke revealed.</p>\n<p>If a player character is chosen as a victim for this event, run the chase according to the @JournalEntry[SRetBgvMulRRIQQq]{rules}, but whatever the Character rolls for movement, assume that the pickpocket rolls the same or better.</p>\n<h3>Song of Middenheim: Yokel Baiting</h3>\n<p>Not to be forgotten is the yearly institution of ritual humiliation the city inflicts upon some visitor- the fun and joy of Yokel Baiting!  Always this is an elaborate series of practical jokes that take place ONLY on the first day and are targeted against anyone new to the city.  No one knows who organises such things, just that they have always been organised.</p>\n<p>Celebrating the return of the long lost cousin...</p>\n<p>Each year the prank differs.  Mock arrests and sentences of death for littering are fun; so is ‘The Long Lost Cousin’.  Indeed so popular is Long Lost Cousin there are a range of variations (Long Lost brother/Sister/Grandfather for example, and also “The Man who saved my life’).  What happens is simply- some poor visitor is approached by someone who swears blind he/she is their long lost cousin.  They will call them by some name (for females they are ALWAYS called Hilda, for men, they are ALWAYS called Fred (short for Frederick)), and the poor victim is introduced to the strangers friends and family.  And nearby people.  Who then make a big show of going “By Ulric!  It’s Fred!  I have not seen you in YEARS...”No matter what the victim says, they will be the Long Lost Cousin and EVERYONE goes along with it.  People remind the cousin of great parties they went to, others hand them a ‘those two crowns I owed you from years ago, remember?’ and so forth.  No matter what the victim says they will be treated as the Long Lost Cousin for a few hours.</p>\n<p>What makes it funnier is Middenheimers like to raise the stakes- a disheveled woman turns up with small starving children and demand why Fred, her husband abandoned her all those years ago... the Watch turn up as Fred is wanted for murder and treason... as they lead Fred to the Watch Barracks a contingent of White Wolf knights turn up with a warrant for Fred’s arrest for heresy...</p>\n<p>As they are led suddenly the mob of locals, knowing what the joke is, will line the streets and scream out condemnations against Fred, and women will swear blind Fred molested them (if they are picking on Hilda, the tradition is for men to shout about her prowess in bed with as much detail as possible).</p>\n<p>Then, just as quick as it starts it ends, with those nearby laughing and allowing Fred/Hilda go about their traumatised way...</p>\n<p>Yokel baiting changes each year and will gather as many victims as possible.  It’s all good fun and Middenheimer's are use to seeing terrified Stirlanders fleeing through the streets with dozens of nubile young Middenheim girls chasing them screaming \"Put a baby in my belly...\" on that day and tend not to bat an eyelid...</p>\n<h3>The Troll Slayer</h3>\n<p>This incident can be set in any public place. If the Characters need some help in locating the source of @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Sparsam’s} addiction, it can give them a chance to find out about @JournalEntry[mNMoXXZJKYGjXH7O]{the Pit}.</p>\n<p>The Characters see a tattooed Dwarf with orange-dyed hair heading towards them. He walks in a straight line, with the crowd parting fearfully round him. As he approaches, the Characters may notice on a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test that he seems unusually agitated, even for a Troll Slayer. His facial muscles are contorted in a strange spasm, and his bulging eyes seem unnaturally bright. If the Characters move to one side, the Dwarf walks on without pause. If his path is blocked, he stops and stares at whomever is in the way. After a moment, he stretches his muscles, and hefts his axe in a warning manner. Even under the influence, Glugnar will not attack an unarmed person — however, if the Characters decide to draw their own weapons or attack first, the Troll Slayer will be only too pleased to oblige them with a fight.</p>\n<p>@Actor[7qgDlG8BryDHpn4a]{Glugnur - the Troll Slayer}</p>\n<p>Glugnur is in Middenheim to take part in the @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}, so this encounter might take place near the @JournalEntry[eM2ZiVNgS7dzI2bA]{Bernabau Stadium}. While affected by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald's Delight}, he is happy to fight anyone who gets in his way — including a fellow Dwarf. However, should a Dwarf show proper respect, and move aside, Glugnur will greet him as a brother, and invite him to celebrate in style. The stimulant has given Glugnur a tremendous appetite, and he is about to embark on an eating binge. After the binge the dose wears off, forcing Glugnur to sleep for the next 12  hours. If asked about the source, Glugnur simply says ‘the Pit,’ and continues eating.</p>\n<h3>The Protection Racket</h3>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;transform:scaleX(-1);border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-shakedown.webp\" width=\"375\" height=\"565\" /></p>\n<p>This encounter can be set in any commercial or market area which is not far from lower-class areas, the slums or the Old Quarter. As the Characters turn a corner, they see a small market stall kicked over by two brutish young men in leather jerkins. The elderly pedlar and his wife shake with fear as the thugs advance, brandishing clubs: they have refused to pay protection money, and are about to suffer the consequences.</p>\n<h3>The Victims</h3>\n<p>Victims are an unfortunately common class of person in The Empire, especially during Carnivals and other events that draw out a crowd. Gustav and Hildi, below, are quite unexceptional, except in the unwanted attention they have drawn.</p>\n<p>@Actor[swyabCA6Zxh16jw1]{Gustav Holschtweig}</p>\n<p>@Actor[YWqaDFC1SFXjTNYL]{Hildi Holschtweig}</p>\n<h3>The Thugs</h3>\n<p>Equally as unexceptional are Anton and Bruno, who make their money shaking down unwary vendors, wayward travellers, and anyone else who seems to be a likely target.</p>\n<p>@Actor[IUWpCVVM1IishjiP]{Antonia Fiegling}</p>\n<p>@Actor[OTkq0jLTBOWVhYBb]{Bruno Hansgorp}</p>\n<p>If the Characters threaten Antonia and Bruno, they laugh humourlessly, then Antonia strikes Gustav in the face. If the Characters do nothing, the thugs beat Gustav up, and then search for money. If the Characters attack, Antonia and Bruno defend themselves, but flee if reduced to 3 wounds or less.</p>\n<p>The merchants will be deeply grateful for the Characters’ help. The crowd will applaud, and look rather shame-faced. If one (or more) of the Characters gives some money to the merchants to recompense them for damage done to their goods, you should consider making an extra, individual experience point award.</p>\n<p>A Watch patrol arrives some 5–10 minutes after the fracas, and takes statements from all concerned. If the thugs have been killed, the Watch is  suspicious of the Characters, but testimony from @Actor[swyabCA6Zxh16jw1]{Gustav} and other witnesses clear their names. However, the sergeant warns the Characters to watch their step for the rest of their stay in Middenheim — not that they want to discourage public-spirited actions, but it would be better if criminals are caught rather than killed. In any event, the action will be reported to @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Commander Schutzmann}. When the Watchmen have departed, Gustav insists on buying a meal for the Characters, leaving @Actor[YWqaDFC1SFXjTNYL]{Hildi} in charge of the stall. He takes them to an average standard inn (prices as @JournalEntry[ieHrUyFz83TkBikg]{The Templar’s Arms}).</p>\n<p>If the thugs escape, the party might be in for a surprise a few days later. With four accomplices, @Actor[IUWpCVVM1IishjiP]{Antonia} and @Actor[OTkq0jLTBOWVhYBb]{Bruno} arrange an ambush in some dark alley. All the thugs wear masks. By this time, the Characters may be deeply involved in the main plot, and assume that the attack has another motive altogether.</p>\n<h3>The Street Brats</h3>\n<p>While walking through a busy market-place, the Characters hear a cry of, ‘Stop, thief !’ Looking round, they see a street-urchin running towards them. Behind is a Halfling pie-seller, intent on recovering a pie that the lad has just stolen. A few yards from the party the urchin trips, tumbling into one of the Characters. He bounces to his feet, but by then the Halfling has caught up.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<p>‘Wot’s the matter wiv you, mister? (or lady),’ <em>says the lad calmly, taking a bite out of the pie to render it unrecoverable</em>. ‘My mates ’ere’ll pay for the pie.’ <em>He looks significantly up at the party, ready to bolt if they refuse. </em>‘Name’s Karl,’ <em>he says</em>. ‘Pleased t’meetcha.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the party sides with Karl, they gain a useful ally. An acute observer, he quickly realises that they are Characters, new to town. He plays up to them, flattering their vanity, and feigning great awe, while pointing out that he could be extremely useful: ‘Fanks, guv’nor, ye’r a gent. Anyfink I can do in return? Show you the sights, p’raps?”</p>\n<p>As Karl explains, he would happily work for nothing, but he has to support his four friends: Uli Muller, Gunnar Kammerer, Carina Adenauer, and Claudia Dietz — <em>‘After all, they depends on me, see? Gotter look out fer yer own.’</em></p>\n<p>All are shabbily-dressed orphans, with profiles similar to Karl’s, and a similar range of basic Skills. They are observant and cunning, and could be very useful as spies and errand-runners. If the players don’t think of this, have Karl drop a few hints: ‘Anyfink you need to know, guv’nor, look no further. It’s mazin’ wot a bit o’ silver does fer the eyesight an’ memory.’ <strong>Note</strong>: they would stand out like a sore thumb in any well-to-do area. ( Karl will point this out if necessary — with the air of one explaining to a very small child.) </p>\n<p>However, they do know a great many servants, labourers, bar staff and the like. They are a close-knit group, and work together or not at all.</p>\n<p>Their services are not expensive; they will ask for @Pay[3bp]{3 brass pennies} each per day, but can be bargained down to @Pay[1bp]{1}. They will, however, claim extra fees, if they report something which clearly interests the party. Karl insists on payment in silver — if offered gold, he will say, <em>‘D’yer fink yer could break that inter small change fer me, guv’nor? Wouldn’t want anyone finking I’d pinched it.’</em></p>\n<p>If the Characters hire Karl and his friends, you can determine what information they can supply to advance the adventure. If the party simply hands Karl over to the Halfling, a few sling-stones might come their way at a later time.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-shakedown.webp","folder":"KyRXwOjQ3W4XV30X","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 5: The Carnival","sort":165625}}}

If the party becomes involved in some small fracas — in one of the better parts of town, of course — the Knight Eternal may intercede. Most thugs flee when he appears, even those hired by another major NPC to ambush the Characters. If they suspect that the encounter has been staged by the Knight Eternal, a few minutes of conversation should convince them this cannot possibly be cunning… could he?</p>\n<p>The key to Siegfried’s good graces is his naïve vanity. If the Characters are, or can pretend to be, impressed by his position, devoted to the ideals of chivalry, and sufficiently well-born to merit his attention, they can flatter him into almost complete pliability. This of course, leads most of the other major NPCs to regard the Characters with a level of contempt similar to their low opinion of the Knight himself. They will quickly discover that he has no friends, very little influence, and absolutely no knowledge of value. He is also about the most irritating person with whom one could ever hope to spend an evening.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: If sufficiently flattered and manipulated, Siegfried happily demonstrates his position and influence — or rather, the position and influence that exist only in his own imagination — by furnishing the Characters with florid but beautifully-scribed letters of introduction to anyone in the city.

However, anyone presenting such letters to another major NPC starts off with a –20 penalty to all <strong>Fellowship </strong>Tests in the first interview, being tainted by association with this overblown fop. @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Zimperlich} the Chaperone is the only exception.

{"_id":"cGM170eBv0xxR1aU","name":"Going To Market","content":"<p>Once you start play, the availability of rarer goods is restricted. After all, it’s hard to find a harpsichord in a five-house hamlet, but not so hard in the shops and markets of imperial capital, Altdorf.</p>\n<p>The following rules for buying and selling are all optional. The GM may prefer to roleplay every visit to each market, hawker, or shop, meaning Tests for Availability are unrequired as the GM simply states what is or isn’t purchasable. Equally, the GM may prefer you to simply check the trapping lists, roll for Availability and, if the Test succeeds, spend the coin on whatever you want. Possibly without even Haggling!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Tracking Money</em></h3>\n<p><em>Where some groups like to track every penny closely, perhaps even using chits or fantasy coins to represent in-game coins, others prefer to ignore all fiscal book-keeping. The game rules assume you are counting every coin, but if you wish to simplify money, you can do so using your Status. If an item costs less than your Status level — so if you have a Status of Silver 2, any item costing 2 silver shillings or less — you are assumed to be able to buy as much as needed of that item. Beyond that, you can buy a maximum of one item a day that costs more with a Haggle Test, with the difficulty set by the GM according to the cost of the item and the local markets.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Availability</h3>\n<p>All Trappings have an Availability, either Common, Scarce, Rare, or Exotic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Common items are found in almost every corner of the Empire and are always assumed to be readily available.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Scarce and Rare items are less common, and you need to pass an Availability Test to find any locally in stock; the chance of passing the Test depends upon the settlement size.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Exotic items are super rare, and only available if the GM says so, or if you commission the item from an appropriate artisan (perhaps with a @JournalEntry[Commission] Endeavour), or make it yourself (perhaps with a @JournalEntry[Crafting] Endeavour.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>Once you know an item's availability, you can use the `/avail` command to test if it's in stock. For example, `/avail Village Rare`. Otherwise, the item's availability can be tested by posting the item to chat.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you fail an Availability Test for Scarce or Rare items, you can either reroll when you arrive at a new settlement or you can try again next week if the settlement is Town-size or larger.</p>\n<p>If an item is in stock, it’s up to the GM to determine how many are available. As a general rule-of-thumb, villages have a single item in stock, towns have [[/r 1d10]] items, and cities have as many as the GM deems appropriate. These quantities are generally doubled for Common items, and halved for Rare ones (rounding up).</p>\n<h3>Bargaining and Trading</h3>\n<p>People of the Empire love a good bargain, and crowds of eager shoppers fill town squares every day looking for the best deals. When buying goods, there are two primary Skills to Test: Evaluate and Haggle.</p>\n<p>Evaluate is used by consumers to identify the quality of an item. Similarly, the vendor can use Evaluate to appraise coins for their exchange value, or spot counterfeits. Anyone can also use Evaluate to estimate the prices of Rare or Exotic items to within +/-10%.</p>\n<p>Haggle is used routinely by consumers and vendors alike, typically with Opposed Tests. Haggling is expected and most prices are marked up slightly to account for this. Winning a Haggle Test reduces the price by 10% (or possibly up to 20% with an Astounding Success (6+) or with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.epPBu7x6BRWp2PHG]{Dealmaker} Talent). Failing a Haggle contest badly usually means the vendor distrusts your coinage.</p>\n<h4>Roleplaying Shopping Trips</h4>\n<p>Trips to the market for routine purchases don’t need to be roleplayed in detail. The GM might prefer you browse the equipment lists and check for Availability yourself. Major purchases that involve item Craftsmanship, or require extra Haggling, can be fun to roleplay in-character. In certain scenarios, shopkeepers are important NPCs with distinct personalities or story roles, so it’s always worth interacting with them. Consider the following when roleplaying shopping:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The GM may overrule Availability as dictated by local details. For example, basic rowboats are automatically available if the adventure is located in a fishing village that features a renowned boat-builder.</li>\n<li>Availability percentages can be increased by +10% or +20%if a character is especially diligent, belongs to a relevant career such as Merchant or Fence, or spends an entire day shopping and making Gossip Tests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Selling</h3>\n<p>Selling your trappings during desperate times, or simply offloading loot, is handled in exactly the same fashion as Buying, but this time you’ll be making money, not spending it. So, you first check for Availability of a buyer in the same fashion as checking for stock. You then bargain and trade, with Evaluate Tests and Haggle Tests as the GM prefers, and finally you set a price. Typically, the base cost when selling is half the item’s listed price, meaning, when selling second-hand, you usually make between a quarter to half an item’s worth after Haggling.</p>\n<p>If you have a Career like fence or merchant, and you put time into Gossip Tests and wandering the local town, you might find someone willing to pay up to 80% of the item’s listed value, though that is left in the hands of the GM.</p>\n<h4>Lowering the Price</h4>\n<p>If you can’t find a buyer, you can try lowering the price. Each time you half the money you are willing to accept, the Availability of a buyer increases by one step.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Corporal Mauser has fled his State Army regiment with a Hochland Longrifle he stole, and is keen to sell. As it’s an Exotic item, there are no immediate buyers he can find on the street. The GM determines the base price Mauser can expect is half the weapon’s value (so 50GC, half of the 100GC it’s worth), so Mauser decides to drop the price by half two times, saying he will accept 12GC 10/–, which increases the Availability of a Buyer two steps from Exotic to Scarce.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Bartering</h3>\n<p>Rural and mercantile commerce often involves trading one commodity for another without exchanging money. To resolve bartering of this type, compare the Availability of the items being traded against those being acquired. The barter ratio indicates how many ‘units’ must be traded, and how many ‘units’ of the other commodity are acquired. ‘Units’ are defined by checking the equipment list prices of both items and grouping them into packages of roughly equivalent value.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Bartering Ratios</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 460px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Traded Items</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">Scare</td>\n<td style=\"width: 79px; text-align: center;\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"width: 88px; text-align: center;\">Exotic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99px; text-align: center;\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">2:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 79px; text-align: center;\">4:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 88px; text-align: center;\">8:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99px; text-align: center;\">Scarce</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 79px; text-align: center;\">2:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 88px; text-align: center;\">4:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99px; text-align: center;\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 79px; text-align: center;\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 88px; text-align: center;\">2:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99px; text-align: center;\">Exotic</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 79px; text-align: center;\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 88px; text-align: center;\">1:1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":"1salsrflGffgtAKj","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Money"}}}

{"_id":"dCsWSFaugK8jTpoW","name":"Initial Inquiries: Religion","content":"<p>Having heard various rumours on the way to Middenheim, the Characters may well try to learn more about the growing tension between the cults of Sigmar and Ulric.</p>\n<h3>The Sigmarian Heresy</h3>\n<p>Every Middenheimer, and almost everyone in Middenland and the north, has at least heard of the heresy — or as most Ulricans call it, ‘the controversy’. Put simply and shockingly, it proposes that Sigmar’s divinity is second to Ulric’s — if it even exists at all! They argue strongly that Sigmar was mortal and only became Emperor with the Ar-Ulric’s  blessing. It was only after his disappearance that Sigmar became a god. They conclude from this that Sigmar is less divine than Ulric, more of a warrior saint than a true god.</p>\n<p>Theologians have grappled with this conundrum for centuries, with many heated debates at various councils (in particular, the Council of Nuln and the Council of Tilea): warrior saint, demigod, or deity? Until recently it was regarded more as an exercise in logic — a paradox for students and initiates to study — than as a serious indictment of the Empire’s most powerful religion. But now, a growing and vocal faction of fundamentalist Ulricans has begun to embrace it, claiming that it calls into question the legitimacy of the Emperor’s rule, and that of all Sigmar’s successors.</p>\n<h3>The Sons of Ulric</h3>\n<p>The @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{Sons of Ulric} are a loose and disorganised confederation of religious fanatics, northern separatists, bigots, and thugs bound together by the common belief that a blood descendant of Ulric ought to lead the official cult. It is no surprise then to learn that many prominent Sons of Ulric go so far as to claim to be blood descendants of Ulric themselves, and invoke their supposed ancestry to justify acts of sedition and violence. The group has no overall leader, central organisation, or coherent agenda.</p>\n<p>There have been a number of activities attributed to the Sons of Ulric, including calls for the north to separate from the more Sigmarite south, breaking the Empire into two separate nations. Discrimination against followers of Sigmar ranging from refusing to do business with them to attacks on their temples, homes, and persons is on the increase. Other factors that add to the rising tensions are advocating for laws and taxes that target followers of Sigmar specifically; civil disobedience toward officials from Altdorf; and blaming them for any crime, disaster, or public mishap. They have little love for the official cult, saying that it is weak and that Ar-Ulric ought to be chosen from their own ranks.</p>\n<p>Ar-Ulric has publicly called for calm and tolerance, and the group is technically banned from holding assemblies in Middenheim, but he has stopped short of criticising the group’s anti-Sigmarite stance — something that followers of Sigmar see as significant. The Graf has condemned the growing lawlessness and violence, and has increased taxes to pay for more watchmen, but he has not disavowed the Sons of Ulric or taken any action against them specifically.</p>\n<h3>The Grand Theogonist</h3>\n<p>A few weeks ago the @Actor[Grand Theogonist], the leader of the Sigmarite faith, visited Middenheim for talks with the Graf and Ar-Ulric. Although this is not unprecedented in itself, he was accompanied by a much larger escort than usual, which included witch hunters as well as Templars of the Fiery Heart.</p>\n<p>The Characters may have encountered the Grand Theogonist and his entourage on the road, and have probably  heard of the recent activities of Sigmarite witch hunters in the city. The presence of such a strong force, and the witch hunters’ high-handed actions, caused considerable tension; although a strong Watch presence was able to prevent riots. Sons of Ulric have criticised the Graf for meekly allowing this Sigmarite force to enter the city freely and do as it pleased.</p>\n<p>Followers of Sigmar are more conciliatory. They are grateful to the Grand Theogonist for coming to Middenheim, and to the Graf and Ar-Ulric for meeting with him. Although no official statements have been made about their discussions, the leaders of Middenheim’s Sigmarite community still hope for a peaceful resolution to the growing religious tensions — though some less optimistic souls are packing up and heading south toward Altdorf, counting their blessings (Sigmar’s or Ulric’s) to be free of whatever reckoning is certain to visit Middenehim soon.</p>\n<h3>North And South</h3>\n<p>The religious tensions have a significant regional dimension, going back to the tribes that Sigmar united to create the Empire, more than twenty-five hundred years ago. The cult of Ulric is the most powerful religion in the northern provinces, which were the territory of the Teutognens. Sigmar’s faith is strongest in the southern homeland of his Unberogen tribe, centred on Altdorf and the Reikland.</p>\n<p>If they are Reiklanders, the Characters — the Humans in the party, at least — have almost certainly grown up with a degree of suspicion regarding those from other provinces. In Middenheim, they discover that they themselves are outsiders, and regarded with suspicion. It quickly becomes apparent to them that the Sons of Ulric are using regional differences as well as religious ones to justify their activities.</p>\n<p>Even those Middenheimers who do not agree with the rhetoric and violence of the @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{Sons of Ulric} may privately admit that they may have a point when it comes to the question of north versus south. They may point out that there are many differences beside religion: northerners are hardier and less flighty than southerners; northern culture places more emphasis on personal integrity while southerners seem to regard profits as a legitimate justification for anything.</p>\n<p>All of this, of course, is thinly disguised regional prejudice, which every Middenlander has to some degree, even if they are not consciously aware of it. If pressed, a great many Middenheimers admit that they would prefer for the Emperor to rule the south and @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} the north as co-regents. But a vocal minority claims that complete separation from the Empire would save the north so much in taxes that everyone would enjoy unprecedented prosperity, including the @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{Sons of Ulric}.  </p>\n<h3>Refugees And Atrocities</h3>\n<p>The followers of Ulric and Sigmar have very different views on this subject, as might be expected. Most Ulricans believe that the reports of attacks on Sigmarites in Middenheim have been exaggerated, if not completely fabricated. @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{The Sons of Ulric} maintain that they are lies spread by agents of the Emperor to justify a planned invasion of the north. The ultimate goal  of this planned invasion is to replace the Graf with an @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.S7O7WxLJKfgPvnZW]{Imperial Plenipotentiary} from Altdorf in the role of viceroy, abolishing the post of Elector Count and bringing Middenland — and ultimately, the whole of the north — under the direct rule of an Emperor who would be accountable to no one.</p>\n<p>While most Middenheimers believe that the numbers of Sigmarite refugees fleeing Middenland have also been exaggerated, some think the count may be accurate, and even take pleasure in the thought that these ‘southerners’ — for all that many are Middenheim born and bred — are leaving the city to the true Ulricans who belong there.</p>\n<p>By contrast, every Sigmarite in Middenheim has a story to tell. Some, especially those who have come from out of town for the Carnival, report no more than occasional rudeness or jostling. But resident Sigmarites disagree with this entirely. They have either experienced discrimination or violence directly, or know someone who has. Tavern brawls and back-alley beatings have escalated to bricks through windows and daubed slogans; one or two suspicious fires have broken out in Sigmarite-owned homes and businesses; and everyone knows at least one family that has packed up and moved south.</p>\n<h3>A Dark Motive</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{The Temple Tax} and the tax on priests entering the city have the greatest impact on the city’s religious community, and @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} has made sure that @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} supports them.</p>\n<p>The followers of other gods are outraged, and there are rumours — especially among the city’s Sigmarite community — that Ar-Ulric not only supports the taxes but suggested them, as part of an organised effort to force other religions out of the city: his cult has amassed great wealth from the city’s faithful and visiting pilgrims, and can outlast any of the others.</p>\n<p>If the taxes are another weapon in the growing religious strife, then the Graf must be in favour of the suppression of other religions. It seems possible that they may be a prelude to other measures against Sigmar and Altdorf, culminating in the outright secession of Middenheim, Middenland, and much of the north. The Characters cannot be sure until they know more, but with the stakes potentially so high, they must find out the truth.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">'RESTORING THE NORTH’ </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">OR ‘TAKING BACK CONTROL’</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">A vocal minority state that in order to make Middenheim glorious again, the following need to be addressed. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">The burdensome regulations on trade cost the north a fortune </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">in lost business.<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Altdorf places the interests of the south, and the Reikland in </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">particular, over those of the rest of the Empire.<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Customs charges on luxury goods from the south would </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">generate enormous revenue while not affecting the average northerner at all, enabling the Graf to lower Middenheim’s taxes to almost nothing.<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Southerners and those of foreign lands in general, are </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">flooding into the north at an unprecedented rate, taking jobs, forcing housing prices up, and dominating commerce to an extent that wil soon reduce true-born Middenheimers to an underclass in their own city.<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">The controversial new taxes are only necessary because the Graf has to send so much money to Altdorf in taxes.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wolf-hole-shrine.webp\" width=\"616\" height=\"486\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wolf-hole-shrine.webp","folder":"Evbhh3cOQ21VdDSM","sort":525000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 4: Initial Inquiries","sort":525000}}}

Those on the wayside throw flowers on the cultists as they progress and offer water for those that fall during the journey.</p>\n<p><em>Mortifaction - Prayer to remove corruption point - for the next adventure if you take damage to the body, gain a bleeding condition.</em></p>\n<h4>Sigmartag (<em>18th Sigmarzeit</em>)</h4>\n<p>The festival of&nbsp;Sigmartag&nbsp;celebrates&nbsp;Sigmar's&nbsp;ascension to the heavens as a&nbsp;god.

{"_id":"dl8tLDuq7t9jqeDI","name":"Advantage","content":"<h3>Advantage In Large Combats</h3>\n<p>The Advantage system works well when there are only a handful of combatants, but it quickly becomes unmanageable when there are ten or more Characters and Creatures all fighting together. In such situations, here are two approaches that work well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert multiple Creatures into a Swarm. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.E2Es82TvBKa7CoDG]{Swarm} rules are purposefully vague enough that they can be applied to any group of combatants, whether they are actually swarming creatures like rats, or just a rabble of peasants. Two Swarms of Clanrats backed up by a single Rat Ogre is a much more manageable encounter than managing 20 Clanrats individually.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Use Group Advantage. When there are multiple combatants working together as a group, you may abstract their Advantage into one single pool of Advantage that they all use. When you do this, generate Advantage as normal, but with a limit of Initiative Bonus gained per Round of combat, regardless of the source. Additionally, whenever a member of the group would lose all of their Advantage, the group loses 2 instead, keeping the remainder.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: The Characters are fighting six Goblins, and the GM decides to use Group Advantage. The Goblins have an Initiative Bonus of 2, so can generate a maximum of 2 Advantage as a group per Round. On the first Round, three of the Goblins charge the Characters. Normally, each would generate 1 Advantage, but instead, they generate 3 Advantage for the group, which drops down to 2 given their Initiative Bonus. Any additional Advantage gained this Round by any of the Goblins won&rsquo;t be counted, but now they all benefit from a +20 to all relevant Tests. On the following Round, after gaining +2 more Advantage as a group, one of the Goblins is defeated in an Opposed Melee Test. Normally that Goblin would lose all of their Advantage, but because they are in a group, the group merely loses 2 Advantage, and retains the rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Removing Advantage</h3>\n<p>Whilst it&rsquo;s great when you have Advantage on your side, the tables can turn very quickly in WFRP, and before you know it, your opponents have built up deadly momentum. When overwhelming Advantage is accrued, it can seem impossible to overcome it. Here are three broad tips for removing Advantage.</p>\n<h4>Ranged Combatants</h4>\n<p>Ranged attacks cannot be Opposed unless performed at Point Blank Range or the target wields a shield, which means that no amount of Advantage will help a Character avoid losing Wounds! Make sure to place a few Creatures with ranged attacks in Combat scenes, and have them target the Characters who are building momentum the most. However, keep in mind that because ranged attacks aren&rsquo;t Opposed, successfully hitting an opponent with a ranged attack doesn&rsquo;t generate Advantage.</p>\n<h4>Passive Damage</h4>\n<p>Passive Damage is any source of Wound loss that isn&rsquo;t defended against, such as from the Ablaze, Bleeding, or Poisoned Conditions. Whilst some of these Conditions would involve Tests where Advantage would be relevant (such as dodging a thrown Incendiary, or parrying a poisoned blade) there are other ways to inflict these Conditions: employ the terrain, use Long Range, or target a Character&rsquo;s non-combat Skills, such as Endurance.</p>\n<h4>Retreat</h4>\n<p>Remember that a combatant loses 1 Advantage per Round if they failed to accrue any extra Advantage during that Round, or they end the Round outnumbered. Which means, if things are going badly for a combatant, they should try to put distance between themselves and their potential killer. Fleeing is one option, but it&rsquo;s not the only one. Consider the location where the Combat is taking place, and see if there are any ways to create barriers between combatants &mdash; throwing tables and chairs in the way, setting the ground on fire, and cutting the ropes suspending a bridge, are just a few examples.</p>\n<p>With a bit of creativity, and by thinking about the Scene where the Combat takes place, you and your Players can use Advantage as an inspiring feature of the system, rather than a snowballing problem to overcome. Remember that, whilst the Characters in the story wouldn&rsquo;t call it Advantage, they would be aware of momentum in a fight, and would try to be creative on the battlefield themselves to mitigate bad odds.</p>\n<h3>Creatures Without the Weapon Trait</h3>\n<p>Some Creatures such as the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.FmEDHnfAe2iIugpt]{Bog Octopus} in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay or the <em>Young Stirpike</em> in <strong>Ubersreik Adventures: If Looks Could Kill</strong> lack a Weapon Creature Trait, but have in its place the Bite, Tail, Tentacles, Vomit, and other such Traits that use Advantage as a cost. These Traits, without the Weapon Trait, mean that the Creature can&rsquo;t perform normal attacks, and must use their special attacks if they want to defeat an opponent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is entirely intentional, and allows these Creatures to be played in truly unorthodox ways, which encourages more dynamic Combat. You should consider the full range of methods for gaining @JournalEntry[Advantage] to aid in these situations. Charging, for example, is a good tactic to use when immediately followed by a Bite. Also remember that larger Creatures do not need to Disengage, so they may Charge, Bite, and move away freely.</p>","folder":"5lgcrfb3I58JxD8Y","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"}}}

{"_id":"e6q8f3mlSXPDlywZ","name":"Henri-Phillippe Rocheteau","content":"<h2>Henri-Philippe Rocheteau</h2>\n<p>Henri-Philippe is a large, stoutly built 42-year-old man, with an olive complexion and shoulder-length black hair. A decade of good living has made him slightly overweight but he still enjoys robust health.</p>\n<p>Originally a wine merchant from Breton, Henri-Phillippe visited the area on business and recognised the excellent potential of soil and climate for cultivating a Bretonnian grape. With borrowed money Henri-Philippe purchased a substantial amount of land from the locals (at a fair price) and settled in the area 14 years ago.</p>\n<p>These locals now work the land as tenant farmers. The new vine soon got established and, having paid off the initial loan, HenriPhillippe has enjoyed increasing profits ever since.</p>\n<p>He married Elisabet, a local girl, two years after arriving, being attracted by her good looks and innocent nature. However, since learning of the affair with Stefan Maranaeur he has been very bitter towards her, and now treats her as a servant rather than a wife. He also blames Elisabet for not bearing any children; a fact noticedby the rest of the village, who believe this to be the reason for the marriage’s failure.</p>\n<p>Henri-Phillippe is very much the typical Bretonnian, given to exuberance and “theatrical” displays of emotion. He has a lot to lose if the harvest does not go ahead on time and will welcome the PCs as potential rescuers. He will therefore offer 750 gc if the party deals with the skulls before the harvest begins. For each harvest day lost the money on offer will fall by 100 gc. He believes that the skulls have indeed come from some disturbed battlefield; perhaps all that’s needed is to seal up some tomb entrance to stop the skulls getting out. During their period of hire PCs may sleep in the fermenting shed and will receive free food and drink.</p>\n<p>If you are using this scenario as part of a campaign you may wish to have Rocheteau offering a percentage profit from the harvest as payment. A good harvest will net Henri-Phillippe 5,000 gc in one year’s time, rising by 1000 gc for each extra year the wine is matured, (full maturity being reached in five years). Rocheteau will open negotiation at 15% but may be bargained to 20%. The party must state how many years they wish to wait and individuals must return at the appropriate harvest-time to collect their share of the agreed sum. For each harvest day lost, Rocheteau’s profit falls by 10%.</p>\n<h3>The Cellar</h3>\n<p>Rocheteau’s house is not mapped, but searching the cellar will reveal fairly recent brickwork behind one of the large wine barrels (there is only 1’ of space between wall and barrel).</p>\n<p>If asked about this, Rocheteau (who may be wondering what</p>\n<p>people were doing rooting in the cellar since the only entrance is via the kitchen) will state that the alcove was sealed to combat damp. Dwarfs or those who make a successful Trade (Mining)</p>\n<p>Skill Test will notice that the brickwork is less than 5 years old and that there is no sign of damp anywhere in the cellar (which, Rocheteau will note, is proof that it was a sound idea).</p>\n<p>Getting into the sealed alcove is difficult. Lack of space prevents the use of a sledgehammer. If the wall is to be knocked down then the large (heavy) wine barrel must first be moved or smashed. If access to the alcove is gained, a desiccated body can be seen, one hand chained to the wall. A wine barrel and ladle are next to the body. If the body is searched a letter can be found. Part of the letter has been eaten by mould; the remaining text is as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My Dearest Stefan</p>\n<p>How much I have missed you. How much longer can we keep up the pretence? One day we will surely be uncovered. I hardly dare see you when you visit for fear that the look in my eyes will reveal the love in my heart. Can you not see the way I tremble when our hands meet in greeting, do my eyes not follow you when-</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The letter, naturally enough, is from Elisabet Rocheteau.</p>\n<h3>Reaction to Events</h3>\n<p>If, during the course of the adventure, Henri-Phillippe comes face to-face with Dieter Maranaeur, he will turn pale, as if seeing a ghost. He had no idea that his victim had a twin and will assume Stefan somehow managed to escape. The GM may wish to have Henri-Philippe break down and confess at this point, perhaps running into the cellar in temporary madness to check on the “cell.” Alternatively, Henri-Philippe might be overcome with anger that his enemy still lives and attack Dieter immediately, saying something like, “You! I don’t know how you did it but you’re not going to escape death a second time.”</p>\n<p>However, if confronted with the evidence of his crime (i.e., a body in the cellar) Rocheteau will attempt to bluff, bribe, or fight his way out.</p>","folder":"yB7s0OOrS3UGCVZv","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

For one reason or another (but mainly because each succeeding generation was developing more and more mutations), none of the family had left their barony for more than seventy years.</p>\n<p>Gotthard was bored in the family's crumbling castle, tired of the same old faces (and beaks, and tentacles): his sister spent all her time hunched over dismembered corpses; his brother was obsessed with taxidermy; his mother was completely deranged; and his father looked more like a giant cockroach every day. Eventually, he could bear it no longer.</p>\n<p>Although, rather surprisingly, they had yet to receive a call from the Witch Hunters, the von Wittgensteins had developed a rather unsavoury reputation among the riverfolk who passed beneath their towering castle. Mutants seemed more numerous in those waters, to say nothing of corpses. He had developed a correspondence with a friend in Middenheim, who hinted at dark pleasures that he knew he would have to experience for himself.</p>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard von Wittgenstein} arrived in the city a few months ago, and through the influence of high-ranking cult members and his own boundless energy and ambition, he rose quickly. Under the assumed name of Gotthard Wallenstein, he became not only the Chairman of the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild} but also the Convenor of the @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, giving him considerable power over the city’s economy. So far, he has only used this power to line his own pockets and those of his friends, but he has something special planned for the last night of the Carnival.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/festival-of-fine-ales.webp\" width=\"297\" height=\"397\" /></div>\n<h3>Gotthard’s Plan</h3>\n<p>As readers will gather from <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, Carnival week is a raucous time, when the normally dour Middenheimers let loose and enjoy themselves. People come from all over the Empire to join in the festivities: it is a time of spectacular parties, and monumental hangovers. This year, the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild} has announced that on the last night of the Carnival, it will pay for every fountain in the city to flow with wine instead of water. Although Gotthard believes the idea was his alone, it was in fact subtly suggested to him by the Law Lord (and Purple Hand leader) @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}, who thought it a good way to blunt public outrage at the new taxes he is forcing through, while simultaneously focusing attention on the merchants rather than the Law Lords. Such a display of conspicuous wealth, coupled with a few well-placed rumours, will promote the idea that the merchants are somehow behind the new measures, or at least that they are profiting handsomely from them.</p>\n<p>Unknown to Wasmeier, @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard}— who is completely ignorant of Wasmeier’s plot or his status as a member of the Purple Hand — has added a further detail to the plan. He has obtained a huge quantity of a drug known as @Item[VWTPVAGlcFf48qCX]{Estalian Mosca}, a powerful stimulant rumoured to fuel many wild parties, and plans to spike the free wine with it. For the last night of the Carnival and most of the following day, Middenheim will become one vast revelry, a tribute that will surely attract the notice of Slaanesh and may even lead to the city’s fall.</p>\n<h4>Preparations</h4>\n<p>Through cult contacts in Marienburg, @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard} has obtained three barrels of @Item[VWTPVAGlcFf48qCX]{Mosca}: a huge quantity, representing tens of thousands of individual doses. Brought into the city under the cover of the hundreds of barrels supplying the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales} at the @JournalEntry[UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{Great Park}, Gotthard inspects the barrels when he visits on Wellentag around 1 p.m. Having marked the barrels in question, he goes about his business while one of his trusted agents, a dissolute lass named Addic, will ‘buy’ the ‘ales’ in question and have them delivered to a restaurant and tavern in the @JournalEntry[ibTyizgEbQHzSzTf]{Neumarkt}-@JournalEntry[UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor} district called the @JournalEntry[yzJ1UAQ911qMCndY]{Templar’s Downfall}, ostensibly to add to their stock. From there, the schemers decant the drug into empty wine bottles, which are ‘delivered’ in cases of twelve bottles to various warehouses around the city, where the wine purchased by the Guild is stored. It takes several days for the cult to spike all of the wine, but everything should be complete in time for the promised filling of the fountains on Festag evening.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wine-barrels.webp\" width=\"542\" height=\"343\" /></div>\n<h3>The Best-Laid Plans</h3>\n<p>As simple as this plan is, there are a number of things that can go wrong, tipping off the Characters that something sinister is afoot and prompting them to investigate. Here is one example.</p>\n<h4>A Simple Mistake</h4>\n<p>If they are at the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales} between noon and 1 p.m., the Characters come upon a commotion at a beer tent with a sign outside reading <em>‘J. Thijksson, Marienburg’</em>. If the Characters investigate, they see several employees and bystanders struggling to hold steady a clearly intoxicated Carnival-goer spewing an increasingly incomprehensible stream of colourful lanauge. The drunkard is raving in the language filthy enough to make a state soldier blush, and when brought outside the tent turns his vitriol first towards a series of horrified patrons who seem to know him, then to a nearby tent pole, a rain barrel — anything within earshot.</p>\n<p>A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test (+10 for Physicians, Spies, or anyone else who has practical knowledge of drugs and poisons) reveals a strange, glazed look in the drunkard’s eyes, a flush in his face, and profuse sweat running down his forehead and cheeks, quite out of keeping with the weather. Others may make an <strong>Easy (+40) Intelligence</strong> Test to observe that it is very early in the day for anyone, even a seasoned drinker, to be as drunk as this man seems to be. At that exact moment, his eyes start almost out of his head, his whole body is wracked by a tremendous spasm, and he falls down dead with blood leaking out of his eyes, ears, and mouth.</p>\n<p>Questioning the staff and bystanders turns up that the man came into the tent with his fiancée and a number of friends and relations from both families. He ordered a beer, took one sip, and spat it out with an oath, saying that it was not beer at all. The embarrassed tent staff took the barrel off and were in the process of tapping another one when the drinker apparently went insane.</p>\n<p>If the Characters try to locate the barrel, they are pointed to one at the side of the tent that turns out to be empty, and seems perfectly normal. An observant bystander may be able to tell them that the drinker was served from a barrel marked only with a plain looking label, but the empty barrel bears a familiar brewers seal, as do all the others that the Characters can see.</p>\n<p>The unfortunate drinker was accidentally served a full tankard of @Item[VWTPVAGlcFf48qCX]{Mosca} by a staff member who is not in on the plot, and one swig was enough to cause a fatal overdose. One of the tent’s staff, an intermediary for the @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{Jade Sceptre}, hurried it out of sight in the curtained stock area at the back of the tent before the Characters arrived, which is where it should have been all along. The three barrels of Mosca are hidden among almost a hundred others, stacked at the back of the tent to serve the day’s drinkers, and the Characters are not permitted to interfere with the stock: the staff call the Watch if they persist in investigating the inventory.</p>\n<p>No matter how they try, the Characters are unable to find anything wrong with the beer sold in the tent. If they try to claim that the tent’s beer is poisoned, they are thrown out; any complaints to the Watch are met with polite skepticism and a promise to investigate ‘in due course’. This, naturally, never happens.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are still at the tent at 1 p.m., they see Gotthard arrive, although they may not know who he is. He seems to be just another well-to-do festival-goer until, mug in hand, he motions one of the staff to one side. A <strong>Hard (–20) Lore (Chaos)</strong> Test or a <strong>Difficult (–10) Lore (Slaanesh)</strong> Test leads a Character to recognise a Jade Sceptre hand sign in the exchange of gestures. After a whispered exchange, he goes through into the stock area, emerging about thirty seconds later, finishing his drink, and carrying on with a circuit of the festival. Along the way, the Characters may be able to see him nod to a disreputable-looking woman — Addic — in passing.</p>\n<p>If they watch the tent, Addic arrives an hour or so later with a donkey-cart and three hired guards, loading up the three barrels and driving to the @JournalEntry[yzJ1UAQ911qMCndY]{Templar’s Downfall}. The Characters have a chance to intercept the cart at this point, although the Watch will not look favourably on anything that seems like attempted robbery, especially if the guards — a sensible precaution for anyone moving drink across the city during Carnival week — are injured.</p>\n<p>Once in the Templar’s Downfall, the barrels are safe from anything less than a full-scale assault. Secure in the cellar, the drug is decanted. If they are still watching the place at noon the following day, the Characters see several crates of bottled wine being loaded on to a cart for delivery to the Merchants’ Guild, but they will not see any barrels leaving and they will not know that anything is wrong with the ‘wine’.</p>\n<p>If the Characters manage to sneak or force their way into the cellar of the @JournalEntry[yzJ1UAQ911qMCndY]{Templar’s Downfall} before the process is complete, they find it crowded with @JournalEntry[TzLOTKnYCmflK3aO]{Jade Sceptre cultists} who attack any intruders on sight. They outnumber the Characters by at least three to one, and are desperate to ensure that no word of their activities gets out. If the Characters manage to get into the cellar after noon on Aubentag, they find the three marked barrels, all empty. It takes a <strong>Hard (–20) Extended Trade (Apothecary) </strong>or <strong>Trade (Poisoner) </strong>Test with 8 required SLs to identify the rapidly drying residue inside the barrels as @Item[VWTPVAGlcFf48qCX]{Estalian Mosca}, with each roll requiring about five minutes of examination.</p>\n<h4>What Now?</h4>\n<p>Even if the Characters have realised what is going on, and have followed the trail from the @JournalEntry[yzJ1UAQ911qMCndY]{Templar’s Downfall} to the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}, they will not simply be able to storm in and expose the plot. The Guild, and @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard} as its Chairman and Convenor of the @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission on Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, have too much clout for a wild accusation from a group of adventurers from out of town to be taken seriously.</p>\n<p>If they decide to take action themselves, they will have to track down all the tainted wine before it reaches fountains all across the city, and either take it or destroy it. Neither course is likely to endear them to the thousands of people who are looking forward to free wine, and the results could range from a mob beating to a full-blown riot.</p>\n<h4>Oh, What A Night</h4>\n<p>The rest of this adventure is left to the GM, based on the Characters’ actions so far, the contacts they have made within the city, and how they decide to deal with the problem. At the GM’s option, the city may indeed see a night of unbridled havoc if they fail, perhaps accompanied by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.8gG2Wim6wAlJWRax]{Daemonettes} appearing here and there.</p>\n<h4>The Daemon Drink</h4>\n<p>Alternatively, some other power may step in and save the day. For example, a faction of hard-line temperance campaigners (possibly led by one or more flagellants) might lay siege to the @JournalEntry[yzJ1UAQ911qMCndY]{Templar’s Downfall}, denouncing it as a den of iniquity and making it impossible to move the tainted barrels to the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}. They might gather outside the guild house, making it impossible to take the wine to the fountains, or they might attack the fountains themselves.</p>\n<p>Sigmarite flagellants, of course, might cause a riot simply by their presence in the city, so perhaps the protests are led by a priest of Ulric — possibly a @JournalEntry[GkT1arSV9rYhYvrG]{Wolf-Kin} — who was granted a vision warning of a threat to the city from the wine. </p>\n<p>In any event, the protest devolves into a series of riots as townsfolk and visitors exchange harsh words, improvised missiles, and blows with the protestors. The situation continues to spiral out of control until the Watch has to intervene in force, which might prevent them from being somewhere else at a crucial time.</p>\n<p>For an added layer of complication, the protestors might include some followers of Khorne from a local cult (such as the @JournalEntry[Xd2AagAWwGfO3N3s]{Crimson Skull} — for the Blood God and the Prince of Pleasure are implacable enemies). The two cults will fight it out under cover of the riots.</p>\n<h4>In Vino Verminous</h4>\n<p>To add to the confusion even further, the Skaven might steal the tainted wine to help in their attack on the city at the end of which will occur during <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. Bottles or cases of the wine are planted in the kitchens of the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, the @JournalEntry[2Ey13dReriX0OnZY]{Wizards’ and Alchemists’ Guilds}, and other selected locations, to lower their defences and make it easier for the assorted and sometimes conflicting Skaven plans to come to fruition.</p>\n<h3>Ending the Adventure</h3>\n<p>The adventure ends when the plot has been thwarted, or when the fountains begin to flow with the tainted wine. The Characters may have learned more about the cult of the @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{Jade Sceptre} and @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard von Wittgenstein}, and they may know that he is the last of the von Wittgensteins, living under an assumed name. They may have earned themselves some leverage with a major figure in the city, just in time to make use of it in the plot of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. Although Gotthard’s influence is limited, every little helps!</p>\n<p>If things have not gone well, the Characters will not only have failed to stop the attack on the city, but wasted precious time. They will have some catching up to do if they want to thwart the greater plot of Karl-Heinz Wasmeier and the Purple Hand.</p>\n<p>For total success in this adventure — the plot foiled and Gotthard exposed or turned into a tool for the Characters to use — each Character should be awarded @Exp[100,Foiled or exposed Gotthard's Plan]{100 Experience Points}, with the usual bonuses for bright ideas and good roleplaying. For partial success or failure, reduce the awards in proportion to the party’s achievements.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wine-barrels.webp","folder":"ufP7LQgh8ojHBCOk","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Cameo Adventures","sort":200000}}}

If you Charge, your Action must be a Melee Test to attack an opponent. If your opponent is at least your Move characteristic in yards away before you Charge, but within your Run range (see the Run entry in the Movement Table for how far you can move when Charging), you will also gain +1 Advantage as you barrel into your opponent.</p>\n<h4>Disengaging</h4>\n<p>If you are @JournalEntry[fysKUlMiHSkbFnWy]{Engaged} in combat, and no longer wish to be trading blows with your opponent, you have the following two options for leaving combat safely.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Advantage</strong>: If you have more Advantage than your opponents, you are in a superior position and can easily </p>\n<p>manoeuvre yourself beyond reach. If you choose to drop your Advantage to 0, you can move away from your opponents without penalty, perhaps choosing to Charge a new target, run away as fast as possible, or backstep a little and fire a pistol in an opponent’s face!</p>\n<p><strong>Use Dodge</strong>: If you have lower or equal Advantage to your opponents or do not wish to spend your Advantage, you are pinned in place. If you wish to escape, you will need to use your Action to make an <strong>Opposed Dodge/Melee</strong> Test. If you succeed, you gain +1 Advantage, and can use your Move to go anywhere you wish using the normal rules. If you fail, each opponent defeating you gains +1 Advantage and makes it impossible for you to escape without a blow to your back.</p>\n<h4>Fleeing</h4>\n<p>If you cannot escape otherwise, you can turn your back and flee as your Move. Often, Fleeing is involuntary, caused by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.kJNAY1YRaCy9IgmT]{Terror} or magic.</p>\n<p>If you flee, your opponent immediately gains 1 Advantage and may attempt 1 free attack. The free attack is an unopposed Melee Test using whatever weapon is currently held, using the SL scored to Damage you as normal. As you are throwing caution to the wind, your opponent gains +20 to hit you. If you are hit, your opponent gains +1 Advantage, and you must enact a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test: if failed, gain a Broken Condition, and a further +1 @Condition[Broken] condition per SL below 0.  Once the free attack is concluded, you may move up to your Run Movement (see the Movement Table) directly away from your opponent, assuming you still can.</p>\n<h4>Running</h4>\n<p>On your turn, you can use your Action to sprint. This requires an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test, and the distance covered is in addition to your Move this round. You sprint your Run movement + SL in yards (see the Movement Table for your Run movement). So, a character with Move 4 who rolled –2 SL would sprint an additional 14 yards (16–2=14).</p>\n<h4>Climbing</h4>\n<p>Most climb moves won’t need Tests. Climbing rules are only required when the Climb is difficult or if knowing exactly how long you take to ascend is important.</p>\n<p>Climbing a ladder or similarly easy-to-climb surface does not require a Test but does slow you down. You move at half rate up or down ladders or other easily climbed surfaces. So, it would cost 4 yards of your Movement to climb a 2-yard ladder. If you want to climb more quickly, spend your Action to make an <strong>Average (+20) Climb</strong> Test. You will Climb an extra Movement + SL yards. So, a character with Movement 4 who rolled +2 SL will climb an additional 6 yards (4+2=6).</p>\n<p>If both hands are free, you can climb a surface with suitable handholds with a Climb Test using your Action for the turn. You ascend or descend at a rate of ½ Movement + SL in yards.</p>\n<p>Climbing difficulty is set by the GM and varies with the nature of the climbed surface. Some climbs will be beyond the ability of most characters without the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.MGEPI4jNhymNIRVz]{Scale Sheer Surface} Talent.</p>","folder":"xeg3gSX34lWS8L4B","sort":1,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Moving"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Moving","sort":1}}}

The upright and incorruptible Joachim Hoflich was secretly murdered, and replaced by a Doppelgänger, a shapeshifting creature that Wasmeier coached to imitate him. To control the erudite and thoughtful Reiner Ehrlich, Wasmeier kidnapped Reya, his beloved niece, and made it clear her safety was dependent on Ehrlich’s cooperation.</p>\n<p>The Law Lords always present a united front when advising the Graf, so Wasmeier was able to oppose the new taxes in public — conveniently directing suspicion away from himself — while manipulating his two colleagues into overruling him.</p>\n<h3>The Chancellor</h3>\n<p>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} did not need such drastic action: he is always in favour of any measure that raises more money. However, Wasmeier was glad to learn of the Chancellor’s weakness for certain alchemical powders, and is using this knowledge to keep Sparsam's support for the taxes from wavering in the face of a public backlash.</p>\n<h3>The High Priest</h3>\n<p>As the head of the cult of Ulric, the high priest @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} has considerable influence over the Graf. Wasmeier worried about this, as well as Ar-Ulric’s opposition to the taxes, especially the @JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{Temple Tax} — until his agents uncovered a secret that would place the powerful priest in the palm of Wasmeier’s hand. For some time, Ar-Ulric had been carrying on a secret affair, in violation of his vow of celibacy. Best of all, the affair was with @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}, the Graf ’s paramour.</p>\n<p>Armed with stolen love-letters that could destroy Ar-Ulric’s career and might even see him executed for treason, Wasmeier knew he could control the priest — and that the Graf ’s paramour would also exert her influence on his behalf, rather than see the affair exposed.</p>\n<h3>The Graf’s Champion</h3>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} is a popular figure around Middenheim. Whilst his duty to defend Boris Todbringer in judicial combat is largely a ceremonial one, he is still regarded as the doughty and honourable champion of the city as well as of the Graf. An ambush was laid in one of Dieter’s favourite watering-holes, and he was kidnapped and hypnotised. He has no memory of the event, but now he finds himself speaking out in favour of the new taxes whenever they are mentioned.</p>\n<h3>Other Major Npcs</h3>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} judges — quite correctly — that these steps have given him enough influence over the Graf to ensure that the taxes will be passed. The other major NPCs have not yet formed any opinion on the matter, although Wasmeier is watching them closely.</p>\n<h3>The End-Game</h3>\n<p>At the time of the adventure, @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} effectively controls the @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf}, and through him the city. However, his control is fragile: if any one of his victims should turn on him, all would be lost. Therefore, he plans a daring and brilliant coup to cement his control.</p>\n<p>The first month’s taxes are due at the end of Carnival week. At this time Wasmeier expects resistance from Dwarfs, wizards and priests will be at its strongest: there may be an exodus from the city, or an outright refusal to pay.</p>\n<p>On the last night of the Carnival, the Doppelgänger is to replace the Graf. To everyone’s relief, this ‘Graf ’ rises from his prolonged grief, furious at the way things have spiralled out of control. Learning that @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Hoflich} and @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich} were in favour of the new taxes, he summons them to his office. The Graf ’s messengers find Hoflich’s rotting body in his apartment under his desk. </p>\n<p>On the desk they discover a note bearing an address where @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric’s} love-letters can be found. After this discovery, the following events will occur swiftly at the Doppelgänger’s commander: news of Ar-Ulric’s and @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle’s} affair is leaked, leading to public scandal; Ehrlich is dismissed, but kindly, given the pressure that was brought to bear on him, and Wasmeier is the only Law Lord standing. Reya will be handed over to the Ordo Novitiae of the Nuln cell of Purple Hand, who will induct her into the worship of Tzeentch.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterward, the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} dies in an ‘accident’ involving a particularly strong dose of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald's Delight}. Evidence that he was the ‘hidden hand’ behind the whole plot is found among his papers. The ‘Graf ’ appoints @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} as Chancellor, and he begins appointing allies and puppets to all the vacant posts, including the three Law Lords. Middenheim’s defences, already weakened by the taxes, are  allowed to run down, and when the attack finally comes, the Purple Hand seizes control of the city, turning it into a bastion for the advancing forces of Chaos.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE END IS EXTREMELY NIGH</em></h3>\n<p><em>It is possible, though not desirable, for the events of The Enemy Within to continue should Wasmeier's plan come to fruition as detailed above. The Horned Rat, part four of the campaign, will remain quite playable as is, but Empire in ruins, part five, will require some ingenuity on the part of the GM. While the Characters can claim no true victory without the possibility of failure, be aware that Middenheim's fall to the powers of Chaos will present a challenge not just for the Empire, but for the GM as well.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"WdnGu3bWeo44Lk4e","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 3: The Evil Plot","sort":-100000}}}

However, in the sun-drenched south, Myrmidia is much more than this: she acts as the patron deity of both the Estalian Kingdoms and the Tilean City States, and is fanatically worshipped in both realms. Because of this, her cult is the largest in the Old World, for all it has a limited presence in the Empire. She is commonly portrayed as a tall, muscular, young woman armed and equipped in archaic, southern stylings. She is known for her calm, honourable approach to all matters, and her clerics do what they can to emulate this.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Myrmidia grants generals the insight to win battles with minimal losses, and soldiers the skill-at-arms to defeat enemies quickly and without significant losses. Because of this, her cult is steadily growing among the armies and garrisons of the Empire, especially in the Reikland, Averland, and Wissenland. In the Empire, the cult has three orders of significance. The Order of the Eagle tends to the temples and their surrounding communities, and is led from Nuln by the ‘Eagle of the North’, the most powerful Myrmidian north of the Vaults. The templar Order of the Righteous Spear has a chapterhouse attached to each of these temples, each commanded by the local high priest. A second templar order, the Order of the Blazing Sun, is the oldest Myrmidian order in the Empire, and works independently of the Order of the Eagle.</p>\n<p>Myrmidia’s clerics in the Empire normally wear blue cowls over white robes with red edging, with her symbol either sewn onto the left breast or worn as a cloak-clasp.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Most of Myrmidia’s holy sites are found in Estalia and Tilea, and are associated with the goddess’s campaigns across those realms when she manifested as a mortal over two-thousand years ago. In the Empire, the goddess has much less of a presence, with temples only in major towns and cities, and only a single monastic order cloistered in the Monastery of the Black Maiden in Wissenland. Temples to Myrmidia tend to follow the architectural styles of Tilea and Estalia, with domed roofs covering square or&nbsp;rectangular halls. Their exteriors are often carved with low reliefs showing battle scenes or tableaux of weapons and shields. Shrines may take the form of miniature temples, statues of the goddess, or free-standing sculptures of stacked weapons, shields, and armour. Myrmidia’s holy sites are also known for their scandalous depictions of the goddess and her saints, who are often presented wearing little more than scarves about their waists, which many Sigmarites find completely unacceptable.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances from Myrmidia are usually military in nature. A cultist may be ordered to defeat an enemy champion in single combat, or to train a group of peasants and lead them in the defence of their village. Protecting pilgrimage routes to sites of importance to Myrmidia are also not uncommon.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>Strictures</strong></em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Act with honour and dignity in all matters.</em></li>\n<li><em>Respect prisoners of war, and never kill an enemy who surrenders</em></li>\n<li><em>Show no mercy to the unrepentant enemies of Humanity.</em></li>\n<li><em>Obey all honourable orders.</em></li>\n<li><em>Preserve the weak from the horrors of war.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iIfYOlNrLb0uiV8c]{Blessing of Fortune}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.2WN0muIB2BFd4kBO]{Blessing of Righteousness}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Q91bWCEn0gt33fGT]{Blazing Sun}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.7KUKKbXBv8MbyEHt]{Eagle's Eye}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.nyZNUwJ54MTLKQ7Y]{Fury's Call}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ezVl3vFWTwHfNXL3]{Inspiring}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.V8GCeqgk1FNGFg76]{Shield of Myrmidia}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.BVZWihaal1zq3aJs]{Spear of Myrmidia}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/myrmidia.webp","folder":"NkiXlTQtgNkW3FMs","sort":500001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Religion and Belief"}}}

Like Boecks he was a master of the Cobblers&rsquo; Guild, and like Boecks he was found with gruesome stitching. Another similarity with the first murder was that there seemed to be no way the murderers could have got in or out of the crime scene.</p>\n<p>The patterns made alarm bells ring among Ubersreik&rsquo;s trade guilds and the Town Council quickly appointed an investigator to look into things.</p>\n<p>Schlingbach lived in a four-storey house in one of the nicest parts of the Artisans&rsquo; Quarter with his family. He used the ground floor as a shop, the first as his workshop while the top two floors are his family&rsquo;s living space. He was a pleasant and well-liked family man and no one could think of a reason why he might have been killed.</p>\n<p>Br&ouml;gue and the puppets used a similar plan to get rid of Schlingbach, except discovering that he lived with his family now, they chose to strike early in the evening, in the hope of not disturbing anyone else. The three puppets flew onto the roof and climbed down the chimney just as darkness was falling. Then they hid in his workshop, as he continued work. After the rest of his family moved upstairs for the night, they seized their opportunity.</p>\n<p>They first tormented him by casting Treason of Tzeentch on him. Then they surrounded him and barracked him about his behaviour towards Br&ouml;gue. At this point, they were interrupted by Una, Schlingbach&rsquo;s toddler daughter. Nervously, he told her to go back upstairs, which she did, but she got a good look at the three Daemons.</p>\n<p>Eventually, when the puppets felt they had taunted and tormented him enough, leaving him the same tiny wounds that they had inflicted on Boecks. They then suffocated him by stitching up his mouth and made their way back up the chimney.</p>\n<p>Anya, Schlingbach&rsquo;s wife, discovered him some minutes later.</p>\n<p>Zahndahl seems bemused even as she recounts this. It is impossible that anyone came in or out through the shop during that time as Anya would have heard, and there were traders out on the street, in any case, who swore no one did.</p>\n<p>Friede Schlypper did have a look at the stitching around his mouth but found it too gory to pass judgement on the quality of the workmanship.</p>\n<p>Zahndahl is happy to show the Characters the crime scene, but she says there is nothing to be gleaned from it. In fact, on a&nbsp;<strong>Hard (&ndash;20) Perception</strong>&nbsp;Test a Character can detect a thin thread of finest cobbler&rsquo;s yarn leading up from the fireplace to the top of the chimney. This thread is clearly not strong enough to carry the weight of even the smallest child. The thread is magical and comes from one of the Daemons&rsquo; balls of ever-lasting yarn. No tracks can be found near the hearth, however, as there have been fires lit in the fireplace since the murder.</p>\n<p>If the Characters question the family, they might be able to learn that Una has said a few times to her mother that<em>&nbsp;&lsquo;the dolls did it&rsquo;</em>, as she saw the puppets with her father shortly before he died. Anya dismissed this as just her imagination, of course.</p>\n<p>If taken seriously, Una can describe the dolls as stick-like and brightly painted, and that her father had been talking to them just as if they were real people.</p>\n<p>Dieter&rsquo;s body is still being prepared by the Mourners at Morr&rsquo;s Field. Characters with the right sort of influence might be able to gain access to it, if they insist. Zahndahl is reluctant to use her official position and influence there as she feels the cults are outside the jurisdiction of the Town Council, but could be persuaded to.</p>\n<p>If they get a look at the body, the Characters notice that it has a good many small scratches and bruises all over it, especially the arms and upper torso. The Daemons&rsquo; stick-like limbs and spiky features cause wounds that make it look like their victims have been dragged through a rugged bush. This is similarly true of the other bodies, though Boecks&rsquo;s body is harder to inspect.</p>\n<p>However, suffocation is the actual cause of death. Schlingbach died after having his mouth and nose stitched together expertly while he still lived. The stitching was done by the same three hands that did the previous murder as any master cobbler who inspected both would be able to tell. However, there is only one left in town and he is not prepared to come and check the body out.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 36.1449%;\">Stitched up mouth</td>\n<td style=\"width: 63.0738%;\">Br&ouml;gue&rsquo;s motive, suspects him of gossiping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 36.1449%;\">Pattern became apparent</td>\n<td style=\"width: 63.0738%;\">Zahndahl will mention</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 36.1449%;\">Scratches, pin pricks, bite marks, and bruises</td>\n<td style=\"width: 63.0738%;\">Zahndahl can mention / Can inspect the corpse</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 36.1449%;\">No way in or out</td>\n<td style=\"width: 63.0738%;\">Zahndahl will mention</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 36.1449%;\">Thread in fireplace</td>\n<td style=\"width: 63.0738%;\">Scene of crime</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 36.1449%;\">Magical Winds of Tzeentch</td>\n<td style=\"width: 63.0738%;\">Still permeates the crime scene</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 36.1449%;\">&lsquo;The dolls did it&rsquo;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 63.0738%;\">Una Schlingbach</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

She is shouting to the bear to stay still, but without effect.</p>\n<p>The bear has a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.KtYgLHcSLpHmnGI2]{standard profile} but its Movement score is reduced to 3 due to dragging the piper. Characters with a higher Initiative score than the bear must still make a successful Initiative Test in order to act before it can attack the cornered urchin. You should also make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Initiative</strong> Test for the piper at the beginning of each Round, based on a score of 31. On the first successful Test, she regains her feet and starts using her Animal Training Skill (45) to calm the bear, provided it is not in combat. If any Character attacks the bear, it cannot be calmed down unless it is first successfully distracted (see below). </p>\n<p>The Characters have a number of options apart from simply standing by and watching the terrified urchin be shredded.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/bestiary/bear.webp\" width=\"248\" height=\"232\" /></div>\n<h3>Attacking</h3>\n<p>The Characters can attack the bear and try to kill it — this is probably the least satisfactory option. Although it saves the urchin and perhaps many others, the piper is not happy about losing her livelihood!</p>\n<h3>Distraction</h3>\n<p>Secondly, they can try to distract the bear long enough for the urchin to escape. If the Characters try this, make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Willpower</strong> Test for the bear. If it fails, it is distracted long enough to allow the urchin to escape. However, it is still angry, and attacks the nearest Character unless it can be calmed with a <strong>Charm Animal</strong> Test opposed by the bear’s <strong>Willpower</strong>. A single SL on the Opposed Test is enough to calm the bear long enough for the piper to regain her senses and pacify her friend.</p>\n<h3>The Chain</h3>\n<p>The Characters can take hold of the bear’s chain and try to pull it away. Only Characters who make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test can summon the courage to do this, but the Test may be attempted once per Round until successful. Make an Opposed Test using the total Strength scores of the Characters pulling on the chain, and the bear’s Strength of 55, repeating each Round until successful. This draws the bear’s attention, allowing the piper to calm it.</p>\n<h3>Charm</h3>\n<p>A Character can calm the bear down on a successful <strong>Average (+20) Charm Animal</strong> Test. If the Characters fail the Test, the attempt counts as a distraction (see above).</p>\n<h3>Magic</h3>\n<p>A spellcaster might try to save the day with magic. While the bear is too large to be affected by the Petty spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.gQ14yfwjfcJgNpMp]{Animal Friend}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.4ePe5oNQakA8nJlk]{Sleep} might be useful, as might @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.WeIdAA7KArjUZfyH]{Entangle} or the Lore of Beasts spells @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.FaHVRxdljzqklNTC]{Beast Master} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.gwnNz34Rh0jW4WmF]{Beast Tongue}. Resourceful Players will be able to come up with many more ideas.</p>\n<p>The best spells to use are those that can calm, subdue, or entangle the bear quickly. Wounding spells might be effective, but most enrage the bear further, forcing the Characters to kill the bear. The Characters receive no thanks from the piper who has just lost her star attraction. Spells and miracles with an area of effect risk wounding the urchin as well as the bear, and possibly the nearer bystanders.</p>\n<h3>Resolution</h3>\n<p>The entertainer might make for an interesting contact if she is happy with the Characters’ resolution. She has regular dealings with the @JournalEntry[vcw9pxNsMoxkTbRV]{Low Kings’} thugs and dealmakers and has heard whispers of Chaos cults operating within Middenheim. The extent of her knowledge is up to the GM, but she freely shares it for the Characters’ help.</p>\n<p>If the Characters kill the bear, the urchin runs off at the first opportunity, and any attempt to prevent this is met with a kick in the shins. The urchin escapes automatically, and the kicked character must make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Willpower</strong> Test or spend one Round hopping and cursing.</p>\n<p>Each Character who participates in any action that leads to the urchin getting away should receive @Exp[30,Helped the urchin get away]{30 Experience Points}. This award is halved if the bear is killed, and at the GM’s option Taal may decide that the Character is due some Sin points. Characters who manage to subdue the bear without harming it receive @Exp[50, Subdued the Bear with no harm]{50 Experience}.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/animal-training.webp","folder":"KyRXwOjQ3W4XV30X","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Cameo Adventures","sort":406250}}}

{"_id":"fIoZadIapQhCoKOU","name":"Watch The Birdie...","content":"<p>This incident could be used almost anywhere in the city, but is perhaps most effective either in a market area or wherever large numbers of moderately wealthy people are likely to be walking about. The incident takes place in daylight.</p>\n<p>About 30 yards away, there is a sudden blur of action. There is a scream and some shouting, and a bird flies away rapidly, with people throwing stones and other improvised missiles at it. Any Character with an appropriate Skill can identify the bird as a magpie. What do the Characters do?</p>\n<h3>Rushing to Help</h3>\n<p>If the Characters hurry to the scene of the activity, they find a distraught, middle-aged woman from whom the bird has just stolen a jewelled hair-pin, or a furious stallholder from whom it has stolen some small but valuable trinket, or some other victim from whom the bird has stolen something small, shiny, and valuable. By the time they reach the scene, the bird is long gone. If the Characters have failed to make the acquaintance of a major NPC, this could be an opportunity to introduce them — the woman above could be one of the Ladies of the Court, for example.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/magpie-trinket.webp\" width=\"344\" height=\"328\" /></div>\n<h3>Shooting</h3>\n<p>The Characters suffer from the usual –20 penalty for shooting at a Little target. There is time for one round of missile fire from the moment the Characters first see the bird to when it disappears behind a tree or rooftop. The bird is flying fast and fairly low, so the Characters’ shots may endanger bystanders and could cause a panic. In this event, a Watch patrol arrives on the scene in [[/r 2d10]] rounds, and the party may be charged with causing a breach of the peace. If the Characters manage to bring the bird down, they are able to explain the situation to the Watch and may get away with a warning and perhaps a spot fine of a Crown or two. Otherwise, a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test, bribery, or some other means is needed to avoid a heavier penalty: a fine of [[/r 2d10]] GCs and the confiscation of their missile weapons.</p>\n<p>If the bird is brought down and the stolen object recovered, the victim offers to pay any fine the Characters may have incurred, and gives them 5 GCs as a reward.</p>\n<h3>Pursuit</h3>\n<p>If the Characters decide to follow the bird, you may make use of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.03r3y37RFKAFM82c]{pursuit rules}, though unless they can themselves fly they will not catch the creature, merely keep up with it. The bird has an effective Agility of 33 and a Move of 8. Talents such as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.9h82z72XGo9tfgQS]{Excellent Vision} give the usual bonuses. If they manage to keep the bird in sight for 5 successive rounds, they see it fly through a window into the attic of a building several streets away. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) lntelligence</strong> or <strong>Average (+20) Navigation</strong> Test Test is required for the Characters to find the building.</p>\n<p>The building stands a storey taller than those around it, and there is a single door at street level. Going through the door, the Characters find a narrow hallway with doors on either side and a staircase leading upwards. The building is split into apartments, and after two or three landings the Characters reach the door to the attic. The door is locked, but fairly flimsy — a <strong>Challenging (+0) Strength</strong> Test will see it smashed off its hinges.</p>\n<p>Beyond the door is a small attic room furnished with a bed, a table with two chairs, and a small cupboard. A small, wiry, shabbily dressed man of about thirty is sitting on the bed, which is strewn with brightly shining baubles of all descriptions. As the Characters enter the room, a raven takes off in alarm from its perch on the back of a chair and flies out of the window. As soon as he sees that he is outnumbered, the thief surrenders, but he attempts to escape if the opportunity arises.</p>\n<p>If the Characters turn him over to the authorities, they receive a reward of @Credit[17gc10ss]{17 GCs 10/–}, this being 10% of the value of the goods recovered. On the other hand, this thief could be useful if the Characters wish to make contact with the city’s underworld. In either case, a reward of @Exp[25, Discovered the thief]{25 Experience Points} is appropriate for each character who helps the party discover the operation.</p>\n<h3>Further Possibilities</h3>\n<p>The Characters might witness several aerial robberies over a period of time, all in the same general area, until they decide to take action. They could hear rumours of a bird stealing small items of jewellery on a few occasions, or witness a dispute between a stallholder and a shopper who claims that a trinket on the stall was stolen from them a few days ago. The operation can make a good piece of background noise, to distract the players from the main thread of their adventure and to help create the feeling that things are happening in Middenheim even when their Characters aren't around.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/magpie-trinket.webp","folder":"KyRXwOjQ3W4XV30X","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Cameo Adventures","sort":400000}}}
{"_id":"fKwLfKRB9FnTHK97","name":"Encounters","content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">These encounters can be used to add variety to the journey, and to foreshadow events to come in Middenheim.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Survivors</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This type of encounter becomes more frequent as the Characters travel deeper into the Drakwald, and tapers off as they come closer to Middenheim. Trudging along the roadside or begging the protection of an inn’s walls at night, the survivors of bandit or mutant attacks are ragged, penniless, and often wounded.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mothers carry children, the unhurt support the injured, and the young help the elderly along as best they can. Some claim to be nobles, and promise that their families will reward the Characters for seeing them safely to Middenheim, or Altdorf, or simply to the next coaching inn. Some of these may even be telling the truth. Others simply cluster around a coach or an armed group, clamouring for aid and protection.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Refugees</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The closer the Characters come to Middenheim, the heavier the refugee traffic becomes, including Sigmarites, priests, dwarfs, alchemists, and wizards. There are Sigmarites of all classes, trades, and professions, telling stories of religious persecution.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Priests — not only of Sigmar but of other religions as well — who second the tales of anti-Sigmarite violence, and add that the Graf has approved a ruinous series of Temple Taxes, whose only purpose must surely be to drive out every religion save the worship of Ulric. In the crowd there are wizards and alchemists, who grumble about a ‘Scroll Tax’ on paper that makes Middenheim too expensive to live in. As well as Middenheim Dwarfs, who grumble about ‘ungrateful Manlings,’ but only admit privately to another Dwarf that they have been taxed beyond their means and lack the gold to remain in the City of the White Wolf.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Sons of Ulric</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Closer still to Middenheim, the Characters are stopped at an impromptu road block. It is manned by a group of local toughs, all wearing the symbol of a wolf ’s head somewhere on their clothing. Declaring themselves to be the Sons of Ulric, they search the Characters’ coach and persons, looking for ‘Sigmarite scum.’ Anyone with anything that might be interpreted as</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">indicating devotion to Sigmar — whether or not it actually does — is robbed, soundly beaten, and turned back into the forest.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether or not the Characters actively resist, the ‘Sons of Ulric’ are more than happy to resort to violence: a wrong word or look is quite sufficient. If the Characters need to be rescued from the resulting fight, a patrol of Knights Panther happens to come down the road, and the knights question both parties. They neither support nor condemn the ‘Sons of Ulric,’ but they ensure that there is no further violence, and allow the Characters to go on their way. They do not, however, involve themselves in any disputes about stolen property.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Bandits</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The forest is a lawless place, and the Characters have already heard that attacks on coaches have increased lately. When the coach encounters a fallen tree across the road, any Character with a clear forward view may attempt a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test to see telltale axe-marks: it was felled on purpose, and as the coach comes to a stop it is surrounded by bandits!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The numbers and experience of the bandits can vary according to the strength of the party and their travelling companions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Numbers can vary from four or five to a couple of dozen. While the leaders, at least, have a level or two in the Outlaw career, the rest might be local Peasants of various kinds — or they might be hardened outlaws themselves.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Instead of outlaws, the bandits might be unemployed mercenaries with Soldier and/or other Warrior careers, and banditry may be their way of ‘living off the land’ as they make their way eastward toward Ostland and Talabecland, where the threat of war is looming.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most bandits are content to rob their victims of anything valuable or useful, but anyone who looks as though their family is well-to-do — the two daughters of a prosperous Altdorf wool merchant, for example — may be taken prisoner, and their companions sent back to the family with a ransom demand.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Beastmen</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Human bandits are one of the milder threats lurking in the forest. Beastmen are a more savage foe altogether: they certainly kill everyone they encounter, and they are likely to eat them too.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Beastman force consists mainly of Gors, with a few Ungors.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The leader might be a Bray-Shaman, or a powerful warrior such as a Minotaur or a Bestigor with an especially powerful set of combat-related Traits and mutations.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beastmen might fell a tree or resort to some similar subterfuge to stop a passing vehicle, or they might simply burst from the trees and attack — targeting the horses first so that their victims cannot escape.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">More on coaches and combat can be found in the Enemy in Shadows Companion.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Witch Hunters</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With reports of anti-Sigmarite violence on the rise in Middenland, the witch hunters of various Sigmarite orders are particularly active on the road, questioning refugees and hunting for the Sons of Ulric and other miscreants. As the Characters learn along the way, one group of witch hunters was recently active in Middenheim, where they burned 17 accused cultists.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A mounted band of witch hunters might have set up a roadblock, stopping traffic in both directions and questioning all aboard. This might be uncomfortable for any Characters who do not worship Sigmar, as well as for those who do so quietly, with no outward display of Sigmarite emblems such as hammer pendants. Of course, the very things that may convince Sigmarite witch hunters of a Character’s innocence also ensure that an encounter with the Sons of Ulric is far from pleasant.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Road Wardens</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With so much lawlessness on the road, the Imperial Road Wardens are active too. They are patrolling more frequently and in greater numbers, and the Characters and their companions might be stopped anywhere along the road or questioned at an inn where they have stopped for the night.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Characters may have to convince the Road Wardens that they are innocent travellers engaged on legitimate business — but given the increase in traffic bound to Middenheim’s Carnival, and their cargo addressed to a recipient in the city by a reputable and well-known mercantile house, this should not be terribly difficult.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A more serious problem may arise if the Characters run into a press gang. It is well known that both the Road Wardens and the River Patrol have been recruiting aggressively in recent months, and an inn is the perfect spot for a less-than-honest recruiting ploy known as ‘The Emperor’s Shilling’. While his fellows engage the Characters in conversation — being careful to find out their names and home towns — one Road Warden slips a shilling</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">into each of their ale-mugs. If they drink, they are held to have accepted the shilling — and therefore the Emperor’s offer of employment — under an ancient law. Whether they like it or not, they are now Road Wardens and can be taken into the</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">service by force, if necessary. Some taverns provide tankards with glass bottoms, so that a customer can check for coins before drinking, but understandably the press gangs avoid such establishments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If they find themselves ‘impressed’, as the process is called, the Characters have chances to escape, but the Road Wardens already have their names and home towns, which can be circulated around the service on a list of deserters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fun</p>\n<p> The party meets a strange man named Bruno Hillgen. He is carrying a plethora of books and scrolls. He says he is a low level wizard but his primary field of study is linguistics. He is cataloguing colloquial language throughout the Empire in an effort to root out what he believes to be a subtle plot by Tzeentch to bring about some cataclysmic event by slowly changing the Empire’s speech patterns over generations. He will ask each of the players where they are from and then ask them questions about colloquial phrases in their hometown. Do people use the term “two-headed rooster” to describe an annoyingly early riser. Does their village call mushrooms “dryland fish”? What type of bug does the term “Rhya’s revenge” mean?</p>","folder":"zhKNzx21YVsaN3CA","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

And medium dogs. And large ones, too.<br /><br />Why?<span style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: #fafafa;\"><br style=\"text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"text-size-adjust: auto;\" /></span>Well, the core book provides only a basic support for keeping and developing your own dogs (or any pets). We have a base statline for Dogs on page 315 and Wolves on page 317. We also have the rules for Henchmen on page 309.<br /><br />Why are the Henchmen rules so important? Because they are specifically designed for, amongst other things, handling pets. Let's take a look at what they say?<br /><br />In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pets are 'Henchmen'.</li>\n<li>Henchmen have full Character Sheets and are given to a Player to play alongside their PC.</li>\n<li>A Player's Henchmen earn half the XP of their PC.</li>\n<li>This XP is spent as normal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sounds great. But, can you see the missing element here?</p>\n<p>Yup, the Careers in Chapter 3 aren't exactly designed for dogs, or, indeed, any pets, so spending XP could prove a touch difficult.</p>\n<p>So, I'm going to fix that.</p>\n<p>However, before I do, there are more dog stats for us to look at. I added statlines for two breeds of dogs in&nbsp;Enemy in Shadows. These are the Telland Pit Bull on page 98, and the Ulzhammer Shepherd Dog on page 111. I also statted a 'Fighting Dog' to the&nbsp;<em>Guide to Ubersreik</em>, page 53, and there is the Dog used for pulling carts in the&nbsp;<em>Enemy in Shadows Companion</em>&nbsp;on page 22. No need to look 'em up if you don't have the books to hand; it's just good to note they exist for the moment, so you know everything I create below takes these into account.<br /><br />So, looking at those, we have a Dog, a Draught Dog, a Wolf, a Pit Bull, Shepherd Dog, and a Fighting Dog all nicely statted and ready for careers. However, we don't have a single Small but Vicious Dog.<br /><br />Call in the PCs, because this is a Warhammer crime that needs to be investigated!</p>\n<p>It's time to do some doggo statting.</p>\n<p>But, me being me, I'm not just going to do our Small But Vicious, I'm going to loosely cover all dogs. Coz it's my blog and I can.<br /><br />To do that, I'm going to stat 8 different loose domesticated dog types that'll cover all the basics I'll need. The ones I'll go for are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Herd Dogs</li>\n<li>Hound Dogs</li>\n<li>Hunting Dogs</li>\n<li>Lap Dogs</li>\n<li>Mongrel Dogs</li>\n<li>Pit Dogs</li>\n<li>Terrier Dogs</li>\n<li>War Dogs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />#AllTheDogs<br /><br />Well, almost, I'm missing out some work doggos&nbsp;&ndash; you know, ones that pull sleds or the like, the aforementioned 'draught' dog from the&nbsp;<em>Enemy in Shadows Companion</em>&nbsp;&ndash; but I'll add these later.

{"_id":"ggeBjJcnBuIzFcGw","name":"A Purple Hand Welcome","content":"<p>Having made their way into the city successfully, the Characters will no doubt be eager to find Hoffen Strasse, deliver their crate to Captain Scharlach at the sign of the Crossed Keys, and receive the rest of their payment. Once they’ve completed that task, they can find a place to stay, get the lay of the land, and follow up on the various leads that have brought them here: the Purple Hand; Gotthard von Wittgenstein; and Skaven and the missing Wittgenstein warpstone.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have been intelligent and perceptive — and flexible enough in their ethics to ignore orders and open the crate and/or its accompanying letter — they may well suspect that they are being led into a trap. They will approach Hoffen Strasse with caution, but they must still go there: whether they expect to find a paying customer or a cultist ambush, it is the only lead they have.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE PURPLE HAND: A RECAP</em></h3>\n<p><em>Ever since they arrived in Altdorf in <strong>Enemy in Shadows</strong>, the Characters have been watched by agents of the Purple Hand. The cult’s leadership believes that one of the Characters is a high-ranking Purple Hand cultist named Kastor Lieberung, who recently came into a rich inheritance. Despite several attempts at contact, however, ‘Lieberung’ has shown no inclination to hand his wealth over to the cult’s leaders as ordered. In fact, there was no inheritance at all — it was a lie, used by a bounty hunter to bait a trap for the cultist — but the Purple Hand’s leaders do not know this, and the Characters themselves found out the hard way, during their visit to Bögenhafen.</em></p>\n<p><em>Ever since then, Purple Hand agents in every town and city the Characters visited have been trying to make contact and bring ‘Lieberung’ back to the cult’s leadership in Middenheim. Now — thanks, apparently, to the ingenuity of a merchant named @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.FTT9hoFswIqAW9do]{Matthias Blucher} — the errant Magister is in Middenheim, and almost within the cult’s grasp — but it so happens that the cult’s leaders are preoccupied with an even grander plan.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Hoffen Strasse</h3>\n<p>Hoffen Strasse runs from the commercial Kaufseit district into the menacing @JournalEntry[06LuFlBESLckr28m]{Ostwald} slums (see @JournalEntry[hilEMhOF52SCjG6s]{The City}). The Crossed Keys lies almost exactly on the border between the two districts. It is a four-storey house with a locksmith’s shop on the ground floor, marked by a sign bearing the image of two crossed keys. Like many buildings of this type, the upper floor can be occupied by the shop’s proprietor and their family, or rented out to others.</p>\n<p>As the Characters approach, they can see that both house and shop are boarded up. The shutters are fastened, and planks have been nailed across the doors with symbols of Ulric painted on them: wolf ’s heads, axes, and anti-Sigmarite slogans. The house is clearly empty.</p>\n<p>If the Characters ask locals about the house, one of two things will happen. If they are reasonably discreet and make it sound as if they are merely curious, they will be told about the witch hunters and the previous occupants of the building. If they ask after Captain Scharlach and explain that they have an important delivery for him, they will be met with blank looks: the locksmith was Dieter Schlage, they will be told, and the people who lived upstairs were called Bork. No one has ever heard of a Captain Scharlach. If the Characters persist in asking after him, the Watch may be called and they will have to spend several hours answering awkward questions.</p>\n<h4>The Cruel Truth</h4>\n<p>Two Imperial witch hunters came up from Altdorf, arrested everybody in the house, and had them burned as Chaos-worshippers. As it happens, they were quite correct — with the exception of the unfortunate locksmith (who was unaware of the cultists sharing the building). The house has been searched, emptied of its contents and boarded up.  A merchant named Fuchstun owns the building, and is searching for new tenants, but the place has acquired an evil reputation, and no one has been eager to move in.</p>\n<p>Anybody asking after the building’s former occupants will be suspected of being Chaos-worshippers themselves. The Characters may draw their own conclusions from this: if nothing else, it should persuade them to open the crate and letter, if they have not already done so, and that in turn should give them a good idea about Blucher’s motives in sending them here.</p>\n<p>Captain Scharlach, of course, never existed. As explained on @JournalEntry[hilEMhOF52SCjG6s]{The City}, his name is one of several code-names used by members of the Purple Hand. For example, if someone ever asks for Herr Verandern, it means they are a cult member looking for others. To ask for Captain Scharlach means ‘I have been sent here by another cult member, and I have no idea what’s going on.’</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/skull-spot.webp\" width=\"176\" height=\"173\" /></div>\n<h3>A New Direction</h3>\n<p>As the Characters stand, bewildered, by the empty building — perhaps recalling that a similar building was used to ambush them in Bögenhafen — they may notice that they are being watched. A young guttersnipe, fairly typical for the area, is looking at their crate from across the street, and seems to be trying to decide something. Once any character catches his eye, he ambles across to them.</p>\n<p>‘That for Captain Scharlach?’ he asks, as if it is the least important thing in the world. He cannot read, and will respond contemptuously to anyone who directs him to the large and obvious address label on the crate. If the Characters confirm that they are looking for the captain, the boy nods.</p>\n<p>‘He sent me to watch for you,’ he says, ‘on account of he thought he was goin’ to be livin’ here, but there was some mix-up, and them as was here already wasn’t lookin’ to move out after all. Not till them witch hunters persuaded them otherwise, anyhow.’ If the Characters point out that the house is empty now, the boy snorts in contempt.</p>\n<p><em>‘Just off the coach, are yer? I can tell. What would a man like the Captain want with this place now, with all the neighbours pointin’ an’ whisperin’? ’E’s ‘is reputation ter consider, after all. Come on, I’ll take yer to ’im.’</em> Without looking to see whether the Characters are following, the boy sets off down a side street. If the Characters are late with the delivery, he makes a few choice comments about having had to wait and watch for several days, and observe that some folk have no consideration, what with his time being valuable.</p>\n<p>He tosses these comments over his shoulder as he walks, always several yards ahead of the Characters — by the time they have picked up the crate again, he has a good head start — and after a couple of turns down ever-narrower streets, the Characters turn another corner to find an alley in front of them and their guide nowhere in sight. As they head down the alley, looking right and left for any sign of him, four cultists move to block the street behind them, and four more in front. Each one wears something purple.</p>\n<h3>The Ambush</h3>\n<p>The attackers consist of seven cultists and one cult priest: a Cult Magus, who is with the group that stands behind the Characters. The cultists in front of the party hold crossbows on them, while those behind wield clubs and axes.</p>\n<p>‘<em>Kastor Lieberung</em>!’ the @Actor[iDtTX0rKFDqJA8hQ]{priest} calls out — having never seen the Magister Impedimentae personally, he has no idea which character he is addressing — ‘<em>Come with us and repent before the Magister Magistri, and your companions can live</em>!’ If the Characters do not comply, the @Actor[G3DW990j07OftQut]{cultists} attack.</p>\n<p>It is possible that the Characters can talk themselves out of being shot on the spot, as the cultists are reticent to shoot ‘Kastor Leiberung’ when they are so close to delivering him to the cult’s leadership. His companions, on the other hand, are fair game — as soon as the cult is sure of who Kastor is, they will shoot anyone else who refuses to go along with them. Tales of the slippery Magister and his co-conspirators have spread throughout the cult, and they have no intention of letting him vanish again.</p>\n<h3>Captured!</h3>\n<p>If the Characters lose this encounter, they will be bound and taken to a Purple Hand safe house to await the judgement of the Magister Magistri. As will be seen, however, he is busy with other things during Carnival week.</p>\n<p>During their incarceration in the cellar of an abandoned house, the Characters may overhear their captors speak about ‘the great work’ that is currently underway. They may also learn that the Borks, burned as cultists, were members of the Purple Hand who were assigned to the Hoffen Strasse house to lie in wait for the Magister Impedimentae. The Borks bravely sacrificed their lives without giving up any of their fellow cultists, and the capture of Kastor Lieberung is a tribute to their loyalty. </p>\n<p>The Characters will soon release that no help is coming, so they will have to take measures to free themselves. ‘Kastor’ may be able to talk their way out of trouble, but stealth, cunning, or violence may be called for. </p>\n<p>Be sure not to let too much of the Carnival go by while the Characters linger in imprisonment. If they need some encouragement to arrange a daring escape, have a few members complain loudly about the cost of feeding so many prisoners when Kastor is the only one they <em>really </em>need.</p>\n<h3>The Black And Blue Hand</h3>\n<p>If the Characters defeat the cultists, there will be no further attacks while they are in Middenheim. The whole strength of the Purple Hand in the city is standing by for the news that the Graf is theirs, at which signal they will each perform an assigned task; an assassination here, a house-burning there, and other crimes that will help cement the cult’s hold on the city.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-ambush.webp","folder":"9l20ogJKAnhkPnIw","sort":575000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":575000}}}

It is a busy, well-maintained thoroughfare with traffic to and from Bretonnia, the mountain Dwarf Holds, and the free territory of Frugelhorn.

It&rsquo;s driven by a group of anxious roustabouts led by Giuseppe da Ezzalio, a charismatic showman (and petty magic user) who can&rsquo;t contain his excitement. They&rsquo;re carting a subdued Troll to Ubersreik for the pit fight to end all pit fights.

Despite having spent much of his adult life putting witches and mutants to the torch, he found himself unable to submit himself for likewise treatment when his feet spontaneously grew into a pair of silver scaled flippers. Klaus wears an oversized pair of boots to hide this affliction, and considers the pain this brings him to be sufficient penance. However, a local woman named Hilda Borgenfeur uncovered his secret after noticing the former witch hunter soaking his unnatural appendages in a pool one fine evening. Aware that making the accusation alone will surely end badly for her, and otherwise eager to put an end to what she sees as excessive religiosity, Hilda wishes to use the Characters to unmask the mutant. Will they help her? And if successful, what will they do when it is revealed that most of the townspeople already knew?</p>\n</blockquote>"}

{"_id":"hKPhEfRrJZM9iaSM","name":"Bringing Your Character To Life","content":"<p>Fleshing out your Character&rsquo;s personality and history will really help you bring them to life. Some players write detailed backstories for their Character, especially if they are very familiar with the Old World. Others prefer to just decide the basics at the start, and then improvise during the game (discuss this with the GM beforehand so you don&rsquo;t derail any storylines). At the start of the Character creation process we recommended that you talk to the other players and the GM about the kind of group you want to create, and we revisited that while creating Party ambitions. This is the perfect place to complete that process, weaving your Characters&rsquo; stories together and binding them into a tight-knit group with their own reasons for sticking together.</p>\n<h3>Ten Questions</h3>\n<p>One useful technique for creating an interesting background for your Character is to answer a series of questions about them &mdash; here are ours! If any of these questions make you want to change something about the character you&rsquo;ve created so far... do so! For instance, if you add in some detail about your childhood, you may want to revisit the choices you made in @JournalEntry[Skills and Talents]{4) Skills and Talents}.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Where are you from?</h4>\n<p>Do you come from one of Reikland&rsquo;s bustling towns, or a sleepy village? Perhaps your childhood was spent on a remote farmstead, or maybe you called the winding back alleys of Altdorf home? Do you hail from a deep mountain hold, or were your days spent threading the roads and riverways of Reikland, always on the move?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>What is your family like?</h4>\n<p>It may take a village to raise a child, but it&rsquo;s your kin who do the heavy lifting. What were your parents&rsquo; occupations? Are they still alive? Do you have any siblings? Were you close, or were you constantly at one another&rsquo;s throats? Grandparents? Nephews, nieces, cousins? Children, even? Does your family approve of your career choice? Are they proud of you, or are you a stain on your family&rsquo;s honour?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>What was your childhood like?</h4>\n<p>Was your family home full of love, or was it a cold, inhospitable place? Were you coddled, or did you have to fend for yourself? Were you educated, and if so, by whom: a tutor, a family member, a village school, or the local priest? Were you trained in the family business, or were you sent from home, fostered elsewhere or raised in an orphanage?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Why did you leave home?</h4>\n<p>Do you still live in your childhood home, or did you leave? If so, when? Were you drawn by the promise of excitement of life in the big city? Are you in search of riches, or renown? Are you running from something, or trying to find meaning or purpose in your life?</p>\n<h4>Who are your best friends?</h4>\n<p>While you cannot choose your family, your friends are another matter entirely, and you can tell a lot about someone by the friends they keep. Do you have any friends from childhood? Or friends you&rsquo;ve made since leaving home? What do you do together? Drink? Gamble? Debate? Are your allies in your party your best friends? Or do you eschew civilised company in favour of a loyal pet?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>What is your greatest desire?</h4>\n<p>What is the fire that burns in your heart? Your Ambitions may be your chief goal, but ambitions are often prosaic or banal. If you could have anything, anything at all, what would it be?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>What are your best and worst memories?</h4>\n<p>We are the sum of our experiences; they shape and mould us, forging us anew. What are your most treasured memories? An afternoon of glorious summer sunshine? A passionate kiss, while huddling from rain, beneath sheltering boughs? A victory scored in a battle of wits or brawn? And what are your less fond recollections? A painful humiliation? A scheme thwarted? The end of a long-term partnership, romantic or business? The hatred, disdain, or, worse, disinterest of your peers?</p>\n<h4>What are your religious beliefs?</h4>\n<p>Most folk of the Empire are polytheistic; the existence, and puissance, of the gods is undeniable, and so their veneration is a matter of course. That being said, not all of the gods are favoured equally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Does your character have a fondness or affinity for one god in particular? Do you cross your fingers for luck, appealing to Ranald? Do you make the sign of the Twin Tailed Comet at your enemy, or mutter an angry prayer to Ulric before battle? See Chapter 7: Religion and Belief for details of the gods and their ways.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>To whom, or what, are you loyal?</h4>\n<p>Will you protect your friends above all, or are the ties that bind you to your clan, kinfolk, or partner stronger than iron? Or are you a pious soul, dedicated above all to your god? Or are you loyal to your community, to Reikland, the Empire&hellip; or just to yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Why are you adventuring?</h4>\n<p>And this is the big one: why are you a player character, and not just another citizen of the Empire. Why are you adventuring?</p>\n<p>Have you consciously chosen a life of adventure? Are you seeking out the enemies of the Empire, or a big pay day? Or was this life thrust upon you, against your will. Are you seeking justice, or vengeance, or is your adventuring life nothing more than a fight to clear your name, or survive your enemies?</p>\n<p>Answer all of those, and you will have a fully fleshed out character, ready to go. But, before you start playing, did you gain any bonus XP during the character creation process? If so, you may wish to spend it before you begin play.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Options: Psychology</h3>\n<p>When you are creating your Character&rsquo;s story, you might feel you should have powerful emotions such as Love, Camaraderie, Hatred etc towards family members, situations, enemies or other features of their life. If the GM agrees, you can take a Psychology trait.</p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"Q0UfttGS2ZpKyqfG","sort":400001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Character"}}}

Kirsten is usually with @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}; Petra frequents expensive hostelries by night, often with a rich and handsome NPC; Natasha escorts VIP visitors around the Palace and to the more highbrow Carnival events.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Kirsten has a soft heart, and her opinion of people varies depending on how she percieves their motives. Characters who present themselves as kindly or concerned benefit from +10 to Fellowship when dealing with Kirsten — those who present themselves as self interested or malign suffer a -20 to Fellowship Tests. How Kirsten percieved a Character's moral fibre is at the GM's discretion, though she tends to be a good judge of character.</p>\n<p>With Petra, any Character with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.6l3jvIAvrKxt0lA9]{Attractive} Talent gains the full benefit of this trait. </p>\n<p>With Natasha, all Fellowship Tests are unmodified, but she will never show any Character any real warmth or friendship.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Kirsten knows little of use, but has influence with @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} and their friends (for example @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} and @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel}).</p>\n<p>Natasha knows who influences the Graf, but no more.</p>\n<p>Petra knows a great deal of useful gossip, but she must be approached in the right way: gold is sordid; jewellery is always welcome; and a favour for a friend is best of all.</p>\n<p>She knows who influences the Graf.</p>\n<p>The @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} recently made advances to her: this uncharacteristic behaviour may make the Characters curious.</p>\n<p>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle} is the Graf ’s paramour. Petra dismissed the idea that she is having an affair with @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}, but if a Character mentions it, she might say, ‘I wondered about that.’</p>\n<p>She knows about @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich’s} nephew (see ‘@JournalEntry[mNMoXXZJKYGjXH7O]{The Harmacist}').</p>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} has a crush on the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Princess}. He is not behind the Dwarf Tax: it is not his style, and he lacks any political allies.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Petra and Natasha both know who influences the Graf. Kirsten over-estimates @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric’s} influence.</p>\n<p>Goals</p>\n<p>Kirsten is looking forward to marrying @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} and leaving court for a quieter life. However, she is worried about the growing tension in court circles.</p>\n<p>Petra is focused entirely on her pursuit of good times and lavish presents.</p>\n<p>Natasha longs to increase her influence, and may pretend to be more influential than she really is.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Kirsten and Natasha ignore him. Petra was surprised when he propositioned her recently. She dislikes him, but thinks he may become a good source of presents. The Chancellor has forgotten the incident, and currently harbours a secret crush on the unknowing Natasha.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Kirsten loves him, but thinks his support of the new taxes is odd — as is his refusal to discuss the matter with her. Petra likes him, but only for Kirsten’s sake: he is a little dull for her taste. Natasha dismisses him as weak for his decision to leave the court.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Kirsten knows him through @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, and likes him. Petra likes his music, and she has met many useful people at his parties: knowing his romantic nature, she considers him a possible source of future interest. Natasha dislikes him for his frivolity.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘The Princess’</strong>: All three resent Katarina’s condescending attitude: Kirsten responds with irritation; Petra with elegant put-downs; and Natasha with icy coldness.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: Heartily disliked by all of them. Natasha has considering putting poison in her drink.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Few dealings. Kirsten knows them slightly through Dieter, and liked von Genscher after a brief meeting, but is neutral otherwise. Petra is regularly escorted by one or other of them, and is currently toying with von Genscher’s son Anton. Natasha dismisses them, especially since they avoid politics.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: No dealings, except that Petra has enjoyed a few drinks with Deputy High Wizard Janna Eberhauer.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[O1WGhtHQNazslML1]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}: Kirsten</strong> is devoted to Shallya and dislikes the martial cult of Ulric, but has nothing against the High Priest personally. Petra has noticed his recent discomfiture and wonders about him and @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle}, but doubts they would be so stupid. Natasha would like to see his downfall, except that it would mainly benefit the cult of Sigmar, which she dislikes even more.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: Kirsten is somewhat friendly with Emmanuelle, and suspects nothing of her involvement with the Graf or Ar-Ulric. Petra and Emmanuelle have similar personalities and get on well, but are not close; Petra knows about the Graf and wonders about Ar-Ulric. Natasha strongly suspects that Emmanuelle is Graf Boris’s paramour, and is jealous of the power this must give her; she knows nothing of the affair with Ar-Ulric.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ladies at Court</strong>: The Ladies at Court share a certain esprit de corps, and despite their differences are generally reluctant to attack each other. Kirsten and Petra have a superficial friendship. Kirsten respects Natasha, while Petra ignores her. Natasha regards them both as rivals.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Kirsten thinks him harmless and not a bad sort; Petra thinks him a fool; and Natasha despises him for his tedious manner and small intellect.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Kirsten and Petra both like him as a companion about town, and Petra enjoyed an occasional dalliance with him in the past. Natasha dislikes him, taking his open sociability for a lack of discrimination.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Kirsten does not know him. Petra is disgusted by him, having found that he requires ‘favours’ in return for anything — even a drink. Natasha disliked him at first glance.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Kirsten has met him once or twice, and finds him alarming. Petra found his company stimulating but exhausting. Natasha had a brief fling with the man, and was left somewhat bitter by the affair.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: No dealings, although Natasha would like to be closer to such politically powerful men.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer: </strong>Do not know him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Kirstin Jung is careful to be polite to Breugal, but does not know him as a person. Petra Liebkosen thinks him ridiculous, and sometimes cannot resist teasing him in one way or another. Natasha Sinnlich is aware of the subtle power that Breugal wields within the palace — more aware than Breugal himself, in fact — and has begun the long process of cultivating him as an acquaintance.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>As most of the city’s middle- and upper-class weddings happen in the @JournalEntry[bBgwBPu0zugAPooq]{Temple of Verena}, Kirsten approached the priestess to arrange her forthcoming nuptials. She was pleasantly surprised by the Verenan’s welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>Kirsten Jung is a follower of Shallya and values the priestess’s counsel and spiritual guidance.

Natasha is the hardest of the three to befriend, and any PC who tries to do so had better have something to offer in terms of her vaulting political ambitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Natasha provides letters of introduction to almost anyone at court, if she believes that the Characters are giving her something even more valuable in return — and she reckons value in terms of power rather than money. </p>\n<p>Kirsten is worried about @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}. She introduces the Characters to any of her friends and acquaintances who might be useful allies in dealing with whatever has been done to him; stories of plots against the city go over her head somewhat, unless the Characters can clearly show how Dieter’s change in personality is a part of the larger plan. </p>\n<p>Petra can introduce the Characters to the other ladies and to the two Elves, as well as to @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Doktor Pavarotti}, if she thinks the Characters are sufficiently broad-minded to benefit from his acquaintance. Her secret relationship with Anton von Genscher, the @Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Midden Marshal’s} son, and her habit of being squired around town by one or more young military officers, also gives her an indirect means of providing introductions to the @JournalEntry[9QmzxmgtDbdsPiSv]{Midden Marshals.}</p>","folder":"YbdT1wAfqZmWtR79","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":100000}}}

{"_id":"hilEMhOF52SCjG6s","name":"The City","content":"<p>Dwarfs and Wizards were among Middenheim’s first settlers. Dwarfs were instrumental in building the striking City of the White Wolf, ensuring the foundations they laid were built to last — they don’t let anyone forget their contribution to the city’s solid infrastructure either, ever.  Its imposing architecture shows many Dwarf influences, from the dark-grey uniform stone they quarried tirelessly from the rock below to the intricate knotwork carvings that are visible across the city.  Middenheim is still home to a large Dwarf population, who take immense pride in their continued contribution to the city’s construction. </p>\n<p>Early rulers also encouraged wizards to settle there, valuing their help in both construction and defence — for the Drakwald was even less tame then than it is today. Welcomed by the city’s rulers and accepted by their neighbours, wizards and alchemists flocked to the city, cementing its reputation as a centre of learning and research.</p>\n<p>The sturdy hardwoods of the Drakwald and the dark-grey stone of the Fauschlag, the great plateau of rock on which the city is built, give Middenheim’s buildings a certain uniformity. The city is known for its talented stonemasons and builders, and to a man (and Dwarf ) they take great pride in constructing buildings that last: it is said that there is not one building in Middenheim without a plaque stating who built it and when.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<p><em>A joke from Altdorf makes light of this tradition:</em></p>\n<p>Q: What’s the best feature of a Middenheim building?</p>\n<p>A: It lasts forever.</p>\n<p>Q: What’s the worst feature of a Middenheim building?</p>\n<p>A: It lasts forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Middenheimers retort that Altdorf ’s builders favour style over substance, and like to claim with a deadpan stare that ‘Ours stay up longer!’</p>\n<p>The rock on which Middenheim stands is honeycombed by the mines and tunnels of the early Dwarf settlers. The Undercity is the realm of the Dwarfs, who form a first line of defence against any threat from below.</p>\n<h3>A Brief History</h3>\n<p>Humans of the Teutogen tribe were the first settlers, who reached the top of the rock with the help of a Dwarf clan. Dwarfs have been an important part of Middenheim’s population ever since. The Teutognens built a temple to Ulric at the heart of their settlement.  Over the centuries and millennia that followed, both temple and city prospered and grew. Today, the city of Middenheim covers the whole of the rock, and the Temple of Ulric is second only in size to the great Temple of Sigmar in Altdorf.</p>\n<p>Surrounded by the wild and untamed Drakwald, the City of the White Wolf has come under attack many times, but its massive, Dwarf-built fortifications and its hardy, stubborn people have withstood every foe. The worst attack took place in 1118 IC, on the heels of a devastating outbreak of Black Plague that killed three quarters of the Empire’s population. The Skaven swept across the devastated Empire as soon as the plague abated in 1112 IC, finally coming to a halt at the foot of the Fauschlag. The ratmen besieged the city, turning their most terrible weapons on the city’s fortifications and tunnelling up through the rock beneath it.</p>\n<p>The city’s walls withstood everything the Skaven could throw at them, and Dwarf tunnel fighters held the undercity with outstanding bravery and resilience. The siege failed, and Count Mandred von Zelt mounted a counter-attack. His forces burst out of Middenheim like a thunderbolt, shattering the demoralised besiegers and chasing the Skaven army across the Empire. Every victory brought more people flocking to Mandred’s banner, and by the time he slew the Skaven warlord Vrrnik of Clan Mors at the Battle of the Howling Hills in 1124 IC, the whole of the Empire was behind him.</p>\n<p>Dubbed ‘Ratslayer’, Mandred became Emperor and set about rebuilding the Empire. The skull of the fallen Warlord was wrought into an enchanted helmet of terrifying aspect that remains one of the city’s treasures to this day. Housed safely in the vaults of the Middenpalaz, displayed on a large stone plinth, the skull is a prized relic of Middenheim’s military history. </p>\n<p>When Mandred was assassinated in 1152 IC, the Electors were unable to agree on a successor, beginning a period of uncertainty that lasted for more than a thousand years. Through the Age of Wars, no one dared attack the impregnable fortress-city. When Graf Heinrich was forced out of Altdorf in 1547 IC after declaring himself Emperor — and beginning the period known to historians as the Age of Three Emperors — he naturally retired to Middenheim. The Empire came close to breaking apart, and Middenland might have become a separate state if the western part of the province had not rebelled against Middenheim and declared allegiance to another self-styled Emperor based in Nuln.</p>\n<p>It took an invasion by the forces of Chaos in 2301 IC to reunite the fragmented Empire. Once again, Middenheim survived a prolonged siege, and when Magnus the Pious led his great army there in the following year, the City of the White Wolf became a vital staging-post for the campaign to free Kislev from the Chaos hordes.</p>\n<p>The last two centuries have been comparatively tranquil. Dwarf tunnel fighters and Human sewer jacks still patrol the undercity and deal with the occasional threat. Like his predecessors, the Graf sponsors regular expeditions into the Drakwald to keep its population of beastmen and other monsters from reaching dangerous levels. Meanwhile the city has quietly prospered through trade, pilgrimage, and academic prestige. Trade of metal ore, slate and minerals from the Middle Mountains, flows profitably through the city and out across the Empire. </p>\n<p>Followers of Ulric flock to the city’s great temple from far and wide. Pilgrims in need of sustenance and a place to rest their virtuous heads line the pockets of many satisfied tavern owners, hawkers and stallholders selling cheap mementoes. The city’s traditionally liberal attitude has attracted scholars and wizards, raising the Collegium Theologia from its origins as a school for Ulrican priests to one of the Empire’s great universities.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/skaven-guards.webp\" width=\"250\" height=\"215\" /></div>\n<h3>The People</h3>\n<p>Middenheimers take after their city: proud, hard, and pragmatic. This makes the city especially attractive to Dwarfs — but to outsiders, the people of Middenheim can often appear rude.</p>\n<p>For example, here is a newcomer to the city, asking for directions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Q: Excuse me — sorry to bother you, but I seem to be lost. I wonder, would you be so kind as to direct me to the Royal College of Music?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To a Middenheimer intent on their own business, all the fine speech is redundant. They will be several paces away before the newcomer can even finish the question. If the Middenheimer is in a particularly forgiving mood, the questioner may be treated to a ‘No’ flung over one shoulder in passing.</p>\n<p>Here is how it is done in Middenheim.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Q: Royal College of Music?</p>\n<p>A: First left, second right!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Middenheimers are noted for their love of privacy, and resent intrusion of any sort. This gives the city a quietly liberal air, since most people mind their own business and make a point of not interfering in other people’s affairs. No one has to like their neighbours, but everyone is expected to tolerate everyone else, so long as the favour is returned in kind. This attitude changes during Carnival Week, however, when the city and its people welcome all manner of visitors and take an intense interest in the festivities and revellers alike — but more of that later.</p>\n<p>Middenheim’s large Dwarf community attracts many  Dwarf travellers, either relatives visiting their clan or Dwarfs new to Middenheim but curious to visit the impressive city. They can often be seen wandering the city in family groups, visiting buildings constructed by their ancestors or the ancestors of their relatives. Resident Dwarfs mainly work as engineers, builders, and skilled artisans of other types. Dwarfs have a long and honourable involvement with the city, and this is reflected in the respect they are generally accorded by Middenheim’s other inhabitants.</p>\n<p>The other species feel less at home here. Halflings are the next most common, and generally work as cooks and innkeepers, although the @JournalEntry[oKACPU6FEgy3Yb5r]{Kleinmoot} district is home to a considerable number of Halfling artisans. Middenheim’s culture does not encourage their natural friendliness and love of gossip, so most of the city’s Halflings prefer the company of their own kind.</p>\n<p>For all its friendliness toward wizards, Middenheim is a hard city for an Elf to live in. The stark and unlovely architecture, the large numbers of dour and grumpy Dwarfs, and the prosaic, workaday culture make the city cold and unwelcoming. With that said, however, a few Elves have found very comfortable positions in the households of the city’s upper classes, where their culture and artistic talents are admired.</p>\n<h3>Government</h3>\n<p>Middenheim is ruled by Graf @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Boris Todbringer}. He is supported by a powerful group of advisors and confidants, who are detailed in <strong>Chapter 5</strong>. The Graf maintains direct rule over a radius of some 30 miles from the city proper, and also governs the province of Nordland.</p>\n<p>Under the Graf, several organisations and individuals are responsible for various aspects of the city’s day-to-day operations.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/powers-that-be.png\" width=\"473\" height=\"382\" /></div>\n<h3>The Graf</h3>\n<p>The Todbringer line is very distinguished: its name is recorded in the earliest writings of the Teutogen people. Graf Boris married young, taking the elegant Maria von Richthofen as his bride. One year later, Maria died giving birth to @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan}, the Graf ’s only legitimate child and his legal heir.</p>\n<p>Only a few months previous to Stefan’s birth, the Graf fathered an illegitimate son, Heinrich, with a Lady-at-Court. It has been rumoured that Heinrich was conceived the night before the Graf ’s marriage to Maria.</p>\n<p>A sickly child, Baron Stefan became increasingly distant and quiet  as he grew. Today, he seems to understand little of what goes on around him, and is incapable of coherent speech. He spends most of his time staring blankly into space. Even so, he is the Graf ’s sole legal heir.</p>\n<p>@Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich}, on the other hand, grew into a vigorous and capable young man. The Graf officially recognised him as his son, and gave him a title and lands, but Heinrich is still barred from the succession. He is currently away from the city, but takes a great interest in events there.</p>\n<p>The Graf ’s daughter @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina}, affectionately known as ‘the Princess’, was born to another Lady at Court. Again, the Graf officially recognised her, and granted her the title of Baroness. But like Heinrich, the circumstances of Katarina’s birth bar her from the succession — leaving Stefan as the sole legal heir to one of the highest titles in the Empire.</p>\n<p>For this reason, ten years ago the Graf, then 37, took a second wife: the beautiful Anika-Elise Nikse, daughter of Baron Rudolph von Niske of Nordland. It was no secret that the offspring of this marriage would be heir to Middenheim. Unfortunately, the marriage was unfruitful. Anika-Elise died from a strange illness a few months ago.</p>\n<p>Following her death, the Graf has sunk into a deep depression, leaving more and more of the tasks of government to his trusted advisors.</p>\n<h3>The Todbringer Family</h3>\n<p>What follows is a description of the men of the Todbringer family — 'Princess' @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina} may well play a more important role in the adventure, and is discussed in detail on her @JournalEntry[XY9dT0a5Tin6KKAs]{summary sheet}.</p>\n<p>@Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Boris Todbringer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan Todbringer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich Todbringer}</p>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>As might be expected, the main cult in Middenheim is that of Ulric. In addition to being the High Priest of the city’s temple to Ulric, and the head of the Empire’s second largest religion, Ar-Ulric is an Imperial Elector. The city’s huge @JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{Temple of Ulric} reflects the cult’s power and prestige within the city. While Middenheimers in general are not especially devout, almost all of them pray to Ulric to look after themselves, their families, and their city.</p>\n<p>Several other cults also maintain temples in Middenheim. Like every other Imperial city and town, Middenheim has a temple to Sigmar — although it is significantly smaller than the Temple of Ulric. Historical rivalries between the two cults — one local, the other national — have reached boiling point over recent months, and followers of Sigmar are not especially popular in the city.</p>\n<p>In addition, the cults of Verena, Shallya, and Myrmidia maintain temples in the city, and there is a shrine to Morr in the great cemetery of Morrspark. The city’s Dwarf community maintains a chapel to Grungni. While there is no formal temple to the Halfling goddess Esmeralda, every Halfling home and business in the Kleinemoot has a small shrine dedicated to her as well as to the spirits of the family’s ancestors.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/eternal-fire.webp\" width=\"624\" height=\"492\" /></div>\n<h4>Growing Tensions</h4>\n<p>Middenheim, and Middenland in general, have always been loyal to Ulric, and its people have always had a stubborn, independent streak that makes them slightly contemptuous of the airs put on by Altdorfers. Some look back with misplaced fondness to the Age of Three Emperors, and dream of an independent Middenland free from southern interference. Although Altdorf stands roughly in the middle of the Empire, many Middenlanders regard everywhere south of the Drakwald as ‘the south’ — a land of undeserved wealth and ease, populated by effete, untrustworthy, Sigmar-worshipping milksops.</p>\n<p>Always a palpable undercurrent in local attitudes to outsiders, in recent years these religious and social differences have grown to greater and more dangerous prominence. While most Middenlanders dismiss the vagaries of ‘southerners’ with a tut, a roll of the eyes, and the occasional pride-puncturing prank, a more militant attitude has been growing and spreading. Middenland separatists, long dismissed as romantic but harmless cranks, have become better organised and more vocal, winning increasing support among the poor and under-educated with their simplistic rhetoric and rose-coloured promises of independence. Carroburg, the southern capital of Middenland, is portrayed as being too close — physically and politically — to Altdorf, and these nationalists look to the city state of Middenheim as the natural capital of ‘free’ Middenland. </p>\n<p>In Middenheim’s streets and taverns, demagogues are speaking out with growing vitriol against southern control, promising that independence will divert endless rivers of tax revenue from Altdorf into the purses of ordinary Middenlanders — so much money, in fact, that the priesthoods of Ulric and Shallya will be able to treat every sick or injured person for free. Middenland will be free to treat with Marienburg, Kislev, and elsewhere, boosting prosperity further. As a result, goods from elsewhere in the Empire will be taxed, and those from other provinces will be banned from the guild membership, ensuring that every true Middenlander prospers.</p>\n<p>‘<em>Middenland for Middenfolk</em>’ has become the slogan for a bundle of policies, embraced with glee by elements of Middenheim’s poor as an excuse to attack and rob Altdorfers, Sigmarites, those of foriegn lands, and anyone else — including more moderate Middenheimers, whom they characterise as traitors and ‘Sigmorons’. The Sons of Ulric, once a tiny group of extremists who no one took seriously, have emerged as an umbrella organisation uniting a wide range of groups ranging from Human supremacists to Ulrican fundamentalists. Its leaders remain obscure, but demagogues and handbills all over the city spread its semi-coherent doctrine of independence, hate, and endless blame.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, the argument has taken on a religious bent. The faceless Imperial bureaucrats whose uncaring decisions keep honest Middenlanders poor — according to the rhetoric, at least — have become identified with the cult of Sigmar, while that of Ulric has become a focus for ‘true Middenlanders’ to rally around. While Ar-Ulric and the priesthood have refrained from entering the debate, militant Ulricans have whispered that Sigmar, born a mortal, is no more a god than Magnus the Pious, and that his official cult is a southern trick to keep honest, Ulric-fearing folk from power. The legendary figure of Mandred the Ratslayer has been invoked as a symbol of Middenland’s glorious past, and a particularly inflammatory rumour claims that his assassination was part of a Sigmarite plot, plunging the Empire into centuries of conflict rather than allowing a northern Emperor.</p>\n<p>Growing in numbers and increasingly organised, the @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{Sons of Ulric} and their affiliates have become bolder. Attacks on outsiders are becoming more frequent, especially outside the city: beatings and robberies have become common, and several bandit groups now fly banners with crudely painted Ulrican symbols as a justification for their violence. Within the city, a ‘truce’ has been declared for Carnival week, so that the world can see the traditional hospitality and tolerance that have long been proud Middenlander virtues. Apparently blind to the inherent hypocrisy, most militants confine themselves to comments and vague threats during this time, and avoid actual violence.</p>\n<p>So far, the city’s government and military commanders have taken no action in response to the growing wave of militancy and religious violence, although it is rumoured that the movement has begun to gain supporters in the rank and file of the Knights of the White Wolf, the largest Templar order of Ulric. It has even been suggested that they may exchange their traditional warhammers for axes, to separate themselves further from the cult of Sigmar, but official sources deny this.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>RUMBLINGS OF WAR</em></h3>\n<p><em>The increasing tensions between the Ulrican north and Sigmarite south will come to a head during the events of <strong>Empire in Ruins</strong>, the concluding chapter of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>. It is vital that this escalation towards a potential civil war in the Empire should feel like a natural outcome of simmering and unaddressed grievances, carefully stoked by individuals and groups with much to gain from  strife and warfare. Be sure to make frequent mention of this tension as the Characters play through <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. While the Carnival is a distraction from worldly concerns, demagogues and agitators can be found on every street corner speaking ill of Altdorf, The Emperor, Sigmar, and the current state of The Empire more generally. Have NPCs pepper in some references to their issues with Altdorf rule, and make sure to mention the graffiti that is cropping up around the city as well as children’s skipping rhymes and other doggerel heard in snippets around the streets. This need not take centre stage, but if you can establish an atmosphere of impending civil strife it will serve you well down the road.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Law and Order</h3>\n<p>Middenheim has a sophisticated legal system, and the practice of law is a profitable one. For this adventure, though, the GM need not worry too much. During Carnival week, many of the normal laws of Middenheim are largely ignored: since so many people converge on the city for the Carnival, the best thing to do with trouble makers is either to lock them up for the whole week, or to expel them on pain of death should they return. The latter sentence works on all but the most persistent miscreants!</p>\n<p>Individual Watch Captains are allowed a large degree of discretion — which some abuse — when it comes to minor disturbances. Provided the Characters do nothing seriously wrong, like insulting the Watch Captain, they should get away from any minor brawls with a simple warning. Of course, manslaughter (even in self-defence) is a serious matter. If evidence or witnesses can back up the party’s story, they escape immediate arrest — but the Watch keeps an eye on them, and further incidents may be dealt with more harshly.</p>\n<p>A standard Watch patrol consists of [[/r 1d10]] Watchmen led by an Elite Watchman. In wealthy areas, the patrol consists of a similar number of Elite Watchmen led by a member of the Knights Panther, the Graf ’s personal fighting force. This is slightly different from normal patrols, but during Carnival time everybody has to pitch in — even the Knights Panther.</p>\n<h3>Districts</h3>\n<p>The map at the front of this book shows the layout and some details of Middenheim. The city is home to stinking alleys as well as broad and leafy avenues, and the tone of a location will match that of the district in which it is located.</p>\n<p>More details on these and other locations may be found in <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</strong>.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[ORygEUMcd9ryf6Ny]{The Palast District}</h4>\n<p>The area around the @JournalEntry[16KsfNTgXYLtRib9]{Middenpalaz} is the most well-kept area of the city. The palace is home to @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris}, and several of his advisors and courtiers. The three @JournalEntry[9QmzxmgtDbdsPiSv]{Midden Marshals} have residences near the barracks either side of the @JournalEntry[asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials}.</p>\n<p>Watch patrols are extremely frequent in this area, and unless they look like wealthy residents the Characters automatically attract attention — so they had better have a good reason for being there!</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[8rK4NSrDXCpSKRSH]{Grafsmund} and @JournalEntry[aFOxMajVoBKRHinu]{Nordgarten} Districts</h4>\n<p>This upmarket neighbourhood is home to the city’s upper crust. Nobles, merchants, master artisans, and others live here in elegant mansions. Local residents include two of Middenheim’s most respected citizens: the Law Lords @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Reiner Ehrlich} and @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}. The third Law Lord, @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Joachim Hoflich}, lives in the Palace.</p>\n<p>Ever eager to be seen doing its duty, the Watch is very active here. Most residents prefer not to become embroiled in any disturbance or other incident, calling the Watch rather than dealing with ‘riff-raff ’ directly.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[limbxI1PZjhVzBy8]{The Ulricsmund District}</h4>\n<p>The houses in this upper-middle-class area are comfortable, but smaller than the mansions of Grafsmund-Nordgarten. Notable residents include Deputy Wizard @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}.</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt} and @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} Districts</h4>\n<p>The bustling Altmarkt is home to most of Middenheim’s foodstuff trade, and Halflings are a common sight here. The dark and squalid Altquartier is home to many of the city’s more disreputable inhabitants. Those who venture here are on their own. The Watch only comes here if absolutely necessary, and then it comes in force: at least a double-sized patrol of [[/r 1d10+8]] Watchmen led by two Elite Watchmen and a Watch Captain with the profile of a Knights Panther man-at-arms. Life is cheap here, and the locals kill without a second thought, knowing that dead men (and Dwarfs, Elves, and Halflings) tell no tales.</p>\n<p>Many of Middenheim's Halflings make their home in Altmarkt, in a sub-district known as the @JournalEntry[oKACPU6FEgy3Yb5r]{Kleinmoot}. While they struggle for official recognition, every Middenheimer knows that anyone asking after ‘The Halfling District’ should be directed here.</p>\n<p>Various illicit activities form a large part of the local economy, and one local den of inquity, @JournalEntry[mNMoXXZJKYGjXH7O]{The Pit}, is an important location in this adventure.</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[y4MpfiD6PHBOAdX0]{Southgate} and @JournalEntry[06LuFlBESLckr28m]{Ostwald} Districts</h4>\n<p>The Southgate is a poor but respectable residential area.  Residents are hardened by poverty but share a sense of honour and community. The same cannot be said of Ostwald. It is said to be as dangerous as the Altquartier, although Ostwald footpads generally stop short of killing their victims. Again, the Watch rarely patrols this area, and then only in force. People here keep what they know to themselves, unless they know something they can sell.</p>\n<p>Among Ostwald’s run-down buildings is the lair of @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} and her minions (see @JournalEntry[n2j6nlkc2s2LcieJ]{The Lair of the Pawns}): pawns of the adventure’s villain who will play a significant role in the adventure’s later stages.</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[ZWV1AbhVVbWfbEIz]{Neumarkt}, @JournalEntry[UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor} and @JournalEntry[jGfyLhox6OTD75oi]{Nordtor} Districts</h4>\n<p>Middenheim’s second major market, the @JournalEntry[ZWV1AbhVVbWfbEIz]{Neumarkt} deals in everything except foodstuffs. Locals maintain that if it can’t be found here, it’s probably illegal.</p>\n<p>The nearby @JournalEntry[UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor} is a lower-middle-class residential area, home to many of the city’s junior clerks and other professionals. With vibrant eating and drinking establishments, it draws a wide range of evening visitors. The Graf ’s Master of the Hunt, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}, maintains a residence in this bohemian district. To the north of Osttor is the @JournalEntry[jGfyLhox6OTD75oi]{Nordtor} district, which whilst still broadly respectable, has seen better days. The @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music} was founded here centuries ago.</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[hDeFkdQZ2g2fT0it]{Freiburg}</h4>\n<p>The area around Middenheim’s famed university, the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, is popular with academics, wizards, and priests. Students and artists also throng here to drink, talk (including some discussions that would be regarded as sedition in any other place), and test the patience of their more strait-laced neighbours.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{The Wynd}</h4>\n<p>The majority of houses in this artisans’ quarter are both home and workshop. The population consists mainly of mundane craftsmen such as cobblers and smiths. The residents have a strong sense of community, and hostile visitors may find that a whole street will not mind its own business if one of its traders appears to be in trouble.</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[EwI0966tcHzz44lk]{Westor} and @JournalEntry[9S51a44wvQCES1CR]{Sudgarten} Districts</h4>\n<p>This residential area is popular with priests, since there are three temples here. Residents tend to be slightly more pious than the average Middenheimer, but not uncomfortably so.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[QYipS3tpaNBDgKsN]{Geldmund}, @JournalEntry[ASLyIclZPJ32Od7U]{Kaufseit} and @JournalEntry[t1vYezDY0dOlA2yQ]{Brotkopfs}</h4>\n<p>Together, these three areas form the city’s commercial hub. Most merchants live in the residential @JournalEntry[QYipS3tpaNBDgKsN]{Geldmund} area, and walk to their places of business nearby. One of the larger homes is owned by @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}, the Chairman of both the Merchants’ Guild and the @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission for Trade, Commerce and Taxation} — though he is not often to be found here.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/powers-that-be.webp","folder":"I3oC0nvgqcMK078b","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 2: Middenheim","sort":0}}}

He won&rsquo;t be particularly warm towards the PCs, as the Altdorf City Watch have something of a bad reputation, and will follow them about the house if they make a search to make sure they don&rsquo;t steal anything. The butler will attempt to take the PCs&rsquo; coats, and ask them to wipe their boots before entering and then lead them to meet the master of the house. The PCs can attempt a <strong>Charm or Intimidate</strong> Test to persuade the butler to answer a few questions first, but this will have a -10 penalty due to his higher social status.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, if the PCs are minded to steal something, they can probably pilfer something worth a few shillings with a <strong>Challenging (+0) Agility or Easy (+40) Sleight of Hand</strong> Test, opposed by the butler&rsquo;s Perception of 40. After all, the butler will find it difficult to watch them all at once.</p>\n<h3>Questioning the master:</h3>\n<p>The master of the house is Friedrich Von Ottinger, although he&rsquo;ll probably expect the PCs to address him as &ldquo;your lordship&rdquo; or with a similar form of address. Friedrich will meet the PCs in the parlour, which is lavishly decorated with Arabyan carpets, embroidered wall hangings depicting hunts and countryside pursuits and similar trappings. There is a stuffed bear in the corner. It will be immediately obvious to the PCs that there are items of considerable value here, which have not been stolen.</p>\n<p>Friedrich been beaten about the head and face, and is using cloth to staunch the bleeding.</p>\n<p>He is seated in a stuffed armchair, but will not invite the PCs to sit. Friedrich will attempt to take charge of the conversation as far as possible, taking notes of their names and badge numbers before answering their questions. He will also ask whether any of them can read. If they insult him, or he finds their manner particularly impertinent, then he will threaten to raise the matter with their Watch Captain.</p>\n<p>Friedrich will tell the PCs that he was at his desk in the study, reading, when two masked ruffians burst in, assaulted him, and proceeded to steal every scrap of paperwork they could lay their hands on. One of the ruffians also stole a pair of silver goblets: Friedrich will note that these valuables bore the family insignia and should therefore be easily identifiable if the PCs are quick enough to locate them before the crests can be filed off. He will express his outrage at the villains&rsquo; conduct, which was compounded by statements from their leader (Helmut Schwarz, although Friedrich doesn&rsquo;t know this) that they were <em>&ldquo;only taking what they were owed&rdquo;</em> and that they would have gladly killed him but<em> &ldquo;you&rsquo;re worth more to us alive&rdquo;</em>.</p>\n<p>Friedrich will ask pointed questions about how the PCs intend to investigate the theft.</p>\n<p>Depending on their responses, he might openly question whether the Watch has the competence to handle the matter, or whether it would be best to hire private agents. He will be content for them to search the house (under supervision), and to question the servants, but will not allow them to interrogate any of his family.</p>\n<p>If the PCs seem competent, then he will offer them a cash reward for the safe return of his papers (a Gold Crown each sounds about right for my campaign, both because it&rsquo;s their job as watchmen to do it anyway and because I would prefer to keep the PCs relatively poor, but you may need to increase this if your players will expect more.) He will note that some of the papers are concerning state matters, and the others document his family&rsquo;s personal and commercial affairs, and offer payment is the PCs agree to return these to him directly. If the PCs need the hint, they can attempt <strong>Average (+20) Intuition</strong> Tests to note that he seems deeply concerned at the loss of these papers.</p>\n<h3>Searching the mansion:</h3>\n<p>Searching the office will confirm the information Friedrich has provided. There are mucky boot prints (it&rsquo;s raining heavily outside, and he streets are filthy) across the carpet. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test will allow a PC to identify that one of the robbers limped slightly, favouring his right leg. A chair has been kicked over, and that there are blood stains on the carpet consistent with the injuries Friedrich has suffered.</p>\n<p>The desk has been ransacked, all of the draws shaken out and emptied of papers. A painting (depicting a pastoral Reikland landscape) has been thrown to the floor, and a concealed wall safe hangs open behind it. The safe has also been emptied of papers, but it&rsquo;s possible that a page has come loose and is buried away at the back of the safe (spotting it requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test). If any of the PCs can read, they&rsquo;ll see that this paperwork is from a law firm (Vogel &amp; Stein), confirming receipt of funds that have been transferred from Friedrich Von Ottinger to a company called Obsidian Enterprises to fund a property purchase. Even if they can&rsquo;t read, they might recognise the law firm&rsquo;s letterhead with a <strong>Hard (-20) Lore (Reikland)</strong> Test or an <strong>Average (+20) Lore (Law)</strong> Test.</p>\n<p>Little effort has been made to steal other valuables. Some silverware was nonetheless taken (a pair of silver chalices that were in plain view on a tray in the office), but it this appears to have been an opportunistic theft. These goods should be easily identifiable, as they bore the family insignia.</p>\n<p>Making a broader search of the mansion will confirm that the robbers appear to have used a rope to scale the wall, and broken a first floor window to enter. It looks as though one of the window panes was removed, and one of the robbers then reached inside to unlatch the window. (The missing window pane has been &ldquo;star-glazed&rdquo;, which is to say that one of the robbers used the point of a knife to crack the pane and then pried it out, pressing a heavily greased sheet of brown paper against the exterior to pull away the shards of glass without making much noise. The term &ldquo;star-glazing&rdquo; refers to the star-like pattern of cracks in the glass around the hole.) PCs from any form of law enforcement background (or from a criminal or urban poor background) will recognise this as a common trick to steal from shop windows. The PCs will find the cracked pane of glass on the ground outside.</p>\n<h3>Questioning the servants:</h3>\n<p>Depending on the approach the PCs take, and what they ask, <strong>Fellowship</strong> Tests will probably be required for the PCs to piece together information from the butler and other servants. These will generally be <strong>Average (+20)</strong>. Failure probably means that the NPCs are too scared or confused to answer clearly, although they might also seek to defer questions to higher ranking servants, or ask the PCs to wait until the master returns.</p>\n<p>There were six robbers, all of whom appear to have been human males. They seemed to know where they were going, as they went directly to the servants&rsquo; quarters to ensure that no one sounded the alarm. Two of them then left, and headed straight for the master&rsquo;s office, while the other four stood watch over the servants with weapons drawn to make sure no one tried anything.

{"_id":"iYRSBxiVDDI8Eesv","name":"The Cult of Ulric","content":"<blockquote>\n<p><em>Old Wolf White Back prowls the hills, </em></p>\n<p><em>Belly craving fresh new kills.</em></p>\n<p><em>Bloody Blitzbeil wants him dead,</em></p>\n<p><em>So, it slices off his head!</em></p>\n<p><em>Old Wolf White Back howls out loud, </em></p>\n<p><em>To the cheers of Ulric’s crowd.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Along with Myrmidia, goddess of war, and Sigmar, deified founder of the Empire, Ulric is a warrior god. However, where Myrmidia stands for the science and art of battle and Sigmar for the righteous power to smite evil, Ulric’s domain is honour, bravery, and prowess. He despises cowardice and weakness, and expects his followers to display directness and independence in all walks of life.</p>\n<p>These differing philosophies can cause friction between the cults of the war gods. In particular Ulricans and Sigmarites have, if not contempt, then certainly a suspicion of each other. In most respects the two cults are in accord: both preach defiance of evil and respect might and power. Smaller philosophical differences between them — such as Sigmar’s placing mental resolve above physical strength, or Ulric’s emphasis on self-sufficiency rather than protection — can cause friction, but it is history rather than dogma at the root of the animosity. </p>\n<p>Before the coming of Sigmar, Ulric was the most powerful deity in the Old World. Indeed, it was the High Priest of Ulric who crowned Sigmar as the first Emperor almost 2,500 years ago. For centuries, the cult of Ulric refused to acknowledge Sigmar’s divinity and although most Ulricans now believe that Sigmar is as much a god as any other, sub-sects of the cult hold that Sigmar was nothing more than a mortal hero — and by implication that the entire Empire is founded on heresy. As well as this, the cult of Ulric begrudges the Sigmarites’ three Imperial votes to its one, believing that if any cult is to be prevalent it should be theirs. The most devout Sigmarites in turn are notoriously superstitious, and rarely hold any trust in anyone who is not a dedicated servant of Sigmar. </p>\n<p>In the case of the cult of Ulric, this suspicion is doubled by the Ulricans’ mistrust of the man-god, which, in the eyes of the cult of Sigmar, makes them highly suspect themselves. This mutual mistrust is mostly unfounded and relations between the two cults usually remain friendly, but on occasion the religious differences act as catalysts in other disagreements, turning the smallest bone of contention into a blazing conflict. This is particularly noticeable during Imperial elections, when the votes of the Grand Theogonist and two Arch-Lectors of Sigmar almost always go to the Grand Prince of the Reikland, while the High Priest of Ulric invariably supports an Ulrican claimant.</p>\n<p>Ulric’s relations with the other gods are mostly agreeable. In particular he has allies in Rhya and Taal as fellow deities of nature, and there exist many shrines dedicated to Ulric, Rhya, and Taal as the gods of the seasons. For the most part Ulric is a distant deity with little interest in the affairs of other gods. The cult of Ulric occasionally takes issue with that of Ranald, as the methods of the Trickster God are seen as underhand and dishonourable. There is marked rivalry with followers of Myrmidia, but this tends to manifest in competition and condescension rather than outright hostility.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>BROTHERS IN BLOOD</em></h3>\n<p><em>While not required, more on the Ulrican faith, its church and important sub-organisations and sects can be found in @JournalEntry[gAju4PEyv8GeeJQX]{Middenheim: City of the White Wolf}</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/white-wolf.webp\" width=\"301\" height=\"265\" /></div>\n<h4>Famous Ulricans of History and Legend</h4>\n<p><strong>Skoll</strong>: Legends say that Ulric walked the world in ancient days, doing great deeds and vanquishing heinous foes. In many of these tales he is assisted by helpers or companions, and the most famous of these is a huge spectral White Wolf, Skoll. According to Ulrican tradition, it is Skoll who chases the sun away each winter, and some say that the monstrous White Wolves that prowl the northern lands are his descendants.</p>\n<p><strong>Artur</strong>: Artur was the Teutogen Chieftain who discovered the Fauschlag in –50 IC and founded Middenheim on top of it. He became the nominal king of the Teutogen people and in his youth was seen as the archetype of a brave and fierce Ulrican ruler. He grew cruel and vengeful with age and was slain by Sigmar during the unification of the Empire.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Wulcan</strong>: Ar-Ulric Wulcan was the first to record many of the legendary acts of Ulric, responsible for turning what was up until this point an oral tradition into a consistent lexicon worthy of serious study. In 63 IC he was inspired by a series of visions. He saw Ulric summoning forth the Eternal Fire by smiting the Fauschlag with the butt of his axe, and he ordered Middenheim’s High Temple of Ulric to be built at the site.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Bronnstein</strong>: Trained at the Drakwald College of the Holy Wolf, an Ulrican seminary renowned for the piety of the priests it produces. Bronnstein is feted for displaying the courage and prowess expected of an Ulrican warrior, dying in battle fighting overwhelming foes as a Skaven raiding party attempted to storm the High Temple in 1116 IC.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Herrsher</strong>: He is remembered for the vigilance and dedication he displayed in rooting out evil in the heart of Middenheim itself. In particular he is credited for driving out the Doomlord Dieter Helsnicht in 1207 IC.</p>\n<p><strong>Grand Duchess Ottilia of Talabecland</strong>: Few rulers exemplify the divisions between Ulrican and Sigmarite as much as Otillia. She outlawed the cult of Sigmar in Talabecland and extolled the belief that Sigmar was never anything more than a mortal follower of Ulric. In 1360 IC she declared herself Empress, plunging the Empire into turmoil. Most Ulricans consider her reckless, but hardliners admire her and suggest that she ought to be thought of as the first Wolf Empress.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Krieger</strong>: He is remembered by many Ulricans as a devout and principled man, though others see him as a divisive and reactionary figure. He is remembered for relocating the centre of the cult of Ulric from Middenheim to Talabheim following an invitation from Grand Duchess Ottilia in 1360 IC.</p>\n<p><strong>Horros</strong>: Horros was a monstrous White Wolf who preyed upon the inhabitants of villages near Middenheim before being slain by a knight. To those unacquainted with Ulricans, it may seem strange that they remember the monster but have let the name of the knight who slew her pass from memory. Ulricans often pay great regard to those who force them into hardship.</p>\n<p><strong>Graf Siegfried the Significant</strong>: Siegfried is an inspiration thanks to his decision to declare himself the first of the Wolf Emperors in 1547 IC. Most Ulricans find his example to embody their core values of courage and independence.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Sehrhart</strong>: Another Ar-Ulric known for putting the tenets of his faith into practice by becoming an accomplished warrior. He is said to have personally slain as many as thirty Orcs at the Battle of Kleindorf in 1567 IC.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Franzsson</strong>: A controversial High Priest who accepted the minor Order of the Winter Throne into the arms of the main cult in 1975 IC. Members of the Order of the Winter Throne, known as Ragnarites, believe in depriving people of food in order to prepare for an Ulrican apocalypse. Critics of the order see its precepts as thin justification for wanton marauding.</p>\n<p><strong>Grand Master Kruger of the Order of the White Wolf</strong>: The bold and fierce Grand Master is credited with slaying Vlad von Carstein in 2025 IC. He did not kill Vlad forever though, and was later turned into one of the Vampire’s undead servants by way of revenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Grand Master Giger of the Order of the White Wolf</strong>: This leader of the Knights of the White Wolf contributed to the defeat of the Norse barbarians of Thiafi Swiftaxe in 2198 IC. Grand Master Giger and Grand Master Sechse of the Knights Panther both claimed credit for the success of the campaign, leading them into a long and bitter rivalry.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Kriestov</strong>: Another divisive Ar-Ulric. Kriestov is notorious for casting doubt on the legitimacy of Magnus the Pious in 2302 IC. He later repented of his scepticism, joined Magnus on campaign, and supported his election as Emperor. Many Ulricans regard him as a model of fair compromise, whilst others decry his inconstancy and regard him as a Sigmarite quisling.</p>\n<p><strong>Anraheir</strong>: An Amber Wizard who lived in Middenheim in 2367 IC. He was famed for the innovation of a number of spells and the creation of many magical items. A devout Ulrican, his works are regarded as magical rather than spiritual accomplishments, yet in their wild ferocity they embody his Ulrican heritage. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/ulric.webp\" width=\"290\" height=\"348\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/adherants.webp","folder":"fY94Q1dcxw2okwpa","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Cult of Ulric","sort":100000}}}

It is a trickster, concealing some of its plans from even its master — something which Tzeentch finds particularly laudable. It can take the form of other beings, from the tiniest of insects to the most massive of Greater Daemons. No one, save perhaps The Changer of Ways, knows the Changeling’s true form, for it goes cowled and cloaked when in its own shape: perhaps even the Changeling itself has forgotten it. Not only can the Changeling mirror the form of another, it can adopt mannerisms and personalities in so flawless a fashion that even the Dark Gods can be deceived. In all of creation there is only one entity that the Changeling cannot duplicate: the Chaos God Tzeentch himself. The Grand Schemer will not suffer any being to steal his identity, even for a moment.</p>\n<p>Afflicted with a low tolerance for boredom, the Changeling loves to play malicious tricks upon all about him. The Changeling’s handiwork is always obvious after the fact: indeed, part of the prank is to make the victim aware of the deceiver, but impotent to act against them. The Changeling roams wild throughout eternity, causing havoc where it may. Each meddling opens up more possibilities in the Great Game, and Tzeentch watches with amusement as the Changeling weaves his uneven tapestry of disruption. Once in an age, the Changeling might work at the direction of a Lord of Change or some other powerful minion of Tzeentch, but only when the prank takes its fancy and the consequences will be truly spectacular.</p>\n<p>@Actor[tYpH2H0xZ3odU5L1]{Changeling Of Tzeentch}</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>CHANGING WAYS</em></h3>\n<p><em>What are the impacts of using the Changeling in your game?

The Ordo Novitiae operates from Ulricsmund and concentrates on the north-western districts, the Ordo Impedimentae is based in Kaufseit and concentrates on the south-western areas, while the Ordo Terribilis is based in The Wynd area, with cells in the eastern districts.</p>\n<p>Three high-ranking cultists, known as Magistri, control the Ordos.

The Komission makes representations to @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords} on all laws that affect taxes, merchants, and trade, while the Guild represents the interests of the city’s merchants. He has maintained both positions (which are technically elected by a semi-democratic process) by a mixture of bribery, extortion, bootlicking, flattery, and threats.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Wallenstein lives in an outwardly modest town house in the @JournalEntry[t1vYezDY0dOlA2yQ]{Brotkopfs} district. It is rather less modest inside, although Wallenstein does not wish to draw attention to his considerable wealth. He is virtually never at home, and after much knocking the door will be opened — on a stout chain — by a hunchbacked servant, Adolphus, who will say that his master is away on business, even if he is in. He is equally hard to find at his various warehouses and businesses around the city. Wallenstein attends some Carnival events, mainly to rub shoulders with the upper classes, and might be encountered by chance amongst merchants in almost any part of the city. He avoids the unsavoury parts of the city, fearing a murder attempt by one of the many people he has swindled.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>No special modifiers, but bribes go a long way.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Wallenstein has a poor idea of who influences Graf Boris, thinking that only the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} and the @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords} have any real sway.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Wallenstein is motivated largely by money and pleasure.</p>\n<p>He likes that the tax changes do not affect the city’s merchants — and, naturally, has told the Guild that this is due to his influence! The Dwarf Tax puzzles him: they are a significant market. He suspects that Rallane has influenced the Graf, perhaps through some magical song; he has heard that Elves can do this kind of thing. He likes the Temple Tax, and hopes to profit if the temples are forced to sell off property and other assets. The Scroll Tax worries him: fewer wizards might mean fewer apprentices and students, who are easy recruits for the Jade Sceptre; on the other hand, smuggling magical equipment into the city could be profitable.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Careful toadying by Wallenstein has created a modest friendship. Delighted to be on good terms with the Chancellor, but considers him lacking in base cunning.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Rather fearful of him; he swindled him for a few crowns over a horse deal some months ago, and now regrets it.

It recruits among the city’s well-to-do pleasure-seekers, with scouts in most of the better hostelries and in the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}. Only the inner circle knows that the cult’s spiritual leader was the Graf ’s late wife, Baroness Anika-Elise Nikse. Since her untimely death, several senior members have plotted to replace her, including Gotthard. Meanwhile, the powerful Middenheim cell of the Purple Hand has seen an opportunity to weaken its rival.</p>\n<p>If confronted with proof of either of these secrets, Gotthard will bribe, beg, wheedle, offer unspeakable ‘favours,’ and do anything else that he thinks will get him off the hook — or at least, buy him time to arrange the Characters’ murder. The Characters might put him in their debt by rescuing him from various foes: rival Slaanesh cultists, Purple Hand agents, Witch Hunters, and even a group of Skaven in search of more Wittgenstein Warpstone. He has considerable resources and contacts in the city, but the Characters might think twice before forming an alliance with him: once he knows that someone knows his secrets, he will inevitably try to have them killed.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Recitals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Horse Fair}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 2}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 3}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 4}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Semi-Final 1}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Semi-Final 2}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Final}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 1)}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 2)}, </em>@JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>\n<h3>Gotthard at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} is fairly easy to meet if the Characters seem influential or if one of them is an attractive female Elf or Human. While easy, the process  is not very pleasant, as Wallenstein is clearly only interested in what he can get out of any relationship with the party — especially money, power, or pleasure. He has no interest in helping anyone but himself, and although he tries to hide his naked self-interest behind a charming façade, he is not terribly good at it.</p>\n<p>Wallenstein can be seen at many of the Carnival events, but  is rude and dismissive of any Characters who do not appear to be of any use to him. If he sees an opportunity, though, he becomes friendly and even obsequious, in proportion to what he thinks the Characters can offer him. The party may have an opportunity to rescue him from some angry NPC whom he has swindled. If they find him somewhere secluded, they might rescue him from a small group of Skaven, in a kidnapping attempt that foreshadows a successful attempt at the conclusion of the adventure, prior to the events of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, the next part of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>.</p>\n<p>Wallenstein has nothing to offer the Characters in advancing the plot of this adventure, but if the players have realised that he is really the last of the Wittgensteins, they may use their inquiries as a cover to interrogate him subtly about his ancestor Dagmar von Wittgenstein, the missing warpstone, and the cult of @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{The Jade Sceptre}. You can decide how much free rein to allow the Players in these inquiries, as they constitute distraction from the main plot of the adventure, and may delay the Characters’ progress fatally. Ideally, the Players should become convinced that their first priority is to save the Graf and the city, and that Wallenstein/Wittgenstein can wait until later: they cannot know at this point that ‘later’ never comes.</p>\n<p>However, it may be possibly for the Characters to convince, blackmail, or otherwise cajole Wallenstein into helping them in other ways. The Komission Convener enjoys his positions in the city, and the Jade Sceptre immensely. The idea of the Purple Hand bringing a terrible wave of change to this pleasant state of affairs would distress him. Though good Sigmar-fearing Characters would undoubtedly have to hold their noses, Wallenstein/Wittgenstein and the cult of the Jade Sceptre more broadly may provide an ally of convenience during the Carnival. Of course, Wallenstein would undoubtedly plan to have the Characters disposed of just as soon as the more immediate threat had been dealt with.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Once he becomes convinced that the Characters have something to trade, Wallenstein makes extravagant claims about his position and influence in the city, promising to arrange personal interviews with everyone from the Graf to the chief rat catcher. In fact, he cannot deliver on any of these promises, since most of the major NPCs either dislike him, or are unaware of his existence. He always makes sure that he gets what he wants before attempting to keep his side of any bargain, and then starts actively avoiding the Characters. If he finds himself with no other choice, he pens a hasty letter of introduction which is either be rejected outright or imposes a –20 penalty to any <strong>Fellowship </strong>Tests that the Characters make in a first encounter with the letter’s addressee.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/gotthard-wallenstein.webp","folder":"YbdT1wAfqZmWtR79","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}

{"_id":"iikC4AcL9GQl83wN","name":"The Cost of Living","content":"<p>As they wander the Empire, adventurers likely fill their purses with coins of all three denominations, perhaps poor one day, unexpectedly rich the next. However, outside adventuring, most lives centre on a single coin type as determined by @JournalEntry[Status]{Social Status}.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Those seeking to maintain their Status must also keep up appearances. After all, if you repeatedly appear as poorer than you are, others will unsurprisingly think you’re poor. In practice, dressing and eating as expected, and using trappings that are fitting for your station, is enough for most folks to simply accept you at face value. What this requires in practice is left up to the GM to determine, using the following as a guide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brass Tier</strong>: The poorest members of society are unlikely to see a gold coin in their lifetimes. They live humble lives, subsisting on plain foods and sleeping in shared rooms, and have little appearances to maintain. Indeed, peers are more likely to call them out for having airs and graces for spending too much on fine clothes and food than they are likely to note spending too little.<br><br></li>\n<li><strong>Silver Tier</strong>: The swelling middle-classes may use pennies for ale and gold for major purchases, but shillings are their standard currency. They dine well, sleep in comfortable beds, and wear good quality clothing.<br><br></li>\n<li><strong>Gold Tier</strong>: The wealthiest elites rarely bother themselves with pfennigs. They eat luxury foods, sleep on satin sheets, and always stand out from the crowd due to their expensive garb and trappings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For GMs preferring hard numbers, spending around half your Status every day is usually enough to maintain appearances, though you may be living a little frugally.

By Sigmar&rsquo;s grace, sit yourself down and have some cheese, there&rsquo;s nothing good for you out there!&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&ndash; @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.ePPk15Vxu9RxPtYV]{Dieter K&auml;segeier}, Cheesemonger, ex-Adventurer</p>\n<p>When your character takes an action, the GM will let you know what happens next. Sometimes, the GM will make a call based on your abilities and any other factors and decide that you achieved what you were attempting, or that you didn&rsquo;t. If the GM isn&rsquo;t sure of the outcome, or if the situation is significant or dangerous, they can resolve the action using the rules. There are a few options, as the Using Tests box shows. Tests compare a dice roll to one of the characteristics or skills on your character sheet and provide an outcome.</p>\n<h3>Simple Tests</h3>\n<p>Simple Tests are used when you need to determine if your character succeeds or fails at a simple task. Does Molli leap the churning stream? Can Wilhelm charm a lower price from the truculent merchant? Often, a quick yes or no answer to these questions allows your adventure to progress swiftly. The exception to this is when a failure would significantly impact the progress of the adventure, in which case you should use a Dramatic Test instead.</p>\n<p>To perform a Simple Test, you roll d100 and compare the result rolled to the Skill or Characteristic best suited to the action you are attempting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Note </strong>this test may be modified by the GM if it is notably easy or hard to complete (see @JournalEntry[Combat Difficulty]{Difficulty}).</p>\n<p>If you roll lower or equal to the Skill or Characteristic, the Test&rsquo;s outcome is a success, and your Character performs the task.</p>\n<p>If you roll higher than the Skill or Characteristic, the Test&rsquo;s outcome is a failure, and your Character does not perform the task.</p>\n<p>Whatever the outcome of the Test, after testing, the GM should describe what just happened so everyone understands how the Test has impacted the story.</p>\n<h3>Automatic Failure and Success</h3>\n<p>No matter how skilled or talented a character is, there is always a chance of failure. Equally, there is always a chance of success in <strong>WFRP</strong>, no matter the odds stacked against you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you roll 96&ndash;00 on any Test, it is always a failure. A failure occurs even if your modified characteristic or skill is 96 or higher. Similarly, if you roll 01&ndash;05 on a Test, it is always a success. A success occurs even if your modified characteristic or skill is less than 01&ndash;05.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Autosuccess? Not At My Table!</em></h3>\n<p><em>Not everybody likes a 5% chance of auto-success on any Test. Similarly, not everyone likes the same chance of auto-failures. If this describes you, then simply change the numbers to your taste. The most common alternative is 96&ndash;00 always fails, and 01 always succeeds.</em></p>\n<h3><em>Options: Tests Above 100%</em></h3>\n<p><em>Having exceptional abilities makes it quite possible that a modified Characteristic or Skill may be 100% or higher when tested. If this occurs in your game, you may wish to use the following optional rule to help represent such an awesome figure.</em></p>\n<p><em>A successful Test gains a bonus of +1 SL for each full 10% a tested Characteristic or Skill exceeds 100%.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz has a Charm Skill of 115%: her Fellowship characteristic of 80% plus her Charm advances of +35% (see Advances on page 47 for more on this); thus, if she succeeds at a Charm Test, she gains a bonus of +1 SL over an above what she earns by rolling or from any applicable Talents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Dramatic Tests</h3>\n<p>Simply knowing if you pass or fail is not always enough; sometimes, it is useful to know how well you succeed or how badly you fail a Test. This is especially the case when pitching your Skills against another (see Opposed Tests), which is often the case for magic and combat. So, when you want to know exactly how well or badly you have performed a Test, use a Dramatic Test.&nbsp; Another reason for choosing a Dramatic Test is when the progress of the adventure could depend on the Test. Dramatic Tests provide outcomes rather than straight success or failure, which means that even if the test is &lsquo;failed&rsquo; the adventure continues, albeit in a more challenging way than if you had achieved a success. Dramatic Tests are handled in the same way as Simple Tests, and still provide success or failure as outcomes, but the results have more detail. This detail is governed by Success Levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Success Levels</h4>\n<p>Success Levels (shortened to SL) are used to describe the effectiveness of a Test. To determine the SL of a Test, subtract the 10s number of the rolled dice from the 10s number of the Characteristic or Skill being tested, including any modifiers (see Difficulty for more on modifiers). The higher the SL, the better the outcome; the lower it is, the worse things have gone. Marginal results, where you succeed or fail a Test with +0 or &ndash;0 SL, could either be interpreted as succeeding or failing by a whisker, with minimal consequences either good or bad, or could give inconclusive results allowing you try again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Exactly how well you succeed or fail is shown in the Outcomes Table, which can be used to inspire descriptions of what just happened. Much like simple tests offer a yes or no in answer to &lsquo;do I succeed at this test?&rsquo;, dramatic tests also provide answers, just more of them.</p>\n<p>If you automatically succeed due to rolling 01&ndash;05 (see page 150), you score +1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>If you automatically fail due to rolling 96&ndash;00 (see page 150), you score &ndash;1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is lower.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Eichengard is careering across muddy fields atop his stallion, desperately fleeing the lands of a disgruntled noble when a wall blocks his passage. He decides to push his mount to jump, and the GM calls for a Dramatic Ride (Horse) test. Eichengard rolls 29 against his Ride (Horse) skill of 41. The 10s number of&nbsp;</em><em>the Skill being tested is 4, and the 10s number rolled was 2, so the test succeeds with +2 SL (4&ndash;2=2) and he clears the wall with space to spare. Buoyed by his success, Eichengard twists around in his saddle and makes the sign of the twin-tailed comet at the horsemen pursuing him. Unfortunately, this means he&rsquo;s not paying attention to where he&rsquo;s going. The GM calls for a Dramatic Perception Test, and Eichengard&rsquo;s player rolls 82, significantly higher than Eichengard&rsquo;s Perception skill of 39. The 10s number of the roll is 8, and the 10s number of the skill being tested is 3, so the test has failed with &ndash;5 SL (3&ndash;8=&ndash;5). He has failed rather badly. As Eichengard laughs at the increasingly distant guards sent to capture him, a low-lying branch slams hard into his side, knocking him flying.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Fast SL</em></h3>\n<p><em>Determining your SL involves some simple mathematics, so calculating it can slow play during fraught scenes. Fortunately, there is a fast way to calculate SL for those looking to keep their games as fast as possible. When you pass a Test, use the result of the tens die as your SL. So, if you passed a Test with a roll of 36, you score +3 SL. With this optional rule, the closer you roll to your tested Skill, the better, rather than rolling low being best. If a Test fails, you calculate SL as normal, taking your rolled tens die from your tested Skill to determine your negative SL.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Outcomes Table</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%; height: 158px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\"><strong>SL</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\"><strong>Result</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>Have You Succeeded?</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 30px;\">+6 or more</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 30px;\">Astounding Success</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 30px;\"><strong>Yes, perfectly!</strong>: The result is as good as it can be, perhaps with extra luck and fortunate coincidences thrown in!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">+4 to +5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Impressive Success</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>Yes, and&hellip;:</strong> You achieve your goal with style, exceeding your expectations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">+2 to +3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Success</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>Yes</strong>: You achieve a solid success.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">+0 to +1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Marginal Success</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>Yes, but&hellip;:</strong> You more or less achieve what you intend, but imperfectly, and perhaps with an unpredictable side effect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">-1 to -0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Marginal Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>No, but&hellip;:</strong> You marginally fail, perhaps accomplishing a portion of what you intended.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">-2 to -3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>No</strong>: You just plain do it wrong.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">-4 to -5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Impressive Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>No, and&hellip;</strong>: Not only do you mess up, but you also cause additional things to go wrong.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">-6 or less</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Astounding Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\">\n<p><strong>No, not in any way!</strong>: Everything goes wrong in the worst possible way.

They can also be used to add drama for all Tests, creating a game that feels epic in scope as extreme results become commonplace. If that describes your group, you could use the following optional rule.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal;\">Any Test scoring a success that also rolls a double is called a Critical, meaning you&rsquo;ve scored an Astounding Success from the Outcome Table; and any failure including a double is a Fumble, resulting in an Astounding Failure from the Outcome Table. This optional rule works well with Simple Tests, providing a fun addition to the yes or no results offered there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Difficulty</h3>\n<p>Not all Tests are equal. Climbing a fence is laughably easy but ascending the face of a sheer cliff is incredibly tough. To represent this, the GM assigns bonuses or penalties to Tests called the Difficulty . While published adventures define the difficulty for the GM &mdash; for example: calling for a <strong>Hard (&ndash;20) Research</strong> test &mdash; there are many instances where the GM has to determine them on the fly. Making judgments like this is one of the most common functions of the GM. For each Test, whether simple or dramatic, the GM should decide the Difficulty and then consult the Difficulty Table to determine the appropriate modifier. GMs may choose to assign even greater bonuses or penalties than those shown on the table, but such modifiers should only be used in extreme situations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Valentyn, a Jade Wizard, tries to find the tracks of an unruly stag he is hunting. Under normal circumstances, he would perform an <strong>Average (+20) Track</strong> Test with his skill of 41, thus test against 61; however, the GM decides that as the rain last night washed away most of the tracks the task is Very Hard and imposes a &ndash;30 penalty. Therefore, Valentyn has to roll 11 or under (41&ndash;30=11) to succeed. He rolls a 35, which would have been a success under normal circumstances, but in this circumstance is a failure, indicating the rain has foiled the Jade Wizard&rsquo;s attempt.</em></p>\n<h4>Opposed Tests</h4>\n<p>Sometimes you match your capabilities directly against those of an opponent. The rules represent this with a special Dramatic Test called an Opposed Test. Opposed Tests are an important part of <strong>WFRP&rsquo;s </strong>combat rules later in this chapter, but are used in many other situations, as well.</p>\n<p>An Opposed Test is handled just like any other Dramatic Test, but both parties make a Test. The party with the highest SL wins the Test. If both participants score the same SL, the party with the higher tested Skill or Characteristic wins. In the unlikely event there is still a tie, then one of two things, as determined by the GM, occurs: 1) there is a stalemate, and nothing happens; 2) both parties re-roll until there is a clear winner.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Having floored an important Reiklander baron at a party, Salundra makes to leave the ballroom; however, some uneasy guardsmen block her passage, knowing they really should detain the noble captain. Salundra scowls as she approaches.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>The GM calls for an Intimidate Test and opposes it with the guardsmen&rsquo;s commanding officer&rsquo;s Leadership Test. Both the player and the GM roll. Salundra&rsquo;s Intimidate is 47. The officer&rsquo;s Leadership is 46. Salundra rolls a 04, scoring +4 SL (4&ndash;0=4), while the GM rolls 16, scoring +3 SL (4&ndash;1=3). As Salundra&rsquo;s SL is higher (4 to the officer&rsquo;s 3), she successfully intimidates the guards, who let her pass with barely a grumble.</em></p>\n<p>Like any other Tests, some Opposed Tests are easier or harder than others, so the GM may decide modifiers are required. In most cases, these modifiers are applied equally to both sides, but not always. If no Difficulty is marked for an Opposed Test, it is assumed to be <strong>Challenging (+0).</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it is important to know how well the winner of the Opposed Test won, use the difference between the two results to determine a final SL.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:<em> It&rsquo;s Pie Week, an annual week-long festival for everyone&rsquo;s favourite baked goods, and Salundra has entered a pie-eating contest. She&rsquo;s reached the final, and it&rsquo;s her versus Fat Tom Brandysnap, the Ubersreik Pie Eating Champion for the last 5 years running, and a Halfling wider than he is tall.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>The GM calls for an Opposed Endurance Test. Salundra has an Endurance of 45 and Fat Tom has 63. Salundra is possibly in trouble! Dice roll, and Salundra rolls 51, scoring &ndash;1 SL. Sali&rsquo;s looking a little green! But Fat Tom&rsquo;s looking worse! He rolls 91 for &ndash;3 SL. So, even though she&rsquo;s failed her Endurance roll, she still wins the Opposed Test by 2 SL, though she&rsquo;ll probably be bringing up most of those pies later!</em></p>\n<h4>Extended Tests</h4>\n<p>Sometimes the adventure will call for a specific number of Success Levels be achieved to fully succeed at a time-consuming or especially taxing task. Doing this requires a special Dramatic Test called an Extended Test. Extended Tests are handled in the same fashion as any other Dramatic Test, but the SL scored from multiple rolls are added together to reach a specified target. If the total SL scored ever falls below 0, you can start again from scratch with the next roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong><em>: On the run again, Molli is attempting to pick an unexpectedly complex lock before she is discovered. The GM states the lock requires 5 Success Levels with a Challenging (+0) Pick Lock Test to pry open, and that she only has three Rounds before the guard arrives. Molli&rsquo;s Pick Lock skill is 58, so she has a good chance of managing it, but time isn&rsquo;t on her side. Unfortunately for her, her first Test scores 63: &ndash;1 SL and a terrible start, she&rsquo;s made no progress and will start from scratch next round.&nbsp; Cursing under her breath as footsteps draw closer, Molli tries again, this time scoring 11, for +4 SL! She feels tension in her picks as the lock almost springs, but she also hears the approaching guard is even closer.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>The GM explains the next Test is the last one before the guard arrives, so Molli can either abandon her attempt and avoid the guard or make a desperate effort to secure the last SL she needs&nbsp;to pick the lock. Knowing she needs to escape, Molli risks the last Test and rolls, scoring&hellip; 42! That&rsquo;s +1 SL, taking her to a total of 5. The lock opens with a click! Triumphant, Molli slips through the door and closes it behind her just before the guard arrives.</em></p>\n<h3>Assistance</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Assistance]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Combining Skills</em></h3>\n<p><em>Sometimes, you may be in a situation where you feel two Skills should be tested by the same character for a single task, so it may be appropriate to combine those Skills for a single Test. There are generally two reasons to do this: 1) is faster and limits the number of dice rolls required to press on with the game; 2) having to pass two Tests in a row to perform a single task significantly reduces your chance of passing overall.</em></p>\n<p><em>The simplest way to do this is to attempt both Skills with one Test, comparing a single percentile roll to each Skill number. If both pass, you succeed at the Test. If only one passes, you partially pass as appropriate. And, obviously, if both fail, you have failed the Test.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>After a string of unlikely events, Salundra finds herself on-stage in yellow and red tights, singing and dancing in the Vargr Breughel Memorial Playhouse&rsquo;s inaugural production of &lsquo;Tell Me On A Festag&rsquo;. The GM calls for a <strong>Challenging Combined Perform (Dance) and Entertain (Sing)</strong> Test, thinking it unfair Salundra should have to enact each Test in turn as that would significantly reduce her overall chance of success. Salundra has Perform (Dance) at 53 from her time in court, but doesn&rsquo;t have Entertain (Sing), so must use her Fellowship of 43. She then rolls 46, meaning she managed the dance (succeeded with +1 SL), but hit a few off-notes with her singing (failed at -0 SL) &mdash; not perfect, but good enough for the gathered crowds; though Kym Neumann, the Altdorf Spieler&rsquo;s theatre critic, may not be writing a favourable review...</p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"KBFMpqeeMFWhdpSI","sort":1100001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"}}}
{"_id":"j0YM1Bz8nObuMMVB","name":"Initial Inquiries: The Skaven","content":"<p>On the way to Middenheim, the Characters may have heard rumours about giant rats and rat-headed Beastmen in @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Middenheim’s Undercity}. After their encounters with Skaven in <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>, they are probably interested in finding out more. However, this will not be as easy as they might expect.</p>\n<p>To most people in the Old World, the Skaven are a myth. Although history records the Skaven Wars of 1,400 years ago, their activities since have been shrouded in secrecy. The Skaven take great care to destroy any evidence of their activities and kill any witnesses, lest their secret nests and tunnels beneath the Old World’s great cities should be discovered and a new series of wars ensue. Because of this, most in the Empire — especially in Middenheim, home of Count Mandred von Zelt, the legendary Ratslayer and greatest hero of the Skaven Wars — believe that the entire Skaven race was wiped out in the wars. Middenheimers  discount present-day sightings as the product of superstition and hysteria.</p>\n<p>Therefore, characters asking about Skaven are likely to encounter scorn and disbelief, and even to be fed ridiculous lines of nonsense by NPCs who want to amuse themselves at the expense of these credulous out-of-towners. Other NPCs may react angrily to such inquiries, their civic pride offended by any suggestion that the ratmen could have escaped detection and extermination.</p>\n<h3>Those Who Know</h3>\n<p>If the Characters ask the right questions in the right places, though, they may come across someone who knows that the Skaven still exist. Those who know  can tell them tales of hair-raising encounters. After the Characters hear enough such tales, a pattern starts to emerge — but by then, the events of the Carnival and the machinations of the Purple Hand require all their attention. Further investigation will have to wait until <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, in which the Characters will learn more about the dreaded ratmen than they ever wanted to know.</p>\n<h4>The Rat Catchers</h4>\n<p>If one wants to know about rats, of course, the best person to ask is a rat catcher. Middenheim’s rat catchers are licensed by the @JournalEntry[WI5fxShETkV7ungB]{Komission for Health, Education, and Welfare}, which is based in the @JournalEntry[ZWV1AbhVVbWfbEIz]{Neumarkt}-@JournalEntry[UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor} district. Anyone who goes there talking about Skaven is dismissed as a crackpot. A more cautious approach, for example, an enquiry about the @JournalEntry[I86oiOppQimWvWaP]{Rat Catchers' Guild} by a prospective member, leads the Characters to @JournalEntry[l8jWu9DzqX4QZ9ZZ]{the Regent's House} tavern off Schwanger Allee, where guild members meet in an upstairs room most evenings.</p>\n<p>The rat catchers are reluctant to speak of such matters to outsiders, but a few successful Fellowship Tests, helped along by a liberal quantity of ale, may establish trust enough to loosen a few tongues. The Characters may learn that rat-headed Beastmen are seen in the @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Undercity} now and again, although no one sober concedes that they are Skaven; they may also confirm the rumours of giant rats.</p>\n<h4>The Sewer Jacks</h4>\n<p>In the aftermath of the Skaven Wars Middenheim’s sewer jacks were established as a special arm of the City Watch  to patrol the Undercity and deal with any threats that might come up from below. Enquiries at any of the city gates lead the Characters to the Watch office on the @JournalEntry[asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials}. A Character with at least one warrior or rat catcher career can pose as a potential recruit, and be introduced to the leader of the sewer jacks, a tough-looking Halfling named Jacko Warble.</p>\n<p>Again, some <strong>Fellowship </strong>Tests are needed to establish a level of trust where the Characters can ask about Skaven without being laughed out of the building. But a sewer jack may confirm that Skaven — or creatures very like Skaven — have been encountered in the @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Undercity}, though the sewer jacks have been unable to discover how they get in and out, as they are fond of collapsing tunnels behind them to prevent pursuit.</p>\n<h4>The Dwarfs</h4>\n<p>The city’s Dwarven community knows the @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Undercity} better than almost any other group. Dwarf @JournalEntry[Ironbreakers] — specialists in underground warfare — often accompany sewer jack patrols. Enquiries at the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission for Elven, Dwarven, and Halfling} Interests may put the Characters in touch with local Dwarf leaders, and Dwarfs who ask at the @JournalEntry[A6D8GCA2S0g8vw8K]{Dwarven Engineers’ Guild}, the @JournalEntry[7wu8onhV4JEAuEfn]{Temple of Grungni}, or anywhere else associated with the Dwarven community will be directed to Modi Zargul at the Axe and Barrel Tavern in @JournalEntry[KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{the Wynd}. The place caters to a Dwarven clientele: its ceilings are 5’ 6”” high, counting as an enclosed space for Humans and Elves; all non-Dwarfs suffer a –10 penalty to <strong>Fellowship</strong> Tests; and there is a 75% chance that any Dwarf NPC encountered here has @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.0VpT5yubw4UL7j6f]{Animosity} toward Elves.</p>\n<p>Modi is one of several Ironbreakers in Middenheim, and admits to a fellow Dwarf that he sometimes leads unofficial patrols through the @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Undercity} on the orders of the Dwarf elders. He and his Ironbreakers have encountered Skaven, and are in no doubt that the creatures do exist: ‘but if the Manlings like to think otherwise, that’s their business. We just kill them when we find them.’</p>\n<h3>The Skaven Plot</h3>\n<p>The Skaven-worshipping Yellow Fang cult is well established in Middenheim. They have infiltrated organisations such as the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, the @JournalEntry[I86oiOppQimWvWaP]{Rat Catchers' Guild}, the Sewer Jacks, and various Komissions. The Yellow Fang monitors the organisations it infiltrates for news of any threat to its masters in the Under-Empire. The cult generates a constant stream of misleading rumour to help obscure Skaven activities.</p>\n<p>The Skaven themselves are not unusually active in the city at present, with the exception of the group that kidnapped Reya, @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich’s} niece (see @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{Chaos Strikes By Night}) Success here helps the Characters free Ehrlich from Wasmeier’s control, and set the adventure’s finale in motion.</p>\n<p>However, the Skaven are not a major part of this adventure, and the players should realise quite quickly that there are other things afoot. If the players become obsessed with the Skaven, you may indulge them if you wish. However, be sure to have NPCs remind them that events involving the Carnival, the taxes, and growing sectarian discontent continue to build quite apart from what any large rats in the sewers may be plotting.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>IN THE SHADOW OF THE HORNED RAT</em></h3>\n<p><em>While the role of the Skaven is limited in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, the species of devious rat-creatures that plagues the Empire, often quite literally, will feature heavily in The Horned Rat, part four of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>. If you intend to run that adventure in the future then NPCs informed of Skaven activities, especially @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann}, may give the Characters' tales of humanoid rats some consideration. They will also make it clear, however, that any serious investigation will have to wait until after the Carnival has concluded.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-sewers.webp\" width=\"584\" height=\"860\" /></p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-sewers.webp","folder":"Evbhh3cOQ21VdDSM","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 4: Initial Inquiries","sort":500000}}}

{"_id":"j1pFLzKRxekSkLtX","name":"Craftsmanship","content":"<p>The items available in the shops, stalls, and merchant halls of the Empire vary significantly in quality. Not everything is made equal, and the Craftsmanship rules reflect this using Item Qualities, and Item Flaws.</p>\n<p>An Item Quality makes the trapping a little better, but harder to find. An Item Flaw makes the trapping a little worse, but easier to find.</p>\n<h3>Item Qualities</h3>\n<p>A Trapping is called a Quality Trapping if it has more Item Qualities than Flaws. For each Item Quality the Trapping has, double its price and make it one step less available. A Trapping with more Qualities than its Encumbrance, and that lacks any Flaws, is called a Best Quality Trapping.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>A spade that has the Fine and Durable Item Qualities costs quadruple the list price, and drops availability from Common to Rare.</em></p>\n<h4>Durable</h4>\n<p>Laboriously crafted using strong materials, the item can take +Durable Damage points before it suffers any negatives (see @JournalEntry[ru9YEZPK1fEoiXMO]{Weapon Damage} and @JournalEntry[10LxsWBSwEmjZWeV]{Armour Damage}) and gains a saving throw of 9+ on a 1d10 roll against instant breakage from sources like Trap Blade (see @JournalEntry[ru9YEZPK1fEoiXMO]{Weapons}). This Quality can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the saving throw improves by 1 (e.g. From 9+ to 8+).</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Molli owns a high quality sword with Durable 3, meaning it can take 3 Damage before suffering any negatives, and has a saving throw of 7+ against breaking. </em></p>\n<h4>Fine</h4>\n<p>Meticulously crafted to please the eye. This Quality is a sign of social status and can be taken multiple times. The higher the quality, the more impressive it seems.</p>\n<h4>Lightweight</h4>\n<p>Cleverly crafted for ease of carrying. Reduce Encumbrance points by 1.</p>\n<h4>Practical</h4>\n<p>Expertly crafted with utility in mind. A failed test using this item receives +1 SL. If the item is a piece of armour, any penalties for wearing it are reduced by one level (for example from −30 to −20).</p>\n<h3>Item Flaws</h3>\n<p>A Trapping is called a Flawed Trapping if it has more Item Flaws than Qualities. Each Flaw halves the listed price and improves Availability by one step. Many vendors sell flawed items, but pretend they are anything but. A successful Test with any appropriate skill — such as Evaluate, or Melee for weapons, or Trade for tools — will spot such underhanded activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Exotic items do not have their Availability modified by being Flawed — they are always difficult to find, even shoddy examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>A suit of chainmail that is both Bulky and Unreliable costs a quarter of the list price, and raises Availability from Rare to Common.</em></p>\n<h4>Ugly</h4>\n<p>Crafted without any aesthetic awareness whatsoever, Ugly items attract negative attention, and related Fellowship Tests might even suffer a –10 penalty.</p>\n<h4>Shoddy</h4>\n<p>Hastily crafted by an amateur or fraudster. The item breaks when used in any failed Test rolling a double. Similarly, Shoddy armour breaks if any Critical Hit is sustained to a Hit Location it protects.</p>\n<h4>Unreliable</h4>\n<p>Crafted without attention to functionality, a failed test using this item receives –1 SL. Further, penalties for wearing Unreliable armour are doubled.</p>\n<h4>Bulky</h4>\n<p>An awkward design crafted clumsily. Increase Encumbrance by +1 (small trinkets cannot normally have this flaw).

Further, for each Creature Trait a new breed has, or step increase with the <em>Size</em> Trait (e.g.: from Small to Medium), the costs increase by another 10/&ndash;. Lastly, for each Decrease (which I'll count as each &ndash;5 in an Attribute or &ndash;1 Move), the cost for the breed decreases by 1/&ndash;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Change</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cost</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Each Advance</td>\n<td>+1/&ndash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Each new Trait or Size increase</td>\n<td>+10/&ndash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Each Decrease</td>\n<td>&ndash;1/&ndash;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, let's apply that to the Telland. It has 11 Advances, 1 Decrease, and 2 Traits when compared to the Pit Dog. That equates to +11/&ndash;, &ndash;1/&ndash;, +20/&ndash;. So, and extra +20/&ndash; on top of the base 2GC for a Pit Hound. So the Telland has a base cost of 3GC 10/&ndash;.<br /><br />Nice. What about the Ulzhammer?<br /><br />Well, it has 16 Advances, 3 Decreases, and 3 new Traits, so +16/&ndash;, &ndash;3/&ndash;, +30/&ndash;. Adding that to the base cost of 2 GC for a Herding Dog, we get base cost of 4GC 3/&ndash;.<br /><br />That... works well enough for me. I don't feel I need rules to create the different breeds (I'll simply make them up as needed later in this post), but some rules for costing them will be handy. And the ones above do nicely.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if I'm sorting prices for buying and selling doggos, I should also consider Item Qualities, especially if I'm considering creating special breeds like the Telland or Ulzhammer. After all, pure-bred animals always cost more, which sounds like the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to me.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />However, the normal Item Qualities rules don't really apply as Dogs are living creatures, so I'm going to limit it to just the one I need. So I'll just use the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to represent a pedigree.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />So, the more&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Qualities purchased, the stronger the bloodline of the animal, and the more impressive it appears. This brings no advantages beyond bragging rights and high returns if the animal is ever sold. So, if a Player wants to buy any special breed beyond the generic versions presented at the beginning of this post, at least 1 instance of&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;should have to be bought to show it's a purebred animal accessing the special rules. I'll not make that a firm rule, as I may wish to keep costs low at some points; it's more of a guideline that I'll almost always follow.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />That would mean a typical Telland actually starts at 7GC (the base cost of 3GC 10/&ndash; is doubled because of the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality). Obviously, Mongrels cannot purchase the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to represent breeding, but it could be purchased to show a dog with a particularly pretty face or similar.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />That'll do.<br /><br />Equally, I'll dump the Item Flaws outside&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em>. Taking the&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em>&nbsp;Flaw for your pet shows it's particularly ill-favoured in appearance, which may come with penalties in some situations.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />Normally, both&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;can't be applied to a single doggo, but I'm sure there are examples of ugly versions of purebred animals, so I'll not make that a hard rule, and leave it to individual circumstances to dictate.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />So, let's put all of that into action with a variety of new breeds for each of the Dog types, alongside their prices. I'll use the formula I quickly pulled from nowhere for most of the coin costs here, but a few breeds will break this as they are especially rare.</p>"}

He opens the door to the office and as he does so the sound of raised voices can be heard, coming from both the foyer outside and the holding cells beneath the building. Captain Trenker shuffles some papers before him before launching into his brief.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Morning, well, we all know that the big news at the moment is of this Pattern Killer that&rsquo;s doing the rounds, every Mondstille seems to bring another of these sick whoresons out of the woodwork, must be the cold. This one has a taste for halflings, we&rsquo;ve found three victims so far, two Angestag the week before last, and the first one Angestag two weeks before that. This means we&rsquo;re well due another if he&rsquo;s to keep the pattern up, so keep your eye out. These killings have brought us a lot of publicity, you know how the little people like to kick up a fuss, so watch out for reporters for the Altdorf Speiler. Also keep a look out for a Halfling named Heiro Juniper. He&rsquo;s some Mootland loudmouth who thinks he&rsquo;s looking after the interests of Altdorf&rsquo;s Halflings by wasting Watch time. If he bothers you during your patrol just tell him to come and see me.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The last victim, as I&rsquo;m sure you know, was one Hugo Shortshank, who has been giving us a merry old run-around these last few months. The killer poisoned him with his own Wierdroot supply.</p>\n<p>Can&rsquo;t say that the little runt didn&rsquo;t deserve it, frankly. We&rsquo;ve received a tip-off that the halfling used to visit the Mermaid Tavern a great deal, but he wasn&rsquo;t known as a drinker, so maybe that&rsquo;s where he bought his supply. It usually opens about midday, so swing by there on your rounds and make a few enquiries.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Some joker&rsquo;s been pasting up posters trying to get everyone panicked about Ratmen living in Altdorf&rsquo;s sewer system. It&rsquo;s probably just a student prank, but keep your eye out for him and if you spot him bring him in. And find out where he's getting his posters.</p>\n<p>\"Someone set fire to a barge down by three-toll bridge last night. Raimun Sager got kneecapped by a dwarf apparently. I'd say it was gang-related, but Adolf and his cronies over in the bridge station swore they saw some horrible bats or something flying around it when they went to investigate. I really don't want the witch hunters down here breathing down our necks, we've got enough on our plates already, so if you could make a few subtle inquiries - maybe find out what was on it, who loaded it and such. Maybe we can have something to hand over if they come sniffing round. The barge was the Miss Bedenklich</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And make sure you swing by the warehouses near the Hook Wharfs this morning, one of their members is claiming that they&rsquo;ve seen a goblin running around in there. Could just be wasting our time or suffering from some weirdroot vision, but take a look anyway &ndash; they&rsquo;d be stupid to joke about this seeing as it might well affect the confidence of their customers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Other than that it&rsquo;s more of the usual I&rsquo;m afraid, drunks, thieves, harlots and gang fights. Any questions?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be careful out there, lads.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Trenker gathers some effects. If no one has any questions for him he leaves and goes down to the cells to see what all the fuss is about. Mention again that as the door to the office opens a number of different raised voices can be heard.</p>\n<p>Trenker then becomes embroiled in @JournalEntry[ekuOD5t7AJvJvdvJ]{The Case of the Arrested Noble}.</p>\n<h2>THE FOYER</h2>\n<p>As soon as the patrol exit the office they enter the foyer. From a stairwell leading down to the cells they can hear a cultured Wissenlander voice demanding <em>&ldquo;How dare you keep me incarcerated here, don&rsquo;t you know who I am? I&rsquo;ll have you thrashed man! Thrashed!&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>At the desk are a group of three men, who are all tired and unshaven looking. They have suntanned faces and curly black greasy hair. They are debating loudly in a language none of the group can understand. The desk staff, Inga Schultz (an ex-thief) and Eric Dangon (an ex-roadwarden) also seem confused. The foreigners are getting louder and more exasperated.</p>\n<p>A PC moving towards the cells will catch Inga&rsquo;s attention. <em>&ldquo;Leave it be!&rdquo;</em> She&rsquo;ll call out, <em>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s just some lout who&rsquo;s getting gobby, the Captain&rsquo;s dealing with &lsquo;im, best leave &lsquo;im to it, eh?&rdquo;</em> Anyone can identify the language being spoken by the men as Tilean on a successful<strong> Average (+20) Intelligence</strong> Test. If no one gets it make sure they use some stock phrases, <em>&ldquo;Mama Mia!&rdquo; </em>and the like. If Eric is asked if he recognises the language, but cannot understand or speak it.</p>\n<p>Engaging with the Tileans via mime might work, and be a break from describing the game for the GM and players. The Tileans will try to mime the following info:</p>\n<p>&bull; Ugly face. Bandy legged gait. Sneer. Where?</p>\n<p>The Tileans are here to deliver a bunch of specimens to the University of Altdorf, and a goblin has been stolen from their boat.</p>\n<p>The PCs will make no more headway without an interpreter, however. If or when they have one, or if they are really great mime artists, they can look into @JournalEntry[5zopWtNNkCYdQ0ow]{The Case of the Upset Tileans}.</p>\n<p>The PCs could talk to Eric and Inga. Eric is somewhat tight-lipped and seems very angry about something. Inga is a good source of gossip (tests with her are <strong>Easy (+40)</strong>) and can be pumped for some local rumours, though she will not say much more than what&rsquo;s in the Speiler or opinions of local bad lads.</p>\n<p>Asked about the prisoner downstairs she says: <em>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s some southern fug wot Sergeant Troltz&rsquo;s patrol picked up last night. Beatin&rsquo; the daylights out of some &lsquo;arlot &lsquo;e was &ndash; made a right mess of &lsquo;er. &lsquo;E claims &lsquo;e&rsquo;s some sort of hoity-toity to do type &lsquo;e does, but &lsquo;e&rsquo;s just tryin&rsquo; to avoid trouble if y&rsquo;arsk me. Captain&rsquo;ll sort &lsquo;im aht, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<h2>THE BEATEN BAWD</h2>\n<p>Then just as the PCs decide to leave the foyer a man stumbles through it, covered in blood. They recognise him instantly as Tristan Mahler, a local bawd who also has a history of smuggling. Inga rushes over to tend to his wounds. The PCs can ignore him if they wish, or they can try to help him recover and talk to him, in which case go to @JournalEntry[ZbDsbmx9A22WB2ST]{The Case of the Beaten Bawd}.</p>\n<h2>OUTSIDE THE STATION</h2>\n<p>It is mid-morning and music week is already getting underway, all along the Luitpoldstrasse and the Street of 100 Taverns different musicians are playing a variety of instruments with wildly varying degrees of skill and success. Just outside the station a fiddler will be scratching his way through a very poor rendition of &ldquo;Drakwald Lament&rdquo;, a group of people gather round pelting him with rotten vegetables, but he carries on gamefully.</p>\n<p>A little way up from a bodrhan player inexpertly bangs his drum. The second time the Watch pass him he is banging the rim with his stick, as someone has punctured the skin of his drum. The third time they pass him he lies in the gutter unconscious, the tattered remains of his drum around his neck. The fourth time they pass nothing is there but a pool of blood. The next time they pass a dulcian player stands in his place, parping his way through &ldquo;The Lazy Sonne&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>All sorts try to make an impression during music week. A trio with mandolin, cittern and lute play beautiful music, casting evil looks at a nearby hurdy-gurdy player, whose caterwauling drowns them out somewhat. At one point the PCs may even see a noble wheel a large and beautifully decorated harpsichord balanced on a flat-bed cart out into the street - his bodyguards make sure that his audience keep their distance whilst he deftly plays a number of Bretonnian laments.</p>"}

You should be familiar with these before play. The pawns are not Purple Hand cultists, but expendable hirelings paid by the Law Lord to do his dirty work.

If he decides to have them silenced, the GM must determine whether, when, and how the NPCs will strike.

If @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} has to contact the Law Lord in an emergency, she adopts a disguise and visits him at home, using her Stealth Skill to avoid being followed.</p>\n<p>@Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} has been very busy, and the party may have come across some or all of her activities. As ‘Charlotte,’ she hypnotised the @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Graf ’s Champion} into supporting the tax changes. As ‘Elise Kaltblutig,’ she stole the love-letters from @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} to the @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Graf ’s paramour}, and then used blackmail to gain his support for the taxes. Finally, as ‘Frau Kenner,’ she continues to supply @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald's Delight} to the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, to keep him loyal, so that the tax changes are maintained. This last role is very important, since she contacts the Chancellor on a regular basis, giving the party a chance to encounter her, and track her to the lair.</p>\n<h3>‘Frau Kenner’</h3>\n<p>@Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} visits the Inner Palace in this disguise once a week on Festag night to make a delivery to @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Sparsam}. He has given her a pass permitting entrance to the ground floor; it was with this pass that she was able to gain access via the gardens to the apartments of the Ladies-at-Court and steal the love-letters.</p>\n<p>Josef Gropius, a Palace man-at-arms, was attracted to Frau Kenner and, in a romantic move, followed her home one night some four weeks ago. He tracked her to the @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}. At this point he almost gave up, but out of curiosity he continued until he saw her enter an inn called ‘the Pit.’ He thought this strange, but concluded that the woman must be working undercover for someone important in the Palace. He then decided to leave her alone. Like all Palace staff, Josef is reliable. He  only reveals this information if asked by someone with authority, such as any of the major NPCs.</p>\n<p>It is very important to the pace of the adventure that the Characters are able to follow Frau Kenner after her visit to @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Sparsam} on Festag night. She will lead the party to the lair, and from this point on events lead to a thrilling climax. The party can achieve this in various ways, depending on how they have come to hear about ‘Frau Kenner.’ These are detailed in the following paragraphs.</p>\n<p>It is impossible for one person to trail someone through the huge crowds in the city on the last night of Carnival. The more Characters take part, the better the chance of success, and the street urchins could also be helpful. The crowds thin out as the @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} is reached, but even here the streets hold a sizeable number of drunken revellers.</p>\n<p>If the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} is the key, then all the Characters have to do is wait for her next delivery on the last night of the Carnival, at about 9.00pm. Sparsam is attending the opera that night, but will pop back to the Palace during the interval.</p>\n<p>If they have talked to Josef Gropius, the party will be aware of a place called ‘the Pit’ — or they may already have been there and bought information on ‘Frau Kenner’ from @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl}. They may simply stake the place out, in which case they will see ‘Frau Kenner’ arrive at about 8.30pm. She can then be trailed to the Inner Palace and, after supplying Sparsam, back to her lair. She will have a few drinks in various inns before she returns, arriving back at about 11.30pm.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are having difficulty tracing ‘Frau Kenner,’ one of the NPCs mentioned in @JournalEntry[mNMoXXZJKYGjXH7O]{‘The Harmacist’} may approach them with information about her base. A ‘gratitude payment’ of anything up to @Pay[2gc]{2 GCs} seems reasonable for such a service. Again, the pace of the adventure will benefit if this information is obtained on the last night of the Carnival.</p>\n<p>One final possibility is for the party to try and locate the lady in question by recruitment, perhaps hinting gently to dubious characters that they are looking for a woman with good disguise skills to pull off some confidence trick or other. The Characters might get into some rather unpleasant company in this way, but Brunhilde may hear of them and rise to the bait: although she works for @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, this does not stop her undertaking other commissions. She will be very wary, though and try to arrange a meeting somewhere where she is totally confident, and can escape if the need arises.</p>","folder":"8RbZHSArNQNSMvQ7","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 7: The Traitor Unmasked","sort":100000}}}

{"_id":"jum6OILnormKdlgu","name":"Corruption","content":"<p>Every Festag, Sigmarite priests preach from high pulpits about the dangers of the Ruinous Powers, about how good folk must avoid the temptations of daemons whispering from every shadow. They declare all souls are in perpetual peril, mere footsteps from falling to corruption and mutation. And they might be right.</p>\n<p>Corruption points are used to show the slow, gradual slip of your soul to the Dark Gods of Chaos. Whenever you are exposed to a potential source of corruption, you may accrue Corruption points. The more you have, the closer you are drawing to Chaos, and the darker your soul becomes until, eventually, you change…</p>\n<h3 xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Gaining Corruption Points</h3>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\">During play, there are two primary routes to gaining corruption: dark deals and corrupting influences .</p>\n<h4 role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\">Dark Deals</h4>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\">Sometimes, you just have to succeed. Most commonly this means passing an important Test. Should such a Test fail, you can use a Fortune point to reroll the Test, hopefully passing the second time. But what if it fails again? Or you have no Fortune points remaining? Then it’s time for a dark deal.</p>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\">You can purposefully choose to take a Corruption point to reroll a Test, even if it has been rerolled already. This is always a choice for you, not the GM — although there is nothing wrong with the GM gently reminding you that you could try again. After all, what’s the worst that could happen?</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Options: Encroaching Darkness...</span></h3>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\"><em>Some inventive players prefer to embellish their dark deals with disturbing events happening in-game. If you like the sound of this, it’s up to you how such events should manifest, but tailoring them to the story of the character involved is always a good idea. Perhaps taint subtly influences the local area causing animals to flee or plants to gently rot?&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\"><em>Perhaps you could roll on the @Table[minormis]{Miscast table} to create a random event (especially appropriate for wizards and witches)? Think of the Test tied to the dark deed, and then consider soul-staining events that could occur to ensure your success.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\">Corrupting Influences</h4>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\">Corruption points are usually gained by exposure to a place, person, or object tainted by Chaos, or to a situation especially beloved to one of the Dark Gods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\">If you encounter a corrupting influence, attempt a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test, or Challenging (+0) Cool Test, as determined by the GM — usually physical influences are resisted with Endurance, spiritual corruption is resisted with Cool.&nbsp;</p>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\">The stronger the corrupting influence, the more SL you will need to avoid it. The following provides some examples of corrupting influences with the number of SL needed to completely avoid Corruption points.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\"><strong>Foundry Note</strong>: Click on the links below to prompt players to resist Corruption, or use the `/corruption` chat command. e.g. /corruption moderate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>@Corruption[minor]{Minor Exposure}</strong></p>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\">These corrupting influences, although relatively trivial, still endanger a weak soul. If a Test is failed to resist such a minor exposure, gain 1 Corruption point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">The stronger the corrupting influence, the more SL needed to avoid. The following are examples:</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Witness a Lesser Daemon</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Contact with a Mutant, refined Warpstone, or Chaos-tainted artefact</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Giving in to despair, rage, excess, or the need to change your lot. </span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Being near Warpstone</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Prolonged exposure to Chaos worshippers, Chaos Cult Temples, Mutant Lairs, and Similar</span>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\">@Corruption[moderate]{Moderate Exposure}</span></strong></p>\n<p xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Moderate corrupting influences are a danger to every soul and should be avoided under all circumstances.

On a Success (2–3), you gain 1 Corruption point. Only if you score an Impressive Success (4+), do you gain no Corruption points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Witness a Greater Daemon</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Prolonged contact with a Daemon, Warpstone, or profane artefact. </span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Making a deal with a Daemon</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Consuming refined Warpstone</span>&nbsp;</li>\n<li xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Prolonged exposure to an environment steeped with <span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">dhar&nbsp;</span></span>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3 role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\">Corrupting</span></h3>\n<p xml:lang=\"EN-US\">No-one is left unscathed by exposure to the Ruinous Powers. Eventually, even the strongest fall, their mind and bodies twisting into new unrecognisable forms.</p>\n<p xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Should you ever gain more Corruption points than your Willpower Bonus plus your Toughness Bonus, immediately attempt a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test. If passed, you have managed to hold off your corruption for now but will have to Test again next time you gain Corruption Points. If you fail, then either your body or mind is about to mutate.</p>\n<p xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">&nbsp;</span><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\">Dissolution of Body and Mind</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p xml:lang=\"EN-US\">As corruption ravages your soul, the warping breath of Chaos whispers within, either fanning your flesh into a fresh, new form, or fracturing your psyche with exquisite knowledge it can never unlearn.</p>\n<p xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">&nbsp;</span>First, lose Corruption points equal to your Willpower Bonus as you mutate. Next, roll percentile dice and refer to the following table to determine whether it’s your body or your mind that blossoms anew.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Elf</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Halfling</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Human</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Dwarf</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Body</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">-</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>01-10</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">01-50</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">01-05</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Mind</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">01-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">11-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">51-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">06-10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now roll on either the @Table[mutatephys]{Physical Corruption} Table or the @Table[mutatemental]{Mental Corruption Table} to see what happens.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong>If you have&nbsp;<strong>Enemy In Shadows&nbsp;</strong>installed, you can also use @Table[expandedmutatephys]{Expanded Physical} or @Table[expandedmutatemental]{Expanded Mental Mutations}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Corruption Limits</h4>\n<p>A soul can only withstand so much corruption before it collapses upon itself, leaving a mutated, gibbering mess. Should you survive long enough to gain more mutations than your Toughness Bonus, or more mental corruptions than your Willpower Bonus, you have fallen to Chaos, your soul completely lost to the uncaring Chaos Gods. At this point, it’s time to create a new character. Your current one is now damned, becoming an NPC controlled by the GM, meaning you may well see the wretched creature again…</p>\n<h3>Losing Corruption Points</h3>\n<p>Once the claws of the Dark Gods have sunk into your soul, removing their vile stain is difficult, but not impossible. Beyond the less-than-desirable option of losing Corruption points by gaining mutations, there are two other methods of losing Corruption points: dark whispers and absolution .</p>\n<h4>Dark Whispers</h4>\n<p>Even considering the inscrutable plans of the Dark Gods is enough to break a pious man’s sanity, so trying to fathom their intent, and why they reach out to twist one mortal soul or another, is not just foolish, it’s extraordinarily dangerous. But reach out they do.</p>\n<p>The GM may ask to spend one of your Corruption points to use the darkness building in your soul to twist your actions. The choice to do this or not is always in your hands, but if you agree, you lose 1 Corruption Point. Examples of what may be asked include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Letting an enemy escape.</li>\n<li>‘Accidentally’ shooting an ally.</li>\n<li>Falling asleep on watch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Of course, if you deny the GM and choose to do none of those potentially terrible things, you keep your Corruption point, but the Ruinous Powers still hold a portion of your soul.</p>\n<h4>Absolution</h4>\n<p>As Corruption points build, and you feel the oppressive fist of the Dark Gods curling around your beleaguered soul, your dread may lead you to seek absolution. But simply asking forgiveness from a local preacher won’t be enough. The stain of the Dark Gods’ touch isn’t so easily scrubbed clean. The exact limits of what is required to remove Corruption is left in the hands of the GM, but it is rarely, if ever, simple.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Printed adventures may include situations where Corruption can be removed, but if you wish to seek your own route to absolution, consider the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cleanse a profane temple to the Dark Gods. Though the very act may expose you to more corruption…</li>\n<li>Complete a holy pilgrimage and receive a blessing from a high priest at the end of the long, dangerous journey.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Destroy an unholy artefact, or otherwise render it safe, foiling the schemes of the Dark Gods.</li>\n<li>Join a holy order and dedicate your life to one of the Gods opposed to Chaos.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Slow Manifestations</em></h3>\n<p><em>Manifesting a mutation of the body or mind can come quickly, but normally it’s a slow process, perhaps starting as an itch, patch of flaky skin, or a new tic, and only later developing into a new eye, unexpected feathers, or an entirely new mindset. If you would prefer to draw the mutation process out, perhaps to play upon the horror of the inevitable mutations to come, you are encouraged to do so. This is left in the hands of the GM to detail according to individual taste and preference.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"KBFMpqeeMFWhdpSI","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"}}}

Life here may be harsh, but a handful of villages and hamlets, and one fortified town: Grunw&auml;cht, can be found in fortified positions or deep in the valleys. It is not a particularly wealthy province, its main source of income being goat-herding, largely from exports of goat&rsquo;s milk and cheese to Ubersreik. <br />Desperate prospectors are a common sight, each convinced there must be hidden seams of ore similar to those found in Black Rock, Lady&rsquo;s Vale, or Grauwerk. But if any have struck a motherlode that could turn Widow&rsquo;s Vale&rsquo;s fortunes around, they have yet to share their success.<br />The former rulers of the Vale, the Saals, were wiped out decades ago when Greenskins razed their castle. The current ruler, Count Palatine Gregor Schadelfaust, bears the grandiose title &lsquo;Defender of Widow&rsquo;s Vale&rsquo;. Schadelfaust is the illegitimate son of Graf Sigismund von Jungfreud&rsquo;s late older brother, Tywald. His military career culminated recently when he relieved the besieged town of Grunw&auml;cht. Emperor Karl-Franz was so impressed with his valour that he elevated him to the nobility, granting him a title and Hohewacht Tower from which to rule. This was a source of some irritation for Schadelfaust&rsquo;s uncle, Graf von Jungfreud, and Archduke von Walfen. Graf von Jungfreud is not happy with his illegitimate nephew&rsquo;s rise to nobility, and sees him as a threat to his family line. Archduke von Walfen was the commander who ordered Schadelfaust to Grunw&auml;cht, and he is not pleased with Schadelfaust&rsquo;s increase in power and status.</p>\n<h3>Grunwacht</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;What used to be the primary population centre of the Lady&rsquo;s Vale &mdash; with almost 700 souls &mdash; is now a severely depressed community of little more than 200. The town has been built upon countless ruined settlements that have suffered Greenskins raids, just like the one that shocked it recently. The town is far from the eyes of Ubersreik, and only marginally protected by their local ruler, Count-Palatine Gregor Schadelfaust, in H&ouml;hewacht Tower. The only reason folks remain in Grunw&auml;cht is to pan for &lsquo;green gold&rsquo;, also known as electrum, in the seemingly inexhaustible Gl&auml;nzend River that flows down to Messingen. Grunw&auml;cht is 33 miles from Ubersreik.</p>\n<h3>Traisburg</h3>\n<p>A minor crossroads, with a farming hamlet of almost a hundred people. However, it&rsquo;s population has been swollen by almost three times that size, given the two encamped opposing forces that surround it &mdash; on one<br />side Jungfreuds, and on the other, Altdorfers (who have managed to seize the village green). The two armies have yet to come to serious blows, with standing orders just to hold position, but their tussles and hungry mouths are making them fierce enemies among the locals. Traisburg sports a tavern that doubles as an inn, recently renamed the Camp Follower, where the leaders of both armies rent private rooms. The Characters can rent a room here for 10 shillings, though their sleep may be interrupted by brawling soldiers. Traisburg is 17 miles from Ubersreik.<span style=\"font-family: ACaslonPro-Bold; font-size: 9pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: ACaslonPro-Regular; font-size: 9pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><br style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /></span></span></span></span></p>\n<h3>Bamenz</h3>\n<p>A tiny hamlet of just under 40 souls, built on top of a bluff in the Grey Mountains, and accessible only by dangling ropes. The locals proudly proclaim the bluff is &lsquo;Reikland&rsquo;s very own Fauschlag Rock&rsquo; in the most pathetic attempt at imitating Middenheim. Still, the folk here are hardy, and cling far closer to the old worship of Ulric rather than Sigmar. Bamenz is 29 miles from Ubersreik.</p>\n<h3>Elssen</h3>\n<p>Elssen is a hamlet &mdash; in Reikland this means it&rsquo;s a community so small it lacks a Sigmarite temple &mdash; of less than a hundred souls who scrape together a living from net fishing on the banks of the Teufel, and by herding goats for their milk to make cheese in the fertile valley where it sits.<br />The hamlet, like everywhere else in these parts, has seen better days, and recent raids by Greenskins have decimated the population. Most of the citizens walk around with symbols of mourning, and the population has a gloomy disposition.</p>\n<p>Cresting the last hill, you come to a meeting point of two tributaries of the Teufel: the Fest, cramped in a valley to the south, and the Taumeln, which tumbles from nearby falls. On the far bank of the confluence rests a tiny hamlet tucked into and around the crags of the climbing foothills. Above and behind the hamlet, about 3 miles away, rises the thin needle point of the Tower of Vane as the mountainside rapidly rises into the sky.</p>\n<p>As you begin the journey down to the hamlet, the folk on your side begin to scramble and arm themselves, only to relax slightly once they get a better look at you.</p>\n<p>A young riverwoman &mdash; Hedwig Sch&ouml;ner &mdash; lives on this side of the river, and transports the Characters across if they trade her anything of Common availability or rarer.<br />She does not accept anything that would require her to be able to read, as she can&rsquo;t. She won&rsquo;t accept money, either, and advises that few folks in Elssen will, if they&rsquo;re expecting to be here for long. Sch&ouml;ner, curiously, can&rsquo;t be intimidated into granting transport &mdash; she is utterly fearless &mdash; and expresses in a tired voice<em> &lsquo;If the Greenskins haven&rsquo;t chased me off yet, what makes you think you&rsquo;ll scare me, eh? Cut me down for all I care &mdash; Father Morr&rsquo;ll surely have a nice spot waiting for me, and his wife will be the judge o&rsquo; you.&rsquo;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<h3>The Tower of Vane</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Despite being able to see parts of the Tower of Vane rising above the mountains for much of the last day, it is only now that you truly can see its splendour. A great needle the colour of unpolished iron &mdash; practically featureless, save for a glittering glass dome at its tip &mdash; rises out from a sunken valley filled with a glacier. The tower appears to be, at first, built upon the ice, but it evidently stretches down deep into its cold embrace.</p>\n<p>By the sway and curve of the surrounding mountains, you can tell that the lake would only see sunlight at the height of noon, regardless of the season. The lake has likely been frozen forever, which beggars the mind to comprehend how it was built&hellip;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tower of Vane is at least 1,000 feet tall, has many windows cut into its spiralling form, and sports a single door at its base.</p>\n<p>Clustered around the base, and towards the back of the building, are wooden structures of a much simpler and obviously human make, which are undoubtedly the living quarters, kitchens, and other amenities that support the tower. Peering into the ice, and on a successful <strong>Difficult (&minus;10) Perception</strong> Test, the Characters can see that the tower extends deep into the ice, perhaps as far down as it goes up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nothing stirs in this forsaken valley &mdash; no birds chirp, no voices sound. Even the wind seems afraid to break the silence. Stepping out on to the glacier, whilst at first a terrifying prospect, becomes not so frightening once you notice small shards of stone and sand frozen into the top to make a coarse walkway across the ice.</p>\n<p>Only as you approach them do you realise the truth &mdash; the doors, and the tower itself, are entirely made of lead.</p>\n</blockquote>"}
{"_id":"k22khmtcZMFViVqo","name":"Introduction (Power Behind the Throne)","content":"<p>Welcome to Power Behind the Throne, the third volume in the Director’s Cut edition of the Enemy Within campaign. While it can be played on its own, it has been designed to be played after completing @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.gnr5Hw8IJgA62V3R]{Death on the Reik}, volume 2 of the campaign. This book contains everything you need to play the adventure (except for the WFRP 4th edition rulebook), but the GM may find it useful to have a copy of @JournalEntry[tkm0lbhbghjMSXRA]{Middenheim: City of the White Wolf} as well: that book contains additional details on the city of Middenheim, including many useful locations and NPCs.</p>\n<h2>The Story</h2>\n<p>Following leads from their previous adventures, the Characters travel to the great fortress-city of @JournalEntry[Middenheim]. Along the way, they hear of trouble brewing in the city. On arrival they find that, behind the boisterous cheer of Middenheim’s famed @JournalEntry[YPpM7Pg44EgT2yt5]{Carnival}, sinister forces are at work. A raft of new taxes has alienated several groups that have always been crucial to the city’s defence; tensions between the Imperial cult of Sigmar and the local faith of Ulric regularly boil over into violence; and at least two Chaos cults are gnawing away at the city’s social and political fabric.</p>\n<p>The city’s ruler, the Elector Count @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris Todbringer}, does nothing, apparently in the midst of a deep depression following the death of his wife. The city’s movers and shakers, from the Graf ’s daughter to the city’s military commanders, are either blind to the danger or involved in the plot. Middenheim may fall to the enemy within — and if it does, the Empire’s great bastion against threats from the Northern Chaos Wastes becomes a stronghold for the Ruinous Powers.</p>\n<p>None of this is obvious at first glance. The Characters must piece everything together, identify the threats, and tread a political minefield in order to save the Graf, the city, and perhaps the whole of the Empire from a dangerous, cunning, and extremely well-connected foe.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>OPTIONS: GROGNARD BOXES</em></h3>\n<p><em>As in the other volumes in this series, new and alternative material is presented in ‘Grognard boxes’. This material offers the GM various ways to make the </em><em>adventure fresh and challenging for  </em><em>players who have already played the </em><em>original Power Behind the Throne — </em><em>and of course, you are welcome to </em><em>use these options for a first-time </em><em>party as well!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Chapters</h2>\n<p>Power Behind the Throne consists of the following sections.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[AZKZlDd542Pv90gj]{The Road to Middenheim}</h4>\n<p>Having reached Altdorf at the end of Death on the Reik, the Characters have various leads, which all point to Middenheim. They must make arrangements to travel there by road, through the perilous Drakwald.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[IUCl2VoHFTEa2OB3]{Middenheim}</h4>\n<p>This chapter presents background information on the city and its rulers, many of whom are important NPCs in this adventure.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[6Lr7N7BpeiqOSla3]{Initial Inquiries}</h4>\n<p>This chapter covers the various lines of inquiry that the Characters may choose to pursue upon arriving in Middenheim, and provides the GM with ways to draw them into the main plot of the adventure.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[YPpM7Pg44EgT2yt5]{The Carnival}</h4>\n<p>This chapter covers Middenheim’s famous Carnival, which forms the backdrop to the perilous events of the adventure, and gives some special rules for dealing with the Carnival crowds.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[zm2zG5Tw0uj9H3ao]{The Powers that Be}</h4>\n<p>The adventure revolves around the Characters making a favourable impression on at least some of the city’s most prominent people. In this chapter the GM is given advice, resources, and ideas to help keep track of these major NPCs amidst the bustle of the Carnival, and to help deal with the Characters’ efforts to meet and impress them — and, most importantly, to find out what they know.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[jepWFu96Qh64OlHw]{The Traitor Unmasked}</h4>\n<p>As the Characters piece together what is going on, they eventually learn the whereabouts of the villain’s main agent. Raiding this safe house, they rescue a hostage who proves to be the vital piece in the puzzle. Freeing the hostage frees a major NPC from the villain’s control, and the plot begins to unravel.</p>\n<p>The climax of the adventure is a race against time to prevent the traitor from escaping, and doing serious damage to the city in the process.</p>\n<h2>RUNNING THE ADVENTURE</h2>\n<p>The plot of this adventure is extremely complex, and involves a large number of important NPCs. Before running this adventure, it is recommended that the GM reads through the whole of this book very carefully, paying particular attention to the last three chapters.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/cover-adventure.webp","folder":"xOq4e4h3j8j4DtZs","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Power Behind the Throne","sort":0}}}

In theory, anyone may issue a challenge (including any Character), but members of the City Guard weed out the time-wasters (anyone with Strength or Weapon Skill below 30). Two challengers are chosen by lot each day.</p>\n<p>All challengers must pay an entrance fee of @Pay[3gc]{3 GCs} before the combat, and sign a document swearing never to take up arms against the Todbringer family, their servants and subjects, and undertaking, if successful, to serve the Graf as champion until defeated in combat.</p>\n<p>Dieter has been undefeated for four years, so there are few challengers. If a qualified Character issues a challenge, you may roll dice to represent the drawing of lots, but the Character’s lot is automatically drawn if you think it desirable. </p>\n<p>Anyone who tries to even the odds — for example by bribing Dieter — faces disappointment and considerable trouble. Dieter refuses to be bribed, and is mortally offended by the mere suggestion.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE RULES OF COMBAT</em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>No Magic</strong>. Both combatants are inspected by a wizard before the combat begins. His ornate, silver-banded black wand glows blue if either party is under the effects of any spell, enchantment, or magic item. If this happens, the offender is expelled from the event, and pelted with fruit by an enthusiastic crowd.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Armour</strong>. Both contestants wear a sleeved mail coat, a mail coif, and a helmet. If both parties agree on a one-handed weapon (see below), then both may use a shield as well.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Weapons</strong>. Any hand-to-hand weapon may be used, but both combatants must use the same type of weapon: swords or quarter-staves are normal. If both parties cannot agree on the choice of weapons, a senior member of the City Guardadjudicates — usually in favour of the existing Champion. <br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Subdual</strong>. Combat is not to the death: the fighters must @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.Ssod4QuBdyMS6F79]{Pull their Blows}, which means that their attacks cannot cause Critical Wounds. A combatant is defeated when their Wounds  are reduced to zero — the adjudicators are very experienced in judging when a fighter has reached this point.  If any blow is clearly struck in anger or with intent to maim or kill, a half-dozen Watchmen separate the contestants and drag the offender off to the cells.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Defeat</h4>\n<p>Dieter never loses to a NPC challenger. An unsuccessful challenger is prohibited from challenging again for another two years, but the crowd may still cheer for a valiant loser.</p>\n<h4>Victory</h4>\n<p>A defeat does not bother Dieter unduly, since he wants to get married, and has been thinking about stepping down from his post anyway. If the Character is a gracious victor, for example, congratulating Dieter on a fight well fought and complimenting him on his past record, Dieter may invite them out for a celebratory drink. At your option, he may be accompanied by @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}, @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}, and @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}, giving the Characters a chance to make their acquaintance.</p>\n<p>The winner receives a splendid silver medallion (1 GC) and cup (30 GCs). The medallion is awarded for life, but the cup must be passed on to whomever next becomes the Graf ’s champion.</p>\n<p>The new champion’s name is inscribed on a massive copy of the cup, which is displayed in the square during the contest, and kept in the Treasury at other times. In addition, an appreciative crowd may throw small change to the value of [[/r 1d10]] silver shillings, if they enjoyed the fight.</p>\n<p>If Dieter loses one of the early bouts, his successor must face any subsequent challenges. These challengers are of similar ability to the Character (perhaps a point of two lower here and there, if you are  feeling kind). Obviously, it makes sense to challenge Dieter close to the end of the event!</p>\n<p>The winner of the eighth and final combat is inducted as the Graf ’s champion, and must take a lengthy oath (backed up by a long and complex legal document) undertaking to serve the Graf faithfully and well as his champion. The character may elect to enter the career of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.RNcsFphKVYohTrS9]{Duelist} for free, though this is not compulsory. A speech is customary at this point: let the player improvise one, and judge how favourably it impresses the crowd, and any major NPCs who are present. The following are likely to be crowd pleasers: mentioning the greatness of Middenheim, the might of Ulric, or the excellent quality of the Carnival .</p>\n<p>After the ceremony, the new champion is summoned (alone) to a brief audience with the three @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Midden Marshals}. At your option, any Character who catches their eye may be summoned before them. After an initial round of pleasantries, @Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{von Genscher} inquires about the Character’s hometown and background. All three Marshals stress the duties and responsibilities of the Graf ’s champion, the social and political aspects of the position, and so on. If the Characters have already been active among the major NPCs, von Genscher tactfully inquires about their goals and intentions.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the Character have the opportunity to question the Marshals subtly — though they will not appreciate being grilled. If the character impresses the Marshals — and especially if the event @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{‘Chaos Strikes by Night’} has already been concluded successfully — the Marshals will be more open, expressing concern about the political situation while emphasising their determination to remain above politics for the sake of their military duty.</p>\n<h4>Audience with the Graf</h4>\n<p>After the investiture, the new champion is summoned to the palace for a brief audience with the Graf himself. Like the Marshals, the Graf stresses the duties of the post, saying nothing that the Character has not heard before. At this formal interview, the new champion is not given the opportunity to do anything except nod, bow, and express thanks for the honour of the post.</p>\n<p>This is an opportunity for the Character to see the Graf, and realise how much he is struggling under the crushing weight of his despair. He rambles, trails off, and repeats himself several times during his speech, and one or more of the NPCs present tries to keep him on track. However, if the new Champion is truly respectful of the Graf, and shows commitment to the role, do allow the Graf a moment of clarity to nod slowly and praise them for their victory over Deiter. </p>\n<p>For further advice on portraying Graf Boris Todbringer, see @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Boris Todbringer}.</p>\n<p>There is much to gain in terms of networking with important NPCs as the audience might include the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess,’} one of more Marshals, the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, and perhaps a Law Lord: many of the city’s great and good are curious about the new champion.</p>\n<p>This event is attended by the following NPCs</p>\n<p><strong>Wellentag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} (participating)</p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulric Schutzmann}</p>\n<p>@Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Johann Schwermutt}</p>\n<p>@Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen}</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<p>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}</p>\n<p><strong>Aubentag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} (participating)</p>\n<p>@Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Maximillian von Genscher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<p><strong>Marktag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} (participating)</p>\n<p>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}</p>\n<p>@Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}</p>\n<p>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert}</p>\n<p><strong>Backertag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} (participating)</p>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulric Schutzmann}</p>\n<p>@Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Johann Schwermutt}</p>\n<p>@Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Maximillian von Genscher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}</p>\n<p>@Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich}</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/bow.webp\" width=\"563\" height=\"83\" /></div>\n<h4>The Archery Tournament (Wellentag-Marktag, 2–4:00 p.m.)</h4>\n<p>@Item[Hebu3guCAjmMQTKe]{Archery Extended Test}</p>\n<p>There is no entrance fee, but those who wish to enter must look reasonably presentable.

Each archer fires with a bow or shortbow — no longbows, elf bows, or crossbows allowed, and, of course, not so much as a whiff of gunpowder. Shooters stand 30 yd away from a circular target. The target consists of five coloured rings of increasing size: the white bullseye; red; yellow; blue; and green. Each archer fires three arrows, and the score is totalled. Each day’s winner receives @Item[vgB2U955vbD8iJsP]{Silver Archery Prize}.

The results of either approach depend on the circumstances, the soundness of the Players’ plan, and the luck of the dice.</p>\n<p>If Gräber is in the cave and suspects that there is someone outside, he sends a lone skull out to investigate.

In this version, @Actor[YTjyvukWNRORQcg6]{Kurt} is a Zombie, left to guard the lair when Gräber is out.</em></p>\n<p><em>This difference should give grognards a shock when they enter the cave. In the first place, trying to smoke out the cave’s occupants, as in the original, will have no effect on undead Kurt. If the Characters enter the cave, they see an armoured figure coming toward them, and in the uncertain light they may not be able to tell that he is not living. If the Players remember the original Kurt’s somewhat negotiable sense of loyalty, they </em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">may call on him to surrender, offering bribes and making threats — until they see the empty look in his eyes, by which time he might well be within striking distance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">There is no help or information from Kurt this time.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>A. Entrance</h3>\n<p>When Gräber is out, two candles provide faint illumination in the passage leading into the cave. If the Characters make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test, they find recent footprints near the entrance.</p>\n<h3>B. Bend</h3>\n<p>The passage turns at this point. A skull rests on a ledge along the southern wall. A candle sits on the skull, which is covered with melted wax.</p>\n<p>This is a normal skull but has the spell @Item[q1ZeCUT0gYk6KF7r]{Snitch} cast on it. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test reveals that the footprints stay clear of the skull. The spell will activate if a creature comes within 2 yards, informing @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} that intruders are present.</p>\n<p>The passage opens up beyond the skull to reveal a large, candle-lit cave to the right and a cloth screen ahead. Unless forewarned, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} has a torch burning in area E, and its light shines under the curtain. Depending on the time of day and how cautious they have been, the party may hear Gräber muttering to himself — usually rehearsing some grandiose speech for the benefit of a future victim — or lightly snoring.</p>\n<h3>C. Store</h3>\n<p>This area is filled with enough food and water to last one person about two weeks, as well as a stack of pre-made torches, a few dozen candles, and whatever miscellaneous supplies the GM cares to add. A Small individual could hide behind the stores, until someone took something from the piles.</p>\n<h3>D. Bone Cave</h3>\n<p>The floor of the cave is littered with bones, except for an open area in the centre where skulls of various types — some animal, some warped, and some Human-looking — are laid out in a circle. @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} started with 40 of the things, and any not captured or destroyed by the Characters or currently being used by the Necromancer are found here in a dormant state.</p>\n<h3>E. Gräber’s Camp</h3>\n<p>Gräber’s living quarters are behind a sack-cloth curtain. Unless previously encountered, @Actor[YTjyvukWNRORQcg6]{Kurt} stands at the back. A torch, its butt-end stuck in a small bucket of dirt, provides light if Gräber is there. A bedroll is the only furniture.</p>\n<h4>The Final Battle</h4>\n<p>If the GM has not decided to keep the Characters in a continued state of frustration by having @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} flee before being cornered or ambushed, the climactic battle takes place here.</p>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} tactics vary according to his evaluation of his opponents. If the party seems to be small, weak, or seriously wounded, he may decide to fight to the death. He is more likely, however, to try to create an opportunity to escape.</p>\n<p>While working to perfect his control of the skulls, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} did not neglect the rest of the bones. Each morning, he casts @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.7BJDTRG65hwt1fUK]{Reanimate} on them, and at his command a number of headless @Actor[zDmykIAVWRBfTIJx]{Skeletons} haul themselves upright and move to attack the Characters. The exact number is up to the GM. According to the rules the spell raises a number of @Actor[zDmykIAVWRBfTIJx]{Skeletons} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies} equal to the caster’s Willpower Bonus + SL. The GM can roll the necessary dice in front of the Players if desired, or pre-roll before running the adventure and make a note of how many will rise, or simply pick a number. If the combat seems to be going a bit too easily, a few more headless Skeletons might pull themselves together enough to join the battle.</p>\n<p>At @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} command, the @Actor[zDmykIAVWRBfTIJx]{Skeletons} (and @Actor[05HjHIxiQgPWIpOf]{Kurt} the Zombie too, if he is present) move to grapple the Characters. Gräber plans to have them hold the intruders and push them back, creating a clear passage for him to run out of the cave and thwarting any attempts at pursuit. If all the Characters are grappled, he feels confident enough to treat each one with a spell like @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.HqInHmOviuLqymdm]{Screaming Skull} from the Lore of Necromancy, or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.vEuljwoWR2rOTU5y]{Caress of Laniph}, or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.ifjDVtgGEh787p20]{Steal Life} from the Lore of Death, delivering a suitably bombastic speech as he does so. His distinctive nasal whine somewhat diminishes the effect, but he does not know that.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: </em><em>WHAT ABOUT THE WARPSTONE?</em></h3>\n<p><em>In the original ‘The Grapes of Wrath’, the skulls were powered by warpstone, and a small piece was found beneath each one, except for the spot where @Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder Lechart} dug up his ‘lucky charm’. Not so in this version.</em></p>\n<p><em>Wuder’s piece was a chance find, once the prized possession of a Beastman who died here. Gräber relies on an obscure necromantic spell to animate and control the skulls, and not on warpstone. The Skaven have been cut, as will be seen, and so much warpstone would be dangerous for a party of adventurers, especially one that is on its way to one of the Empire’s major cities.</em></p>\n<p><em>Grognard GMs are free to replace the warpstone if they wish, but they must be willing to deal with the complication it will add to the adventure. And if grognard Players decide to spend some time digging around on the floor of this cave hoping to find warpstone, let them. Perhaps they find another small piece, lying among the bones that litter the cave. Or, more likely, they will be on their knees with their backs to the entrance when Gräber or @Actor[YTjyvukWNRORQcg6]{Kurt} finds them.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS:  WHAT ABOUT OTTO BALDURICH?</em></h3>\n<p><em>In the second edition version of ‘The Grapes of Wrath’ from </em>Plundered Vaults<em>, Seel Baldurich’s uncle Otto, a journeyman wizard from Middenheim, has been summoned to the area by a letter from his nephew, and is camping in the woods near the village. In this adventure he is absent, but the GM can certainly allow grognard Players to waste time by having the Characters scour the woods for him if desired.</em></p>\n<p><em>If the Characters need some extra help in the final confrontation, muscle can be provided by a patrol of 2–4 road wardens sent from Schöninghagen in response to the report made by Hedric the coachman. After searching the road from Schöninghagen to Grubentreich, the patrol finds its way to @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} just after the Characters set out for Gräber’s lair, and arrives fortuitously just when things are looking bleak for the party.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: WHAT ABOUT THE SKAVEN?</em></h3>\n<p><em>The original version of ‘The Grapes of Wrath’ featured a group of Skaven, attracted by the warpstone in the cave. In this version, there is far less warpstone, so there are no Skaven: the Characters’ lives are quite complicated enough. Again, grognards who insist on looking for Skaven or preparing for a Skaven attack should be allowed to waste as much time and resources as they like in doing so.</em></p>\n<p><em>If the Characters seem to be having too easy a time, though, they might run into some Skaven. Snikkit and his band from @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{Chaos Strikes by Night} are currently en route to Middenheim to kidnap Law Lord @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich’s} niece, and several other bands of Skaven are converging on the city. If you already have <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, you may wish to foreshadow events to come by introducing some Clan Mange clanrats, though care should be taken not to send the party on a wild chase into the Skaven-infested @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Undercity} of Middenheim just yet.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"O0HfGcMmqK25GSdm","sort":612500,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":612500}}}

The GM may prefer to roleplay every visit to each market, hawker, or shop, meaning Tests for Availability are unrequired as the GM simply states what is or isn’t purchasable.

If an item costs less than your Status level — so if you have a Status of Silver 2, any item costing 2 silver shillings or less — you are assumed to be able to buy as much as needed of that item.

As a general rule-of-thumb, villages have a single item in stock, towns have [[/r 1d10]] items, and cities have as many as the GM deems appropriate. These quantities are generally doubled for Common items, and halved for Rare ones (rounding up).</p>\n<h3>Bargaining and Trading</h3>\n<p>People of the Empire love a good bargain, and crowds of eager shoppers fill town squares every day looking for the best deals. When buying goods, there are two primary Skills to Test: Evaluate and Haggle.</p>\n<p>Evaluate is used by consumers to identify the quality of an item. Similarly, the vendor can use Evaluate to appraise coins for their exchange value, or spot counterfeits. Anyone can also use Evaluate to estimate the prices of Rare or Exotic items to within +/-10%.</p>\n<p>Haggle is used routinely by consumers and vendors alike, typically with Opposed Tests. Haggling is expected and most prices are marked up slightly to account for this. Winning a Haggle Test reduces the price by 10% (or possibly up to 20% with an Astounding Success (6+) or with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.epPBu7x6BRWp2PHG]{Dealmaker} Talent). Failing a Haggle contest badly usually means the vendor distrusts your coinage.</p>\n<h4>Roleplaying Shopping Trips</h4>\n<p>Trips to the market for routine purchases don’t need to be roleplayed in detail. The GM might prefer you browse the equipment lists and check for Availability yourself. Major purchases that involve item Craftsmanship, or require extra Haggling, can be fun to roleplay in-character. In certain scenarios, shopkeepers are important NPCs with distinct personalities or story roles, so it’s always worth interacting with them. Consider the following when roleplaying shopping:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The GM may overrule Availability as dictated by local details. For example, basic rowboats are automatically available if the adventure is located in a fishing village that features a renowned boat-builder.</li>\n<li>Availability percentages can be increased by +10% or +20%if a character is especially diligent, belongs to a relevant career such as Merchant or Fence, or spends an entire day shopping and making Gossip Tests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Selling</h3>\n<p>Selling your trappings during desperate times, or simply offloading loot, is handled in exactly the same fashion as Buying, but this time you’ll be making money, not spending it. So, you first check for Availability of a buyer in the same fashion as checking for stock. You then bargain and trade, with Evaluate Tests and Haggle Tests as the GM prefers, and finally you set a price. Typically, the base cost when selling is half the item’s listed price, meaning, when selling second-hand, you usually make between a quarter to half an item’s worth after Haggling.</p>\n<p>If you have a Career like fence or merchant, and you put time into Gossip Tests and wandering the local town, you might find someone willing to pay up to 80% of the item’s listed value, though that is left in the hands of the GM.</p>\n<h4>Lowering the Price</h4>\n<p>If you can’t find a buyer, you can try lowering the price. Each time you half the money you are willing to accept, the Availability of a buyer increases by one step.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Corporal Mauser has fled his State Army regiment with a Hochland Longrifle he stole, and is keen to sell. As it’s an Exotic item, there are no immediate buyers he can find on the street. The GM determines the base price Mauser can expect is half the weapon’s value (so 50GC, half of the 100GC it’s worth), so Mauser decides to drop the price by half two times, saying he will accept 12GC 10/–, which increases the Availability of a Buyer two steps from Exotic to Scarce.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Bartering</h3>\n<p>Rural and mercantile commerce often involves trading one commodity for another without exchanging money. To resolve bartering of this type, compare the Availability of the items being traded against those being acquired. The barter ratio indicates how many ‘units’ must be traded, and how many ‘units’ of the other commodity are acquired. ‘Units’ are defined by checking the equipment list prices of both items and grouping them into packages of roughly equivalent value.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Bartering Ratios</h3>\n<table style=\"width:460px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center\"><strong>Traded Items</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">Scare</td>\n<td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center\">Exotic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">2:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center\">4:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center\">8:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center\">Scarce</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center\">2:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center\">4:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:4</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center\">2:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center\">Exotic</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:8</td>\n<td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center\">1:4</td>\n<td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center\">1:1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":"BrtIycD1u7HxITud","sort":693750,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide","sort":500001}}}

About a century ago, there was an abortive attempt by Emperor Dieter IV to sieze control of the few small gold mines in the area, but this provoked such a reaction from the Dwarfs of the Grey Mountains that the matter was quietly forgotten, and the Frugelhorn valley is not claimed by either nation.</p>\n<p>The Frugelhofers are a mixture of Bretonnian and Imperial stock, as can be seen from their surnames.</p>\n<p>One by-product of the peculiar political situation (or non-situation) is the fact that Frugelhofers have been able to survive on a very low income because they don&rsquo;t pay taxes to anyone. The villagers get by in a variety of ways. The Bergmans go trapping, while Henri Brioche is a miller, baker, and brewer all in one, and the Papins supplement their small income through the store. Other villagers make their money in a variety of ways. The main resources of the Frugelhorn valley are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Herb gathering: </strong>Speckled Rustwort (see TEW) grows on the northern side of the valley, and fetches a fair price in Grunere.</li>\n<li><strong>Fishing: </strong>despite its cold and rushing waters, the Vaswaser has a few eels, and a type of albino carp can be caught in the chill, clear meltwater streams below the Frugelhorn Glacier.</li>\n<li><strong>Livestock: </strong>herding is the main activity in Frugelhofen, and most families keep at least a few goats and chickens. Some breed rabbits, for fur as well as for meat.<br />There are a few cattle - mainly belonging to the Widow Le Roux - but the pasture in the high mountains is not sufficient to support a large herd all the year round.</li>\n<li><strong> Trapping: </strong>as we have mentioned, the Bergman brothers are trappers, and other Frugelhofers set snares for rabbits and other small game in the area around the village.</li>\n<li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> the soil is fairly fertile but the winters are very cold, and only very hardy grains can survive. Some oats and barley are grown in small fields close to the Vaswasser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t need to know which villagers do what, but you can always add a little colour to PC observations by telling them how demented old Mr Lutter is nattering to this long-haired Tilean River Rabbit as they stroll past. Likewise, you can easily add some extras to the list of basics. For example, Alain Gascoigne could be a falconer, and have a pair of trained hawks which hunt coney in the valley and the like.</p>\n<h3>A Note on Language</h3>\n<p>Most of the inhabitants of Frugelhofen can speak and understand both the Imperial and Bretonnian dialects of Old Worlder. However, you can have a little fun with language if you like. Because Frugelhofen is so isolated, and its inhabitants rarely converse with outsiders, you might like to rule that - although Frugelhofers can understand each other perfectly &mdash; their dialect is particularly impenetrable in some cases.</p>\n<p>Old Reinwald Lutter speaks only Reikspiel; he understands Bretonnian, but pretends not to, and his thick, slurring dialect is totally incomprehensible to non-Imperials. The Bergman brothers, likewise, speak thick Reikspiel and enjoy taunting Bretonnians. The Lauterbach brothers do the same sometimes, although strangely, they and the Bergmans hate the sight of each other. By contrast, the snobbish Lagisquets always speak courtly Bretonnian to strangers, believing that this is a mark of culture. The children &mdash; all those aged 10 or less, at any rate &mdash; speak a hybrid patois among themselves, made up of elements of both dialects and almost incomprehensible to anyone else; a character with Linguistics skill will be able to make some sense of it on a successful Int test.</p>\n<p>Communication problems can provide an occasional amusement, but don&rsquo;t overdo it and be careful not to let it get in the way of the action. The PCs shouldn't have too much difficulty talking to these ordinary people, but there is the occasional exception.</p>\n<h3>Major NPCs</h3>\n<p>Four unusual visitors are staying in Frugelhofen at present; they will probably draw the PCs&rsquo; interest, and later on in the adventure a lot can depend on the impression which the PCs make on them.</p>\n<p>The first of these, the Elven assassin Shalyir Moonhand, is in Frugelhofen trailing a distant cousin of a noble house in Bordeleaux; a more exalted relative wants this individual silenced as the only witness to a spectacular indiscretion. She has just realised that the trail has grown cold, and is wondering what to do next at this dead end.</p>\n<p>Shalyir met Albi Schutz selling fake herbal remedies in Parravon, and on a whim she helped him escape from a vengeful crowd who had discovered that their only properties were laxative. She has noticed Albi&rsquo;s Disguise skill, and she is hoping to learn this from him in due course. As an assassin, it&rsquo;s a useful skill to have.</p>\n<p>Shalyir does not say openly what she is, nor whom she is pursuing. She says she is an adventurer whose travels have left her kicking her heels in this backwater. She is unlikely to agree to help the PCs in their work, and she is distant with most folk except Elves. She is ascetic in her habits, and a cool person under pressure.</p>\n<p>Shalyir is also well aware of what else has happened to Albi. This immoral rogue has fallen head over heels in love with the cool, dispassionate Elf. His normal bravado has deserted him, and he&rsquo;s too inhibited to tell her, but he does really awful things like composing poems about her in his writing books. He is beginning to pine, and hardly eats any more. He drinks too much.</p>\n<p>He even stays in the local barn just to be near where she is (he says he&rsquo;s here for the scenery, which is very colourful). This is sad, sad stuff which can be mercilessly exploited by a mean-spirited GM.</p>\n<p>Alain Gascoigne&rsquo;s case is a sad one. Obviously depressed, Alain does not complain about his lot and just gets on with his work. It is noticeable that no-one calls on him at home, although everyone is happy to speak to him in the village.</p>\n<p>At the GM&rsquo;s option, a PC in a Warrior career may be allowed an Int test to detect the remnants of a military gait in Gascoigne&rsquo;s step, even now. He may discuss this if approached in a friendly way, and he will warm to a younger male PC who obviously wants to listen and learn. He is a decent man, and a fair fighter, and the PCs would do well to befriend him.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is Cecil de Vere Chomondely (&ldquo;pronounced Chumley, don&rsquo;t you know&rdquo;), the visitor from Albion. He is is a complete charlatan, who has been freeloading his way across Bretonnia for almost a year. He ran into Gilles Papin in Grun&eacute;re while down on his luck, and by seer to be a noble, the Duke of Wartsingham, Baron of Wartsand Hall etc, has impressed the snobbish Papins into letting him stay as long as he likes. He has managed to borrow 10 GCs from them already, claiming that it cannot be long before his servant arrives from Parravon with &ldquo;three or four chests of gold and some other essentials\".</p>\n<p>The natives of Albion are famous for their eccentric version of Old Worlder and their almost complete lack of talent with languages. Cecil is no exception, and although he can make himself understood in Old Worlder, his Albion accent and traces of dialect can make him somewhat painful to listen to at times.<br />The PCs will probably conclude that Cecil is no use to anyone except himself, and this is undoubtedly true.<br />One can tell at a glance that, at the first sign of unpleasantness, he will be over the hills and far away.</p>\n<p>However, Cecil has one item of importance. His light fingers managed to acquire a magical dagger from a victim in Poussenc. This weapon might be useful to the PCs if they can get it away from him.</p>\n<h3>Good Impressions</h3>\n<p>These NPCs are of major importance because they allhave something to contribute to the defence of Frugelhofen &mdash; and of La Maisontaal when the time comes for the last battle.</p>\n<p>From the beginning, you should keep track of the impression which the PCs make on Shalyir, Albi and Alain. Cecil, of course, is a complete bounder ruled entirely by self-interest, and his behaviour will not be changed in the least by his opinion of the PCs.</p>\n<p>Shalyir: Respect is the key word here. Shalyir responds well to polite (and stylish) flattery, and displays of courtesy and chivalry from males with fair Fel scores are fine, but she does not want to be pestered with unwanted attentions. Prying questions are not appreciated.</p>\n<p>Albi: Friendly and happy-go-lucky companionship goes down well with Albi. A drinking companion must also listen sympathetically as a drunken Albi pours out his undying love for Shalyir. Commending Albi on his poems (which are awful, even when Albi is sober) goes down well. Aloofness, being snobbish, putting on airs and graces, not drinking too much with him, and apparently flirting with Shalyir all go down badly with Albi.</p>\n<p>Alain: Quiet courtesy, and respect from a Warrior/ a a PC, go down weil with Alain. Boisterousness, mockery, and failure to observe the customs of the villagers go badly.</p>\n<p>On the Adventure Log, you will find an NPC roster for each of these three, with spaces for recording good impressions and bad impressions. Make a note on the rosters each time one or more PCs does something the NPC likes or dislikes. The goodwill of these three NPCs will be important later on.</p>\n<h3>Events and Encounters in Frugelhofen</h3>\n<p>The odds are that the PCs will want ot get down to sniffing out burial mounds right away, and they may have a lead to old Bardak the Dwarf loremaster already.<br />But we know that things are going to get complicated in a little while, and a lot will depend on the impression that the PCs have made on the villagers, and especially on the major NPCs. So we have to keep them in Frugelhofen long enough to make an impression &mdash; meet people, interact with them, pick up a few cunningly-placed clues, and so on.</p>\n<p>So - for their own good - the PCs have to be kept in the village for the first two days. This isn&rsquo;t too hard to arrange: on the first day, the weather closes in so badly that no-one can go anywhere, and the second day is a festival day, when the PCs will get roped into the communal jollities whether they like it or not. While they are in the village, the PCs can talk to NPCs, gather information, and generally be in the best position to receive the rather worrying series of reports that will start coming in...</p>"}

Any friendly Character, of any species, gains his immediate attention, and a positive interaction — especially one involving food, drink, or other pleasures — might get them invited to the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}.</p>\n<p>Pavarotti is happy to talk about medical matters with any suitably skilled Character, but even happier to indulge in food, drink, and other activities with any characters who can keep up with him. He is intrigued to learn of the Characters’ suspicions about @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, and can diagnose and reverse his hypnotism if the Characters think to involve him.</p>\n<p>Outside of the Carnival events, a good way for the Characters to meet Pavarotti is on a darkened, quiet street very late one night. The Doktor runs by them, laughing and clutching his trousers and boots in one hand as an outraged spouse pursues him, dressed in a nightshirt, nightcap, and carpet slippers and brandishing a blunderbuss. Perhaps the Doktor stumbles or stubs a bare toe, leaving him momentarily at the mercy of his pursuer; if the Characters can step in, knock the barrel of the gun upward before it fires, or do anything else to help him, Pavarotti insists on treating them to an epic drinking session which lasts at least until dawn and probably until noon. Thereafter, if the Characters have proven to be good companions, Pavarotti becomes their fast friend — which can be useful but also exhausting, as he insists on going drinking with them all night, every night.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Pavarotti does not know many of the other major NPCs well, and regards even fewer of them as friends. However, he can be useful in getting the Characters into all manner of drinking establishments, identifying the Pit as a good place to buy illicit substances — and, of course, freeing @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} from his post-hypnotic suggestion.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A RED HERRING</em></h3>\n<p><em>If you  wish, and if they are feeling supremely confident, it may be beneficial to introduce at least some of the Law Lords before the final act of the adventure. After all, if the Players feel that you have been steering them away from the Law Lords — they may well begin to smell a rat. It might also be more satisfying if the Characters, upon finally unmasking the culprit, feel that clues as to their identity were laid down earlier in the narrative. The principal risk is that a Character figures out early on who the culprit is. If you decide to be daring and allow them to meet Wasmeier, you should be careful in how you present him. If he comes off as obviously evil, then players unconsciously begin to suspect him. Conversely, if you overcompensate by making him too friendly or helpful, this appears just as suspicious. </em></p>\n<p><em>The best presentation for @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} is the one which he already shows to the people of Middenheim — that of a somewhat aloof but dedicated and fair arbitrator of the law, and a neutral advisor to the Graf. Consider having him deflect any concerns about his role in the new taxes by muttering that, while the Law Lords present a single opinion to the Graf, he certainly didn’t vote for it. If the Characters pester him for assistance, have him direct them to gather some arbitrary number of signatures from the populace, which he promises to present to the Graf on their behalf. It will make for decent kindling, if nothing else. Wasmeier is happy to have inquisitive Characters tied up in such busy work, though undoubtedly he will also keep a close eye on anyone that seems too dedicated to their inquiries, and will send some muscle to deal with anyone who he deems to be a risk.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/luigi-pavarotti.webp","folder":"9nJ4brecw2MRO3vH","sort":1500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":1500000}}}

{"_id":"ly0IZ8Zr8FwkhFix","name":"Griscourt","content":"<p>Griscourt is defended by a tall, wooden palisade and a large gatehouse set between two drystone towers. Normally the gates are guarded by archers who patrol the perimeter and watch for danger from the towers, but when the Characters arrive, this is not the case.<br />There are two large barns to the north of the village. One of these has been destroyed by the Jabberslythe. The other contains a herd of 12 goats.<span style=\"font-family:ACaslonPro-Regular;font-size:9pt;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal\"><br style=\"font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;line-height:normal;text-align:-webkit-auto;text-size-adjust:auto\" /></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Through the shattered gates is a scene of shocking devastation. The village has been subjected to an attack of sudden, intense violence.</p>\n<p>Many of the small cottages that stood here have been pulled apart, reduced to piles of wood and reed. Tongues of flame rise from some of these piles. The palisade that rings the village has been torn apart in places, the heavy stakes reduced to matchwood. Corpses are strewn about like wheatsheafs after harvest, and the heavy impressions of huge, four-toed feet lead a winding path through the carnage. To your left an inn still stands undamaged. Raised voices echo from within. To your right smoke rises from the interior of a small village forge, and a tall stone keep proudly dominates the skyline before you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Cottages</h2>\n<p>Most buildings in Griscourt are poor peasant dwellings consisting of just one or two rooms. The cottages have solid walls constructed in varying degrees of drystone wall, wooden planking, and wattle-and-daub. They are topped with steeply sloping roofs of thick reed thatching. Many of these dwellings have been pulled apart by the Jabberslythe. Furthermore, some of the ruined cottages have caught on fire. The burning cottages may well concern the Characters, and certainly add to the hellish atmosphere of the scene, but left to their own devices they will eventually burn themselves out without spreading further.</p>\n<p>A large copper still has been erected next to one of the intact cottages to the north of the village. This is the residence of Émile Brasseur, the<span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> village’s brewer. He has survived the attack and can be found in the forge.</span></p>\n<h2>What Happened</h2>\n<p>The Jabberslythe attacked a few hours before dawn when most of the villagers were asleep. It began its frenzied assault by flying around the gatehouse, killing the confused guards and wrecking the tower. It then landed in the village courtyard by the well. From there it rampaged about in an indiscriminate fashion before cornering a group of unfortunate villagers near the keep. There it was dealt a number of deep wounds by Griscourt’s determined lord, Theodelain de Griscourt, but this initially did little more than anger the enormous beast. The Jabberslythe tore the knight’s head from his shoulders, but by then it had been reduced to a wretched state and was bleeding from many grievous wounds. The beast took to the air and flew to a nearby resting place — a dark cave used by the villagers as a cool house.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are proactive during their time in the village they will be able to prevent a number of the villagers from hurting themselves or their neighbours. However, if they waste time then additional disasters will take place in Griscourt.</p>\n<p>There is also the matter of the Jabberslythe. It has retreated to recuperate in a cool cave to the east, and steadily regains its strength as a result of its regenerative abilities. At the start of the adventure the Jabberslythe is reduced to 15 wounds and suffers from a Broken Jaw (2 Fatigued Conditions), a Devastated Eye (3 Blinded, 2 Bleeding, and 1 Fatigued Condition), a Broken Nose (2 Bleeding Conditions) and Bruised Ribs (−10 to Agility Tests).

{"_id":"m2iCtJ3eBsUwP0Dd","name":"You Are Feeling Sleepy...","content":"<p>This section covers what might happen if the Characters discover that @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} has been hypnotised into supporting the tax changes, and attempt to undo the hypnosis. If they can do this, and if Dieter is still the Graf ’s Champion, they have turned one of @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} unwitting pawns into a useful ally of their own.</p>\n<p>Discovery</p>\n<p>The Characters may notice something strange about @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter’s} attitude to the tax changes simply by talking to him. His NPC Sheet includes several set phrases that he is compelled to repeat in response to questions about the taxes. When talking about related matters — say, Dwarfs in general — Dieter is under no such compulsion, and may contradict himself. If questioned about this, Dieter does not see that his statements are incompatible.</p>\n<p>This encounter should be played very carefully: on the one hand, Dieter’s mind has been tampered with; but on the other, the effects are not readily apparent. If the Players are having trouble, the Characters might make a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test to notice a subtle change in Dieter’s behaviour when talking about the taxes: a glazed look in the eyes; a slight lack of emotion in his voice; and so on. A character with the @Item[vXJq3j6MGR3oThG0]{Hypnotism} Skill recognises the condition straight away, and knows what to do about it (see ‘De-hypnotising Dieter,’ below).</p>\n<p>A final hint for struggling Players — and this might happen anyway — occurs if Dieter gets very drunk. Just before unconsciousness, the effects of the alcohol will temporarily negate the effects of the hypnotism, and Dieter can converse about the taxes as he thinks fit — if somewhat slurred. When he sobers up, however, the hypnosis will be operative again.</p>\n<h3>What To Do?</h3>\n<p>Assuming the party has realised that Dieter is under some sort of charm or mental control, they probably want to do something about it.</p>\n<p>Questioning Dieter when he is drunk produces little information: in this state Dieter can barely talk, and is a long way from remembering who hypnotised him. Characters may make an <strong>Average (+20) Hypnotism</strong> or <strong>Difficult (–10) Heal</strong> Test to realise that the symptoms point to hypnosis, which can only be lifted by someone with Hypnotism Skill. If none of the Characters has this Skill, there are a few other options:</p>\n<h4>Carnival Entertainers</h4>\n<p>It may be difficult to find a genuine hypnotist at the Carnival, as opposed to a charlatan with a good sales pitch. However, if the Characters are prepared to ask around, they can find someone suitable. Treat this individual as a standard entertainer or charlatan with Hypnotism Skill. Dr Woldo or Walda Zeggesmund seems an appropriate sort of name. The initial cost for a de-hypnosis will be @Pay[1gc]{1 GC}, rising to @Pay[3gc]{3 GCs} if Dr Zeggesmund learns whom he or she is to hypnotise, and @Pay[6gc]{6 GCs} if @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} is unwilling.</p>\n<p>This will be the least favourite option of any other major NPCs, if the Characters have made their acquaintance. All of them will worry about entrusting a wandering entertainer with such a delicate matter, with the potential to cause a scandal and to threaten the city’s security. One miscreant has already compromised the Graf ’s Champion: who is to say whether another hypnotist — especially one who will be gone at the end of the week, if not before — might not place an even more dangerous suggestion in his mind?</p>\n<h4>The Physicians’ Guild</h4>\n<p>@JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Middenheim’s Physicians’ Guild} is rather fussy about whom it accepts. In the eyes of the Physicians’ Guild Council hypnotism smacks of charlatanry. However, if the Characters fail to find a hypnotist anywhere else, and if they are careful about how they approach the Guild, they may be successful here. The initial price quoted will be @Pay[3gc]{3GCs}, @Pay[6gc]{doubling} once the physician learns the patient’s identity.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{The Temple of Shallya}</h4>\n<p>If handled correctly (perhaps with a story about a friend with a mental ailment that seems to have been induced by hypnosis), enquiries here provide the party with the services of Maria Ferberg, who — although still a novice — has decent powers of hypnosis (Hypnotism 55). While no charge is made for her services, a donation to the temple is expected.</p>\n<h4>The Good Doctor</h4>\n<p>The Characters might hear a rumour (at the @JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Physicians’ Guild}, for example) that @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan’s} improvement is due to a powerful hypnotic influence exerted by @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}. This could place them in a dilemma.</p>\n<p>Firstly, having heard various unsavoury things about Pavarotti, they might conclude that the Tilean is behind @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter’s} condition. They might even conclude that he is behind the whole plot, and take some rash action against him. This would alienate a powerful potential ally, but on its own this one setback should not make the adventure impossible to complete successfully.</p>\n<p>If they resist this red herring; the Characters might try to arrange a meeting with Pavarotti, and try to persuade him to treat Dieter in addition to sounding him out for other information. If Pavarotti sees that Dieter has been hypnotised, he begins to take an active interest in the situation, and may be of considerable help.</p>\n<h4>Other Major NPCs</h4>\n<p>In addition to these possibilities, the Characters may wish to discuss the problem with one or more of Dieter’s friends, such as @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane}, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel}, or Dieter’s fiancée, @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}. These NPCs tend to go along with whatever the Characters suggest, provided Dieter is not put at risk.</p>\n<p>None of the three allow Dieter anywhere near a hypnotist from the Carnival. Only Kirsten knows that the @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Baronial Physician} is reputed to have hypnotic powers, but she finds the Tilean a little disturbing, and may need persuading to let him treat Dieter.</p>\n<h3>De-Hypnotising Dieter</h3>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} will not care for the idea of being hypnotised again, even to undo the previous hypnotism: he dislikes the idea of having someone ‘walking about in his mind,’ as he puts it. However, if @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten} both persuade him, he agrees reluctantly.</p>\n<p>Failing persuasion, the Characters might contrive to get Dieter mildly drunk, so that he is unaware of the initial hypnotic contact. However, this raises problems of professional ethics for anyone from the @JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Physicians’ Guild}, and also for Maria Ferberg from the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{temple of Shallya}: neither one will hypnotise someone without their knowledge, unless instructed by their superiors. A Carnival hypnotist will have no such qualms — at least, none that cannot be soothed by a little more gold — while Pavarotti is quite happy to act on his own initiative. For the sake of the following, he is assumed to be the hypnotist: you should make any necessary changes if another character is performing the procedure.</p>\n<p>A quiet, darkened room is necessary. This may be easily arranged: @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} will be happy to have his back room used, for example. @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi} sits Dieter in a comfortable chair, and tells him to fix his eyes on a silver medallion which Luigi will swing before his eyes on a chain. Luigi’s voice drops to a quiet monotone, very different from his usual demeanour.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Look at the disc, the disc, and listen to my voice. Listen to my voice. All you attend to is the disc — watch it swing, you cannot look away from it — and also my voice. As you watch the disc, your eyes are feeling tired, your eyelids are closing, and you are feeling sleepy. You are relaxing, listening to my voice, and feeling sleepy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This continues for a few minutes. After this time, Dieter is hypnotised, and will react only to what Luigi tells him.</p>\n<p>Luigi asks what the Characters want to do. He could remove the effects of Dieter’s previous hypnosis right away, or he could first ask the Champion some questions. Hypnotically induced amnesia can only be overcome in a trance, so this is a good time to ask questions.</p>\n<p>The original hypnosis is already wearing off, so any attempt at negating it succeeds. Some possible questions are detailed below, but it is necessary to improvise answers to other enquiries. The information in italics may be useful.</p>\n<p><strong>When?</strong> ‘Nearly two months ago.”’<strong>Where? </strong>‘The Showboat’ (@JournalEntry[IEjGO7UD5QfWsrV2]{A restaurant} and cabaret in @JournalEntry[UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{the Great Park}.)</p>\n<p>After a night on the town, Dieter had ended up at this upper-class establishment, mildly drunk. Sitting alone in a quiet corner, he was approached by a young woman. @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten} does not like this answer if she is present.</p>\n<p><strong>What was her name?</strong> ‘Charlotte.’ <strong>What did she look like?</strong> ‘Attractive.’ @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten} likes this answer even less.</p>\n<p><strong>Describe her</strong>: ‘Red hair, green eyes, mid-20s, medium height and build. She spoke with a Bretonnian accent.’</p>\n<p>What did she tell him to do? At this, Dieter repeats in sequence all the phrases detailed on his NPC Sheet.</p>\n<p><em>No one knows yet that this was @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} in disguise.</em></p>\n<p>After asking all these questions, or when Dieter fails to answer, Luigi suggests negating the previous hypnosis, and implants strong suggestions in Dieter’s mind against being hypnotised by the same person again. Kirsten agrees to this if she is present.</p>\n<h3>After The Hypnosis</h3>\n<p>Dieter does not remember anything about this session, but he has a vague recollection of being hypnotised before.</p>\n<p>If Maria is the hypnotist, she returns to the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple} and says no more about the incident. Dr Zeggesmund(or any entertainer) probably stays silent on the matter: getting involved in high-society affairs is a dangerous business. Still, he or she may ask for a little extra gold.</p>\n<p>Luigi is intrigued by all he has learned. He is not pleased that someone has exerted hypnotic control over this decent man, although he has a grudging admiration for the original hypnotist’s Skill. He will realise, of course, that skulduggery is afoot, and this makes him more positively disposed toward the Characters.</p>\n<h3>What Can Be Learned</h3>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter’s} eventual response is important. Realising that he has been hypnotised into supporting the new taxes makes him angry. However, he is now on the side of the Characters, as they try to win as many sources of influence as possible. If he has already been defeated as Champion, however, he no longer has any influence to use to help them, but he certainly helps in any other way he can. Any NPC friend of Dieter who learns of the hypnotism is  also well disposed toward the Characters, and provides any further help they can.</p>\n<p>Following up the reference to @JournalEntry[IEjGO7UD5QfWsrV2]{The Showboat} will prove fruitless. Dieter visits fairly often, so his presence was nothing new. In addition, ‘Charlotte’ was very careful not to draw undue attention to herself, approaching Dieter as he sat in one of the secluded booths designed to foil prying eyes. The only other clue worth having is the fact that @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} did not hypnotise Dieter. If the party were suspicious of him before, this fact points towards his innocence.</p>","folder":"9nJ4brecw2MRO3vH","sort":1662500,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":1662500}}}

However, Bruno may not have enough for such a large order, and may try to make up the shortfall with something else. A Character can be sure that this is indeed @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald’s Delight} by trying some of the Chancellor’s supply, and then trying some of what Bruno offers; a successful <strong>Hard (–20) Trade (Apothecary or Poisoner)</strong> or <strong>Lore (Chemistry or Medicine)</strong> Test will allow the Characters to tell whether they are the same. </p>\n<p>A character with <em>Lore (Chemistry) </em>and/or <em>Trade (Apothecary)</em> can also identify the substance as Ranald’s Delight, but this requires equipment: there is no question of setting it up in the bar, although renting a room upstairs for @Pay[4ss]{4 Schillings} for an hour would be fine with Werner, and @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno} will not object.</p>\n<p>If the question of a regular supply is raised, Bruno replies that he is always here, and can sell them up to 20 more doses, if they wait while he gets it. He leaves and returns with with a packed Middenball bag in 30–60 minutes, asking 1 GC per dose as before, which can be reduced by haggling.</p>\n<p>The Characters may ask who buys @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald’s Delight} on a regular basis. If they give Bruno the description of @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} that they got from @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor Sparsam}, he winks knowingly but says that she is a good customer and he cannot afford to lose her. In fact, Bruno will guess that the woman is likely to fall foul of the party and stop buying from him soon: with this in mind, he aims to get some money out of the party first — 50 GCs if possible. He won’t sell her out for less than 10 GCs no matter how well the characters bribe or haggle.  For this, Bruno reveals that she visits once a week, and he expects her again on Festag night.</p>\n<h3>More Incidents</h3>\n<p>The Pit can be used as the setting for a number of small incidents, ranging from a bar-room brawl to a raid from an Elite Guard squad looking for a kidnapped VIP.

{"_id":"mzdy5QBboLSFoJRg","name":"Character Death","content":"<p>Campaigns are supposed to be an entire story, from beginning to end, featuring the Characters, right? Well, sometimes that end is a gruesome death… This is the Old World, and death is an old friend, around every corner, always ready to take you into Morr’s Realm.</p>\n<p>But the concept of Character death can be more complex than it first appears. For starters, a death can disrupt an ongoing story, or it can be disappointing to the Player whose Character has just carked it. In this section, we’re going to help you avoid these pitfalls.</p>\n<h3>Survival At A Cost</h3>\n<p>Whilst death should remain a real and present threat to Characters in<strong> WFRP</strong>, it is so unfortunately final. A Character’s death is the end of their story, and as such, is a source of drama only for those who survive. This is fine, but not as effective as the alternative: survival at a cost.</p>\n<p>GMs and Players alike should consider all of the tools available to prevent death whilst steering the story into new and challenging directions. Scars, permanent injuries and amputations, changing and traumatic @JournalEntry[Psychology]{Psychologies}, and @JournalEntry[Corruption]{Dark Deals} are all examples of evocative, Character-changing, and story-enhancing experiences. A Duellist who loses their primary arm to a stray cannonball and must now find a new way in the world is infinitely more interesting than a Duellist buried in the ground.</p>\n<h3>Embracing Character Death</h3>\n<p>There are a few instances where Character death is the most interesting thing that could happen to them. These moments should come with buy-in from the Player controlling that Character. In this case, a Player should feel empowered, if they so wish, to ignore their Fate Points, and accept that their Character’s story has come to an end. The three most obvious examples are: self-sacrifice, prophetic, and no-way-out deaths.</p>\n<h4>Self-sacrifice Deaths</h4>\n<p>When a Character has the chance to save the life of a friend by sacrificing their own, it is a pivotal moment in a Campaign. This is particularly effective if the bond between the Characters has been given emotional weight throughout the Campaign, as it represents an act that cannot be taken back. However, this is not recommended if the controlling Player still has stories they wish to tell with their Character.</p>\n<h4>Prophetic Deaths</h4>\n<p>Prophecies are everywhere in Warhammer, from the Doomings every Imperial child has delivered to them, to those whispered by seers and wizards the Old World over. If a Character is presented with a perfect moment to fulfill a prophecy which would result in them dying, it could be more thematically impactful if the Player accepts this fate. However, prophecies that prove to be wrong right at the last moment can also be sources of dramatic tension, so this can really go either way.</p>\n<h4>No-way-out Deaths</h4>\n<p>Sometimes the situation is so dire that you can’t imagine a way out. Whether your neck is on the chopping block, or a Slaaneshi cultist has a wicked blade to your throat, sometimes it’s better to accept that a Character made some wrong turns along the road of life. Often these sorts of deaths serve to tell a moral — don’t fight the law because the law will win, or don’t get into bed with the servants of She Who Thirsts. However, sometimes those morals need to be flipped on their heads to hammer home the theme — the law is corrupt and deserves to be fought! Don’t use this if you feel backed into a corner, but rather if you feel the death would be satisfying to the story. Even if there seems to be no way out, a spent Fate Point demands unusual and even impossible circumstances arising to save a Character.</p>\n<p>None of these methods work unless a Player wants them to, and ultimately, the decision is in their hands. There is a good reason why Characters have Fate Points to spend!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Heroic Death</em></h3>\n<p><em>Characters who witness a heroic death, such as through self-sacrifice, are changed forever and that memory works to embolden their spirits in times of greater peril. When a Character encounters a situation similar to the heroic death, they gain a +20 bonus to Psychology Tests as they recall the heroic deed.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Daenar, seeing the inevitability of the on-coming Greenskin charge, and the perilous situation her companions are in, decides to hold them back long enough for the rest of her party to cross a rope bridge, cut it loose, and escape. Daenar stands her ground, draws her bow, and shouts at her companions to run. Months later, surrounded by Greenskins once more, Nils, Ezra, and Adelheidi recall the bravery of their fallen comrade, and are encouraged to press on because of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Introducing New Characters</h3>\n<p>When a Character dies, either heroically or hilariously, introducing the Player’s new Character to the existing party can be difficult, especially in the middle of an adventure. Here are a few tactics you can use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hired help</strong>. The party, recognising they’re missing an important piece, goes looking for someone to fill that niche. It just so happens the right (or perhaps only) person for the job is the new Character.</li>\n<li><strong>A friend in need</strong>. A beloved NPC is brought forward and becomes a full Character. If you need that Character to fulfill additional roles in the current adventure, either substitute in a different NPC for that role, or tell that Player what functions they need them to serve, and trust them to bring their own little twist.</li>\n<li><strong>We’re all in this together</strong>. If the Characters find themselves in a perilous situation — imprisoned or enslaved by their enemies, or running through the forest fleeing from whatever killed their friend — it’s easy to put bystanders or other adventuring types in the same situation. Nothing builds unity quite like a shared enemy, after all.</li>\n<li><strong>Reinforcements</strong>. If the Characters have a patron or an organisation who have employed them for their current mission, that employer can send along some needed reinforcements to get the job done.</li>\n<li><strong>Wait until the next adventure</strong>. Sometimes there’s no good way to jump straight into a new Character. If the next adventure isn’t far off — perhaps the next session — some Players may enjoy the chance to become a co-GM and take control of the Creatures the Characters fight, or to portray some of the cast of NPCs. This kind of change can even be seen as a consolation prize, or reward of sorts for losing a Character.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Doomings With 0 Fate</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Doomed Talent really takes centre stage when a Character falls to 0 Fate Points, because it’s no longer merely a string of words, but a prophecy which should terrify every Imperial soul. When this happens, you are encouraged to take that Character’s Dooming and attempt to manifest it in the world as much as possible, through both poetic and literal means. Not only does this increase the chances of a Character dying in a manner that matches their Dooming, and therefore increasing thematic cohesion in the story, but it also serves to spotlight that Character, and drive home the dread that is ever present in the Old World.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Nils has the Dooming ‘A kiss shall end thy days,’ and has recently fallen to 0 Fate Points after a nasty encounter with a hook-handed pirate. The GM takes this opportunity to have Marina, a revolutionary that Nils has been spending a lot of time with, grow increasingly emboldened. When the two of them light the fuse on a bomb set to blow up a shrine to the Chaos God Nurgle, Marina — fearing her life is about to be cut short — kisses Nils on the lips. Nils is now terrified even more so than he was already, and has to deal with this new awkwardness… if he doesn’t explode into little gobbets first.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Interpreting A Dooming</span></h3>\n<p><em>Perhaps the greatest thing about a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Dooming} is how very vague they’re worded despite how very important they are. These simple fragments of ‘wisdom’ are intended to guide a person’s whole life, as they spell out the moment of one’s death! Furthermore, there exists a great taboo in sharing one’s Dooming with another, so what may seem natural to one person would be inexplicably odd to another.</em></p>\n<p><em>Players and Characters should feel free to interpret their Dooming in whatever way they see fit, and should be encouraged to express that interpretation in hilarious ways. For example a Character with the Dooming ‘Trust not the innocence of children, for their plans are far from sound,’ may have an inherent aversion to children, or may feel a strong need to ignore and counteract anything a child says to them. They may take the Dooming literally, and believe that if their plans are ‘far from sound’, then plans involving sounds and noises are inherently trustworthy. Or potentially, if they can’t trust innocent children, maybe they can only trust guilty children, so they encourage the children they know to commit crimes!</em></p>\n<p><em>Remember that the majority of people in the Old World are both superstitious and very very skeptical, which makes for some ridiculous interpretations. Make sure to breathe some truth into their interpretations, but also to exploit other curious (and equally ridiculous) twists of your own.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"5lgcrfb3I58JxD8Y","sort":200001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"}}}
{"_id":"n2j6nlkc2s2LcieJ","name":"The Lair of the Pawns","content":"<p>Trailing ‘Frau Kenner’ from her meeting with Sparsam will lead the party to the lair at about 11.30pm. The Characters may have entertained ideas about calling the Watch, but what they will find may make them change their minds. After a wait at the front door, ‘Frau Kenner’ will be seen to go inside a ruined house,  a cart loaded up with bits of furniture is outside. It looks like the occupants are getting ready to leave, so the Characters are going to have to act quickly. In any event, the Watch does not patrol this area of the city.</p>\n<p>The four live in the basement of the ruined house. There is no plan of the house itself, since no action takes place there. The rooms contain only dust, damp, rotten wood and debris, and possibly the odd spider or mouse. The windows are boarded up, but the back one has a 6-inch hole cut into the wood for the carrier pigeons. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test will reveal feathers caught in the wood, plus grain and droppings on the floor. </p>\n<p>The front and back doors are both locked (count as a Latch for the purposes of <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests). The back door has been rigged with a deadfall trap which drops a lump of masonry on anyone opening it (S 4, roll [[/r D10]] for hit location: 1–3 left arm; 4–6 right arm; 7–10 head).</p>\n<p>There is a trapdoor (3ft square) in the ground floor back room which is barred on the underside. The signal to open the trapdoor is two stamps, pause five seconds, two stamps. Only the four pawns know the code, so if they are all in the lair they will naturally be suspicious of anyone outside using it. Beneath the trapdoor, a set of narrow wooden steps leads down about 15  ft. Living rooms and corridors in the underground lair have a ceiling height of 9ft, and are lit with oil-burning lamps. </p>\n<h3>Basement Landing</h3>\n<p>Bare, undecorated, and only dimly lit.</p>\n<h3>Dagmar’s Chamber</h3>\n<p>@Actor[klwNbpAHe1oQ1oo6]{Dagmar} the mercenary will be here, idling away her time whittling wood or playing a game of Lonely Emperor with a pack of scuffed cards, and whistling a few off-key bars of ‘To Hunt the Manticore’. The room contains a pallet bed, a wardrobe with spare clothes (nothing unusual), a small table and two chairs, and other mundane living, drinking and eating utensils.</p>\n<h3>Hultz’s Chamber</h3>\n<p>The general decor is very similar to Dagmar’s chamber, although there are a couple of better (but hardly good) carpets on the floor and a thick fur bed-cover.</p>\n<h3>Food Store</h3>\n<p>Contains ale, wine, fruits, sweetmeats, pickles cheese, tubers, dried meat, salted fish and so on. If nothing else, the pawns eat well during their stay here.</p>\n<h3>Latrine</h3>\n<p>A vertical shaft to the sewer not far below.</p>\n<h3>Stores</h3>\n<p>Oils, spare lamps, ropes, candles, a bale of twine, lengths of wood, coils of wire, various tools, etc. Reya Ehrlich sits tied to a chair, bound and gagged. @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} has orders to ensure that @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich’s} niece remains safe and well — she is a prized asset, after all. Klaglich insists that no one speaks to her while she is kept hostage, in case they give anything away. This has put her at odds with Dagmar, who has become attached to Reya, and has been updating her on the Carnival’s events — no one likes to miss a good show. Klaglich has told the others that Reya is being held for a ransom, which is to be paid soon.</p>\n<h3>Brunhilde’s Chamber</h3>\n<p>This room is furnished with a pallet bed, large wardrobe containing clothes for Klaglich’s many aliases, table and chair, and two tatty fur rugs. Some minor items (plates, cutlery, and the like) litter the place. A dresser is piled with tubs of rouge, panstick, kohl, wigs and other makeup needed to facilitate her disguises. In one corner is a small aviary containing [[/r d10]] carrier pigeons trained to go to @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}. Careful searching reveals a small pile of ashes where past messages have been burnt. </p>\n<p>The smell of avian excrement mixed with burnt damp paper is malodorous. </p>\n<p>There is a small secret compartment underneath the bed containing one bag with @Credit[45gc SPLIT]{45 Gold Crowns}, a bag with two fancy necklace and ear-ring sets of chrysoberyl and lapis lazuli in intricate silver settings (each set 20 GCs), and a solid gold ingot worth 35 GCs. The jewellery is stolen, so if the Characters sell it in the city they could get into trouble. </p>\n<p>Also in this hidey-hole are the love-letters from High Priest @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} to the Graf ’s paramour, @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}. They are addressed to ‘Em’ and signed by ‘Big Bad Wolf.’ Academics will note that the parchment and ink are of very high quality. The contents are sentimental protestations of undying affection, poems, and so on. Finally, the code-book for @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} messages is here.</p>\n<p>Bath Chamber </p>\n<p>A wooden tub, with a pump nearby for drawing water. Soap, thread-bare towels, and a small, dirty mirror are on a table, but do not appear to have been used much.</p>\n<p>Anton’s Chamber</p>\n<p>Decor is generally the same as for any other bedroom/chambers.

{"_id":"nPuUsRMfAFe2l6Ll","name":"Upstairs, Downstairs","content":"<p>If he sees that he is being followed, @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} races up the stairs in the hall, making sure the Characters see him. If they pursue him up the stairs, he kicks over a decorative wine barrel standing on the landing and sends it crashing down towards his pursuers. Anyone standing on the stairs, or at the foot (presumably to aim a bow or crossbow), must pass an <strong>Agility</strong> Test or suffer a Damage 3 hit and gain a @Condition[Prone] Condition. The test is <strong>Difficult (–10) </strong>for those on the stairs, and <strong>Challenging (+0) </strong>for those at the foot. At the GM’s option, those on the stairs may take additional falling Damage according to where they were when struck.</p>\n<p>As the Characters are distracted by the barrel, @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} rushes back down the stairs, leaping the banister half way down (a 3-yard jump). Assuming he lands safely, he races back to the cellar and enters the sewers through the secret passage. If anyone is still able to pursue him, he turns and fires his crossbow, or simply keeps running if his pursuers are too close. If capture seems inevitable, he swallows his poison capsule as described above.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/crossbow-pistol.webp\" width=\"271\" height=\"205\" /></div>\n<h3>The House</h3>\n<p>Only brief descriptions of the rooms are given, as it is unlikely the Characters will spend much time here. Should the party choose to loot the place, it might be prudent to have a Watch patrol come to investigate — this is a well-off district, and there is, in all likelihood, a body still in the street outside. All the rooms can be illuminated by lanterns hanging from the ceiling rafters, but at present, only those ones in rooms 1, 7, 11, and 12 are lit.</p>\n<h4>1. Hallway</h4>\n<p>The hallway is opulently furnished, with hunting trophies and tapestries on the walls. A plush blue carpet covers the floor. An elaborate staircase in the south-western corner spirals upwards to a balcony that overlooks the hall. There are three tapestries here, each worth 12 GCs. The hunting trophies are not especially valuable.</p>\n<h4>2. Dining Room</h4>\n<p>This room is currently a mess. Two bodies are sprawled across the floor. The table is upturned and shattered glass lies everywhere. What must once have been an expensive wooden cabinet has been smashed in at the front; its drawers and their contents have been scattered across the room. The two bodies are those of the servants who tried to oppose @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} as he pursued Ernest. The ensuing fight succeeded in completely devastating the whole room, leaving nothing of value unbroken.</p>\n<h4>3. Lounge</h4>\n<p>This is where Klauss used to entertain his guests while they relaxed after a meal. The room has not suffered the same fate as the dining room. Several luxurious armchairs, a large decorative fireplace, and an elaborate sideboard provide grand furnishing. Four paintings hang on the walls, each worth 7 GCs, but again, looting should be discouraged.</p>\n<h4>4. Kitchen</h4>\n<p>This large room has a flight of stone stairs leading down into the cellar. Two clubs rest in a puddle of blood, evident to anyone entering the room. A successful search turns up an ornamental clasp decorated with the symbol of the Horned Rat: three crossed bones forming the shape of an inverted triangle. All three items were dropped during the scuffle between Klauss, Ernest, and the cultists, and the clasp may reveal just what the Characters are up against. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Theology or Middenheim) </strong>Test reveals the nature of the symbol and its connection to the Skaven. Even so, many Characters may believe that the Skaven are no more than a fairytale.</p>\n<h4>5. Corridor</h4>\n<p>A corridor connects the hall to the kitchen. As it is a part of the house that guests would not normally see, it is merely stone-flagged, showing none of the splendour seen elsewhere.</p>\n<h4>6. Storeroom</h4>\n<p>This is where all the food and other domestic requirements of the house are kept, under lock and key. However, when Klauss and Ernest went to investigate the sounds of the cultists breaking in, they armed themselves with clubs kept here (now to be found in the kitchen), and Klauss forgot to lock the door in his hurry. Thus, the door is slightly ajar, the keys still in the lock.</p>\n<p>Inside are several sacks of grain, stacked neatly against one wall along with many other common food items.</p>\n<p>A wooden crate marked <em>‘DANGER! EXPLOSIVES’</em> sits innocently in the corner, and contains four @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.X8WFQf0HB9yXKjdD]{Bombs}. In addition, there are two lanterns here, three spare flasks of oil, and a tinderbox. The Bombs could prove very useful to the party in the later part of the adventure, should they choose to take them.</p>\n<h4>7. Balcony</h4>\n<p>The stairs from the hallway spiral upwards to this balcony, which overlooks the hall below. The floor here is also covered in blue carpet, but there are no adornments, save for a large, decorative wine barrel on the landing.</p>\n<h4>8. Guest Chamber</h4>\n<p>Visitors to the house are normally accommodated here. A large four-poster bed is set against one wall; a set of drawers and a large wardrobe provide the other furnishings. There is nothing of real value here.</p>\n<h4>9. Servants’ Quarters</h4>\n<p>This large room contains four beds, only two of which have been occupied recently (by the servants lying dead in the dining room). The room is not as well furnished as the rest of the house, but still represents very good servants’ accommodation.</p>\n<h4>10. Corridor</h4>\n<p>This corridor separates Klauss and Ernest’s bedrooms off from the rest of the house, providing them with more privacy. As with the hall and balcony, the floor is covered with blue carpet. Two paintings hang on the walls, worth approximately 7 GCs each.</p>\n<h4>11. Master Bedroom</h4>\n<p>This is the largest bedroom in the house, and is where Klauss usually sleeps. An ornate rosewood cabinet is set against the wall opposite the four-poster bed, together with an equally ornate set of drawers and a spacious wardrobe. The drawers are all filled with personal belongings and clothes, but a successful <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test made while searching the wardrobe turns up a false bottom concealing a secret compartment that contains @Pay[28gc,25ss,300bp,SPLIT]{28 GCs, 25 shillings, and 300 pence}.</p>\n<h4>12. Ernest’s Bedroom</h4>\n<p>This isn’t quite as luxurious as the master bedroom. It is relatively sparsely furnished with a single bed, a wardrobe, and a chest of drawers.</p>\n<h4>13. The Cellar</h4>\n<p>This stone-flagged room is filled with barrels and casks containing a wide variety of fine wines and ales. A flight of stairs leads up into the kitchen in one corner; in another corner a flagstone has been lifted out of the floor, revealing the entrance to an old, long-forgotten tunnel that leads into the sewer system. This is the way @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} and company gained entrance to the house; neither Klauss nor Ernest knew of its existence. If Tavelli has already rejoined his companions, the flagstone has been replaced, and a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test is required to find the hole — assuming the searcher has a reason to suspect such a tunnel must exist (for example, having heard the grating sound of the flagstone being pulled back into place).</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/skaven-shield.webp\" width=\"287\" height=\"298\" /></div>","folder":"cgVwF73JqHGJFy4a","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Ritual","sort":300000}}}

'Eadbanger began to siege Grunwacht, the largest town in Widow's Vale.</p>\n<p>Despite being outnumbered, the assembled Ubersreik commanders decided they could not wait any longer for reinforcements from the Wallensteins and readied their troops to relieve Grunwacht.</p>\n<p>In order to make up for their numerical disadvantage, the council of war planned to split the greenskin forces by striking a small portion of the besieging army with the forces of the Jungfreuds, Bruners and Aschaffenbergs. If the greenskins decided to retaliate, they would be forced to leave behind some of their army to contain Grunwacht or risk exposing their rear to the soldiers contained in the town. This would allow the Ubersreik army to bring their entire force to bear on a single part of the greenskin's army and defeat them in detail.</p>\n<p>The initial attack went far better than expected when communication failures in the greenskin ranks left half of their formation guarding their artillery while the other half pursued the Ubersreik army and was destroyed.</p>\n<p>This success was short-lived however, as the bulk of the greenskin army began to move and the battle began in earnest.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to the Ubersreik army, the Wallensteins had not been idle. On receiving von Walfen's message, they sent messengers at once to Grunberg, where they knew that the Emperor Karl-Franz was currently conducting exercises with the Third Reikland State Regiment. Instead of marching their troops south to Ubersreik immediately, they readied river transportation and waited for the State Army.</p>\n<p>At Widow's Vale, the fighting was savage. While the Ubersreik forces were taking heavy losses, the greenskins were taking the worst of it. Though outnumbered, von Jungfreud's army was gradually gaining the upper hand and morale was high.</p>\n<p>When the State Army and the Wallensteins arrived at Ubersreik they were alarmed to discover that the Ubersreik army had already marched to Widow's Vale. Sailing to Traisburg, the Emperor commanded all the cavalry to disembark and ride with all haste to Grunwacht to meet with Ubersreik forces.</p>\n<p>When they arrived at Grunwacht they found the battle in progress, and fell upon the rear of the already-wavering greenskin formation. The bulk of the army was crushed between the Ubersreik anvil and the hammer of the Imperial troops, spearheaded by the Emperor astride his Griffon Deathclaw, the Reiksguard Knights and the Knights of Sturmdunkel.</p>\n<h3><img style=\"display:block;border:0px solid black;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"Images/Illustrations/book-illustrations/orc-battle.webp\" width=\"650\" height=\"171\" /></h3>\n<p>A young @JournalEntry[55LRxe4TiHVoNlo4]{Captain Gregor Schadelfaust} was given command of the soldiers tasked with relieving the siege of Grunwacht. This he did with such success that his company pursued the fleeing besiegers into the right flank of the main greenskin force, starting a mass rout which caused the Waaagh! to rapidly crumble. For this decisive action, Schadelfaust was knighted on the battlefield. When the Emperor discovered that the local von Saal line was extinct and that Widow's Vale was merely governed by the Jungfreuds, he declared that the land be given to Schadelfaust as saviour of Widow's Vale.</p>\n<h1>Disposition of Troops</h1>\n<h3>Commanders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sigismund von Jungfreud the Elder</li>\n<li>Hild von Jungfreud</li>\n<li>Rudolf von Trocheim</li>\n<li>Steirlich von Bruner</li>\n<li>Brynich von Aschaffenberg</li>\n<li>Viktor von Walfen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Company ~200 Men)</p>\n<h3>Jungfreud Army</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Jungfreud - 10 Companies</li>\n<li>Trocheim - 2 Companies</li>\n<li>Aschaffenberg - 2 Companies</li>\n<li>Bruners - 3 Companies</li>\n<li>Schluessel - 1 Company</li>\n<li>Walfen - 1 Company</li>\n<li>Hupeberg - 2 Companies</li>\n<li>Hopfberg, Bohrn, Haalstein, Falkenhayn, Lilahalle - 5 Companies</li>\n<li>Total: 26 Companies, ~5200 Men</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Waaagh!

He adds a Khazalid rune to the writ to ensure that Dwarf rangers checking the writ put the offender and their party through a gruelling, thorough, and embarrassing inspection.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Azgaraz Trading Post and Merchant Pass (Vithang Kadrin)</h3>\n<p>In an effort to limit traffic on the King&rsquo;s Highway as well as solidify King Thuringar&rsquo;s land grab, the Dwarfs built Azgaraz Trading Post within Merchant Pass. The gap&rsquo;s ridges created a natural gateway of several hundred yards. The trading post is a place where Dwarf and Imperial traders can safely conduct their business. The fortified compound houses a garrison of eight and a runescribe. All guests at the compound are expected to assist in its defence should Orcs and Goblins attack.</p>\n<p>Owned and run by the Gertunmalz Brewer Clan, the Inn of the Six Pints is located within the trading post. It provides private rooms for up to sixteen people, a dormitory which can sleep up to twelve, and a stable yard for up to six beasts and four wagons.<br />Grum Dorinsson is the current master brewer and Friga, his wife, the innkeeper and chief cook. The inn&rsquo;s main dish is roasted goat covered in a spicy mustard and turnips served with a hearty, reddish-coloured malted beer called &lsquo;Dragon Breath&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Graf von Jungfreud has sent a missive to Dwarf king Thuringar in order to apprise the Karak Dwarfs of the situation in Ubersreik and ask for the king&rsquo;s support (or failing that, neutrality). The graf&rsquo;s opponents seek to stop the correspondence. Needless to say, the Dwarfs would be less than pleased to see a fight over a letter at the trading post.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>King's Highway</h3>\n<p>Staying on the King&rsquo;s Highway or any other dwarf road is the easiest way to travel. The Dwarfs have even built sizable stone shelters every two miles. These shelters are roughly 12 feet long and 6 feet wide with three 6-foot-tall walls. Travellers are free to use these structures to camp for the night or avoid getting drenched in a sudden downpour. The waystations often attract hungry Trolls, however.</p>\n<h3>Inn of the Silver Cross</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[mIAcyK8FIDvfYFMl]{Inn of the Silver Cross - Illustration}</p>\n<p>The fortified Inn of the Silver Cross is located roughly a day&rsquo;s journey from the trading post, positioned at the crossroads of the King&rsquo;s Highway and two other dwarf roads heading to the north and west. The accommodations at the inn are roughly the same as those of the Inn of the Six Pints. The clientele are mostly Dwarf farmers who grow mountain hops and barley for brewing and wheat for making bread along the northern shores of Copper Tarn. Dwarf rangers and herders of the long-haired mountain cattle are also found stopping by the inn.<br />The taproom is run by Vikram and Karga Svensson of the Gertunmalz Brewer Clan. The Svenssons brew a dark-coloured, filling lager (&lsquo;Valaya&rsquo;s Cure&rsquo;) and an amber-coloured wheat beer (&lsquo;Golden Tears&rsquo;). Beef is generally the meat of choice at the inn, served with a white, fragrant hard cheese and buttered bread.<br />The grain comes from a nearby mill on River Turquoise (Ruvalk Teikal).&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Entering Karak Azgaraz</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[k334HhS52E276BGp]{Ancestor's Gate - Illustration}</p>\n<p>The main road from the Azgaraz Trading Post passes between Copper Tarn and Eyrie Peak before continuing deep into the mountains, where it eventually enters Bretonnia. A side road, marked by statues of Dwarf sentries, winds its way up the mountain. Watchtowers made from granite blocks are located so that the road and those travelling it are always in view by one tower or another. The road zigzags until it reaches a huge 50-foot brass gate two - thirds of the way up the western face of the mountain. Two gigantic statues of powerful Dwarfs flank the immense gate: one of Grungni and the other Grimnir. Known as the Ancestors&rsquo; Gate, the imposing gate is operated by a system of clockwork gears, only opening when the king or other royalty enter or leave the Dwarf Hold. A side-door allows less important folk to enter. This common entrance is protected by murder holes and a crack unit of guards armed with crossbows.</p>\n<h3>Skadi Scowlbrow</h3>\n<p>New arrivals are greeted in the atrium by an &lsquo;Overseer&rsquo;, an official guide who ensures that they are never left unaccompanied. Dwarfs dislike strangers prying into their aff airs- their hold has not endured for so long by being open to everyone&rsquo;s inspection.</p>\n<p>Skadi is an especially suspicious fellow, making him perfect for the job, though a very unpleasant companion.</p>"}

In order to find their way through the Undercity, Characters must state their goal. The GM should then call for a Navigation Test if the Characters are searching for a location, or a Track Test if they are following a trail. This Test is modified according to how challenging the Characters’ goal is. The deeper the Characters want to go, the colder the trail they follow is, and the less familiar they are with the route, then the harder it gets.</p>\n<p>Only one member of the party can make the Test, though others can assist. Note: The member of the party making the Test must be at the front of the group as they travel.</p>\n<p>Once the Test has been taken, the number of hazards the Characters face before achieving their goal is based on the result.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Example:</strong> Astrid, Gottri and Benni are heading to a cavern in the Lower Tunnels that they stumbled across by accident the last time they went down. They made a rudimentary map and have good equipment including ropes and lanterns. The GM decides that thetest should be a <strong>Challenging (+0) Navigation</strong> Test. Astrid has the best Navigation skill at 45, so she opts to lead the party. Astrid rolls a 60 for her Navigation test, but she benefits from Gottri and Benni lending her assistance, meaning her Navigation is effectively 65. Soshe passes the test with +0 SL — a Marginal Success. This means that the party will face 3 Hazards in the Sewers, 3 in the Upper Tunnels and 3 in the Lower Tunnels.</em></p>\n<h4>Order of Encounters</h4>\n<p>The GM decides the order in which Encounters are faced by the Characters. 50–75% of Hazards are faced during the journey into the Undercity, and the remainder faced on the way out.</p>\n<p>However, in order to reach the Upper Tunnels Characters must first navigate the sewers, and in order to reach the Lower Tunnels they must navigate the Upper Tunnels. Under-Middenheim, should Characters be mad enough to go there, is deeper still.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Example:</strong> Astrid, Gottri and Benni head down. Their goal is a cavern in the Lower Tunnels. The GM decides the journey will go along the following lines: 2 Sewer Hazards – 1 Upper Tunnel Hazard – 2 Lower Tunnel Hazards – the goal is reached – 1 Lower Tunnel Hazard – 2 Upper Tunnel Hazards – 1 Sewer Hazard –back on the streets of Middenheim.</em></p>\n<h4>Calling it off</h4>\n<p>It may be that after a damaging Hazard the party feel they have no hope of reaching their goal. If this is so they can return to thesurface. If the GM still has Hazards left to play on the party for the levels they return through, these may still be faced.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Example: </strong>Astrid, Gottri and Benni are suffering from the effects of 2 bruising Hazards and they have only reached the Upper Tunnels.</em></p>\n<p><em>They decide to turn back. The GM had planned to have them face 2 Upper Tunnel Hazards and 1 Sewer Hazard on their return journey. Feeling merciful, the GM opts to have them face only the Sewer Hazard before they reach the relative safety of the surface.</em></p>\n<h4>Marching Order</h4>\n<p>Whether it is a narrow platform on the side of a sewer culvert or the passageways of the tunnel systems, most of the Undercity is very cramped and narrow. The Characters will have to decide on a marching order. Two people may walk side by side in normal conditions, and therefore benefit from the assistance of those directly in front and behind them, if need be. Certain Hazards may affect people according to marching order.</p>\n<h4>Raina’s Patrol</h4>\n<p>Raina Müs is an important villain. It is best that the Characters get a chance to encounter her early on in their investigations.</p>\n<p>Any time the Characters decide to explore the Undercity, the GM can decide to swap out any Hazard in the Sewers or Upper Tunnels with Raina’s Sewer Jacks.</p>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:238px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:76.3693%;height:17px\">\n<h3>Example Goal</h3>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.6307%;height:17px\">\n<h3>Difficulty</h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:76.3693%;height:17px\">Explore an area of sewers within 50 yards of a manhole</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.6307%;height:17px\">Very Easy (+60)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:76.3693%;height:34px\">Explore an area of sewers within 150 yards of a manhole, find a location in the sewers they visited before, following a Skaven who just passed by.</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.6307%;height:34px\">Easy (+40)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:76.3693%;height:34px\">Follow the trail of Skaven who passed a few minutes ago, explore the sewers with a map, find an area in the Upper Tunnels they visited before.</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.6307%;height:34px\">Average (+20)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:76.3693%;height:34px\">Follow the trail of Skaven who passed a few hours ago, explore the sewers without a map, explore the Upper Tunnels with a map.</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.6307%;height:34px\">Challenging (+0)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:76.3693%;height:34px\">Follow the trail of Skaven who passed a day ago, find an area in the Lower Tunnels they visited before.</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.6307%;height:34px\">Difficult (–10)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:76.3693%;height:34px\">Find an area in the Upper Tunnels they have heard of but not visited without a map, find an entrance to the Lower Tunnels.</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.6307%;height:34px\">Hard (–20) </td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:76.3693%;height:17px\">Follow the trail of a Skaven that is trying to cover its tracks, try to find an entrance to UnderMiddenheim.</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.6307%;height:17px\">Very Hard (–30) </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Hazards</h3>\n<table style=\"width:43.9062%;height:153px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.0447%;height:17px\">SL</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.9553%;height:17px\">Hazards (per layer)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.0447%;height:17px\">+6 or more</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.9553%;height:17px\">1 Hazard total</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.0447%;height:17px\">+4 to +5</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.9553%;height:17px\">1 Hazard</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.0447%;height:17px\">+2 to +3</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.9553%;height:17px\">2 Hazards</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.0447%;height:17px\">+0 to +1</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.9553%;height:17px\">3 <span style=\"background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\">Hazards</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.0447%;height:17px\">-1 to -0</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.9553%;height:17px\">4 Hazards</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.0447%;height:17px\">-2 to -3</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.9553%;height:17px\">5 <span style=\"background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\">Hazards</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.0447%;height:17px\">-4 to -5</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.9553%;height:17px\">6 Hazards</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:31.0447%;height:17px\">-6 or less</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.9553%;height:17px\">7 <span style=\"background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\">Hazards</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-bd4f147b-7fff-cb1b-ae82-cba61275ddde\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">@RollTable[Lrw5BJ6X0cSie8IT]{Undercity Hazards - Sewers}</p>\n<p>There are two types of sewer shafts: Major and Minor.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Major sewers</strong> (shown by a heavy line on the sewer map) have two walkways, each 3ft wide, on either side of a 5ft wide effluent channel. The channel is usually some 5ft deep, and filled at least half-full with the worst Bögenhafen has to offer. The curved ceiling reaches 10ft above the walkways at its highest point. The walkways are only wide enough to allow Characters to proceed in single file.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Minor sewers</strong> (shown by a narrow line on the sewer map) are simple pipes, 5ft in diameter with a sewage flow normally about a foot deep. These are relatively easy, though smelly, to negotiate.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7460d2bd-7fff-7328-100b-e7cb6faaec93\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two types of junctions in the sewer system. Where a minor sewer flows into a major sewer, the junction is beneath the walkway and the walkway is not interrupted. Where two major sewers meet, the walkway is interrupted, requiring the Adventurers to improvise a bridge of some kind or to make a leap of 5ft to cross.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Movement in the Sewers</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is effectively no risk involved in moving along the sewers at Walking speed. Any Character moving faster must succeed with a<strong> Challenging (+0) Athletics Test</strong> (taken as a Free Action) before taking the extra Movement, or fall into the effluent.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Characters who wish to cross the effluent channel must leap or wade. Because of the cramped conditions, there is only room for a run-up if the Character runs diagonally across the effluent channel, a leap of 4 yards. If the Test is failed, the Character falls into the effluent channel.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a9b7a0c8-7fff-9001-3044-c47a872b47b0\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Characters wading in the sewage flow must take an <strong>Athletics</strong> Test before their Turn in Combat (or every minute outside Combat) in order to avoid slipping and falling over. Characters who wish to go along minor sewers must wade.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Getting Mucky</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a037f721-7fff-155c-6b86-7a7e5fa03ef5\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is quite possible that Characters will fall into, or wade through, the sewage. The sewage-drenched are subject to the @Item[muHQ9uuLKaUf1w5x]{Besmirched} condition. Only Characters shorter than 4ft run any risk of drowning if they fall in the effluent channel of a major sewer. Roping the Characters together avoids this.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Infected Wounds</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The sewers are unsanitary, to say the least. After any encounter where a Character suffers any Wound loss while in the sewers (other than those suffered from Falling) each affected Character must succeed at an <strong>Easy (+40) Endurance</strong> Test or gain a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.1hQuVFZt9QnnbWzg]{Minor Infection}; if this Test is an <em>Impressive Failure (−4 SL)</em> or worse, the Character instead suffers a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.kKccDTGzWzSXCBOb]{Festering Wound}.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Further, if a Character should suffer a Critical Wound when in the sewers, even if Critical Deflection is used (see WFRP, page 299), a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test must be attempted. On a success, the Character gains a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.1hQuVFZt9QnnbWzg]{Minor Infection}. On a failure, the Character instead develops a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.kKccDTGzWzSXCBOb]{Festering Wound}.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Diseases</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As long as the Characters stay out of the effluent, they are likely to escape the sewers without contracting something nasty.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, it is quite different should they take a dip. Exposure to the sewage comes in two forms: Wading, and Immersed. Wading is moving through the effluent, but keeping your head above the muck. Immersed means your head has gone under.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After every half an hour, or part thereof, of Wading, take an <strong>Average (+20) Endurance</strong> Test. If passed, nothing happens, beyond being rather soiled. If failed, the Wading Character contracts @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.UAwTqZ3hqNb7vq9s]{Itching Pox}.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If Immersed, take a <strong>Difficult (−10) Endurance</strong> Test. If passed, nothing beyond the horror of a sewage-dunking happens. On a <em>Marginal Failure (−0 SL)</em>, the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.UAwTqZ3hqNb7vq9s]{Itching Pox} is contracted.

{"_id":"ntwLv2mYo7DqdUuZ","name":"The Inn - La Reine Rouge","content":"<p>La Reine Rouge is a large two-storey inn adjacent to a stable. It is an impressive half-timbered building, decorated with comic friezes depicting fabulous beasts in a state of inebriation.</p>\n<p>It stands next to a wide courtyard paved with irregular flagstones.</p>\n<p>A large round well stands in the centre of the courtyard. The ground floor is taken up with a spacious barroom, a small kitchen, and cramped bedchambers for the staff. Upstairs there are five modest double rooms for visitors and a common room with a dozen straw mattresses strewn on the floor. The bar is stocked with copious quantities of cheap ale and wine, as well as a few jars of Emile’s foul schnapps.</p>\n<p>When the Characters enter the inn, they immediately become aware of raised voices from the upper floor. An elderly man is yelling, ‘<em>Take your hands off me! Let me go! It’s the only way out! The only way out!</em>’ In response a woman can be heard pleading, ‘<em>No Guillaume! Please! Don’t do it!</em>’ If the Characters investigate, they find Guillaume and Claire in an upstairs corridor, next to an open window that overlooks the sloping roof of the stable below.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Guillaume</span> is perched on a bar stool poised to jump through the window but Claire is holding him back and clinging to his arm.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Claire the Barmaid</h3>\n<p>Claire is a woman in her 30s dressed in a leather jerkin, green pantaloons, and a large white apron. She is short and stout, with close-cropped dark hair. Normally a practical person with a mischievous sense of humour, the Jabberslythe attack has left her fearful and panicked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Guillaume the Headman is prevented from jumping from the window, Claire slumps to the shattered floor, confused. If engaged in conversation, she speaks slowly, her eyes blinking repeatedly as she rubs at her suddenly throbbing temples.</p>\n<p>She does not recall much of the attack, but she knows she was terrified. If asked, she will claim it was dark when she heard a great crash outside. She went to the window to see what it was and saw a large winged creature of some kind land by the well before it lumbered about the village, screaming horrifically.</p>\n<p>Then everything became confused. She remembers nothing more.</p>\n<p>If Guillaume is not stopped, Claire is overwhelmed with a grief so deep she collapses, gasping for breath and sobs uncontrollably.</p>\n<p>If left alone for any length of time, she will follow in Guillaume’s footsteps, stepping from the inn’s upper floor, tears streaming from her horrified face.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Guillaume the Headman</h3>\n<p>Before the Jabberslythe attack Guillaume was the most respected inhabitant of Griscourt. He spent most of his time in the inn, greeting visitors and holding meetings with local farmers. He is 63 years old with sparse white locks of hair and a tremendous beer gut. He dresses rather ostentatiously for a peasant, wearing a colourful red jerkin with slashed fabric to show off the puffy white linen shirt underneath.</p>\n<p>As a youth Guillaume once escaped from La Reine Rouge after the inn caught fire. He jumped from the window and slid down the stable roof with only a twisted ankle to show for his troubles. Now he believes that repeating this feat is the only way he can escape the madness around him, but if he is left to jump he tumbles gracelessly and breaks his neck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Characters can talk Wilhelm down if they deal with him politely and patiently, but it requires a successful Difficult (−10) Charm Test.</strong></p>\n<p>Should that happen, Wilhelm collapses in wide-eyed horror, utterly appalled at what he was about to do. He begins to tremble violently and initially refuses to talk with anyone. These shakes subside after a day or so, but his hands and eyes forever twitch, moving to full spasm when Morrsleib, the Chaos Moon, is full, and he develops a significant stutter.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Wilhelm is not particularly coherent for some time. If engaged, he repeats words frequently, looks over shoulders at things that are not there, and can’t stop trembling. If pressed, he remembers little of the attack besides some crashing in the darkness outside his cottage, and an overwhelming sense of terror.</p>","folder":"R0UBIVIt0sDgEI5U","sort":175000,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

For some unknown reason, this riverside district is home to thousands of birds: pigeons nested in empty garrets, starlings and sparrows calling from gardens, and every other variety to be found in an urban setting. Birdsong gives Sudkuste a lighter, more airy ambience than the rest of the city. This is a wealthy district; the grand riverside residences house successful merchants and nobles who can afford to live close to the Imperial Palace. The most notable mansion is the Altdorf residence of the von Krieglitz family, counts of Talabheim and former Emperors.</p>\n<p>Perhaps inevitably, expatriates from Talabecland tend to settle here, representing a sizable minority from all walks of life.

Its scrubby hillsides are suitable for little other than sheep farming, though there are<br />a few vineyards around Tallerhof. The Teufel itself flows from beneath the great mountain Frugelhorn and settles in a high lake. From there it flows east and then bursts through the mountains down a spectacular gorge and on towards Ubersreik and the great Reik basin.<span style=\"font-family: WarHambody; font-size: 10pt; color: #231f20; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><br style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /></span></p>\n<p>The Grey Lady Pass road runs alongside the Teufel through the valley, until it climbs high into the mountains. This is a route through to Bretonnia. Higher, and more treacherous, and often closed in the coldest months, the Grey Lady Pass is not as busy or as famous as Axe Bite Pass further north. It has a reputation for attracting smugglers and other nefarious groups, but it is still an important trading route for the Reikland, and especially for Ubersreik.</p>\n<p>The somewhat ramshackle stronghold of <strong>Schluesselschloss</strong> sits upon the island that gives it an impressive, natural, fast-flowing moat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tallerhof is a small village and the only real settlement in the Teufeltal. Apart from being a stopover on the coach route to Bretonnia, Ubersreikers think of it merely as an outpost for shepherds and smugglers. A dwarf road splits from the Grey Lady Pass in the village and rises towards Karak Azgaraz. It is the key route for the trade between Ubersreik and the dwarf hold.</p>\n<h2>Tallerhof</h2>\n<p>Tallerhof is a village of about two hundred dwellings perched on the banks of the Teufel where the Grey Lady road meets the dwarf road. It is an austere looking place of windswept, low buildings and grey slate roofs, surrounded by a grey stone wall. Its only notable feature is an ancient iron bridge, built by the dwarfs long ago for their trade route to the Reikland. While many of the villagers are law-abiding folk, there is a heavy presence of smugglers in the settlement. Its location is perfect for smuggling dwarf goods from Karak Azgaraz or other goods to and from Bretonnia. Rumour has it that even Werner Smokkel, the village&rsquo;s mayor, used to be a smuggler. This is not true &ndash; he still is one. The village priest, Siegfried Steuer, fights against him at every turn.</p>\n<p>The Iron Bridge is the village&rsquo;s only inn. It seems to have distinct, dual roles. The lounge bar accommodates legitimate travellers, honest traders, and upright dwarfs. The saloon bar is a den of smuggling and villainy.</p>\n<h3>Werner Smokkel</h3>\n<p>The village&rsquo;s mayor is a smuggler of long standing with a finger in every pie. He has grown rich through corruption but still looks out for those he considers his own kind. He has dark, greasy, slicked back hair and wears a huge, sheepskin coat. He can sway the opinion of the village&rsquo;s smuggler community with a single word.</p>\n<h3>Father SiIegfried Steuer</h3>\n<p>In contrast to the smugglers of Tallerhof, Steuer is a staunch and loyal Imperial who always pays his taxes. (The Cult of Sigmar is actually exempt from the local taxes so he doesn&rsquo;t actually pay them, but he is a staunch supporter of the principle.) Despite the village&rsquo;s reputation and the undoubted number of smugglers there, the majority of folk are Sigmar-fearing and loyal.</p>\n<h2>Teufeltal Lake</h2>\n<p>Teufel Lake is in centre of the valley, known locally as &lsquo;Rotsee&rsquo; because of is dark-red colour. Scholars claim the Teufel picks up heavy iron deposits from the surrounding mountain ranges, but local legend claims it is the collected blood of the Dwarfs fallen to Greenskins through the millenia.</p>\n<h2>De Blanc's School</h2>\n<p>De Blanc&rsquo;s School, as the sign outside the building suggests, is a &lsquo;School for the Refinement and Education of Young Gentleladies&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>The school building is a run-down, fortified manor house that sits atop a windswept ridge commanding fine views of the whole Teufeltal. Noble and aspiring parents from the Reikland and beyond send their offspring here to be given a rounded education.</p>\n<p>The school can be seen from all around the Teufeltal so it should come to the PCs&rsquo; attention quite quickly. If they ask about it, almost anyone will be able to tell the PCs what the building is used for and probably even suggest that the girls will need rescuing.</p>\n<p>What the PCs may not realise, if they go up to evacuate the girls, is that the school is run in the Myrmidian tradition. This includes the notion that the finest quality a young lady can possess is the ability to strike a man dead with a single blow of her hat pin while still looking elegant in the latest fashions.</p>\n<h3>Philline de Blanc</h3>\n<p>Philline is a stern schoolmistress with her hair tied back in a bun and spectacles perched upon her nose. She will usually be found carrying a large book, which counts as a hand weapon and shield in her expert hands. She looks mostly harmless, but just like her girls is not to be underestimated.</p>\n<h3>Margaretha Holswig-Abenauer</h3>\n<p>Pupil and sister of Crown-Prince Wolfgang?</p>\n<h2>Grey Wolf Temple</h2>\n<p>The Grey Wolf Temple is a small fortress high up on the Grey Lady Pass. It has been there for many thousands of years, some say almost as far back as the time of Sigmar. It is there to offer hospitality in the name of Ulric to those travelling to and from Bretonnia. The Templar Knights of the Order of the Grey Wolf have manned the temple for generations. The two-dozen or so knights scout the area and keep the pass free of bandits and predators in return for a small donation from those travelling through.</p>\n<p>The knights are hardened folk, dedicated to their cause and excellent warriors. They are quite prepared to fight to their deaths to defend their temple and Ulric&rsquo;s glory; in fact, they have sworn an oath to do just that.</p>\n<h3>Cleric-Captain Ulric Krause</h3>\n<p>Krause has long grey curly hair that could be mistaken for the wolfskin he wears as part of his uniform. He is a typical Ulrican, alternately gruff and ebullient, with a love of battle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Neighbouring folk are puzzled that the entire population has not moved on to less damp climes before now, but there has been a settlement here before even Sigmar&rsquo;s time, and the people of Stromdorf have a profound sense of history and are proud of their town. They regard it as a mark of their tenacity that they survive in such an intemperate climate; however, other Reiklanders mock this outlook as proof of the townsfolks&rsquo; inbred imbecility. Stromdorf&rsquo;s inclement weather ensures few travellers tarry in the town, and hardly anyone settles there from elsewhere unless they have to. Thus, Stromdorf remains a backwater; it is an impoverished place when compared to the thriving settlements in the rest of the Reikland. It is no surprise that, like the sky that thunders above their heads, Stromdorfers are a stormy lot, quick to anger and difficult to placate. They complain bitterly about the smallest grievance, finding fault in everything except, oddly, the weather, which they habitually shrug off with heroic stoicism: &ldquo;Come now, it&rsquo;s only a bit of rain!&rdquo;</p>\n<p><br />One thing that visitors to Stromdorf may notice is that there are plenty of taverns for such a small town, and they are always brimming with folk. Also, children are almost always playing in the muddy streets , even though the constant drizzle means there is little to amuse most other locals outdoors. The high birth rate offsets the fact that many Stromdorfers end up early in Morr&rsquo;s Garden, victims of consumptive diseases caused by the wet climate. It is little wonder that outsiders tend to avoid the place.</p>","img":null,"folder":"iltPBXW0kOqlZhfA","sort":3000001,"permission":{"default":2,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

Nobody ever remembers him being young or doing any sort of work. Instead he spends his time telling stories, performing tricks and just wandering the streets.</p>\n<p>He is best described as down to earth and has little time for adults. He is fiercely protective of the neighbourhood children, and rumour has it his own son went missing from the streets years ago.</p>\n<p>On the night of the murder, he was relieving himself in a doorway when he saw two nobs arguing. One started beating the other with a stick and the other man pulled a pistol and fired at him. The man with the stick fell back and the other one pulled something from his pocket (a small ornate latch box with shot and a bag of powder). The one with the stick got up and knocked the gun from his hand, making him run away unarmed. It nearly hit old Hilda though, the shot went right through her hat.</p>\n<p>This is a description of the first fight between Mikhail and Clemons. He does not know if the second man was carrying the stick or just picked it up.</p>\n<p>This is Mikhail&rsquo;s walking stick. He can tell them Old Hilda can be found in Fishmarkt, selling her charms. If asked about the book, he remembers the man picked it up before running away.</p>\n<h3>Old Hilda</h3>\n<p>Dressed in bright colours and a shawl, Hilda is a wily old woman passing herself off as a gypsy. She does this so the lucky charms and trinkets she sells have more authenticity.

The men were arguing away and she tried to stay out of their way. One of the men (Clemons) stopped her, <em>\"gave me a real fright\"</em>, and bought a sprig of heather, which she pinned to his coat. They continued arguing and then one shouted<em> \"I won&rsquo;t let you ruin her.\"</em> When she turned, he was beating him with a stick. Then the other one pulled out a firearm <em>\"nearly took my head off&rsquo;</em>.

{"_id":"pPlp6kF9OgUD1gOs","name":"The Cave","content":"<p>Map 4  shows the underground lair of Dieter Maranaeur and his mercenary bodyguard, Kurt Schultz. The cave is some 7½ miles northeast of Maubast (marked A on Map 2). The entrance is very well hidden and effectively impossible to locate by normal searching on a small scale. However, if the party has an approximate fix on the cave (say ¼ mile radius), a line-search using the whole village will prove successful (if the villagers can be persuaded).</p>\n<p>Assuming the party locates the cave and keeps it under observation, the following facts will be revealed during the day (excluding changes due to play):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 skulls arrive at about 1:00am and 3 skulls leave shortly after.</li>\n<li>A rough-looking fighter type leaves at around dawn and returns d10–3 hours later, sometimes with some game (usually rabbit).</li>\n<li>In the early evening a wild-looking man emerges, has a stretch and a few deep breaths, and returns to the cave after taking a short walk. He is followed by a skull, which flits from tree to tree wherever the man goes. This individual looks very ragged round the edges, with matted hair and greasy stubble.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Dieter learns of individuals outside he will, if given time, use a skull to investigate. He normally has one waiting passively in the cave while the other three are out. If at any time it looks like he will be attacked the wizard will terminate control of any skulls far away and begin to assert control of skulls in the cave (but this takes time).</p>\n<p>Both Dieter and Kurt will realise the cave could become a trap and will want to act quickly. As soon as Dieter has a full complement of skulls, he will use them to initiate an attack. Once all the skulls are engaged he and Kurt will emerge and act appropriately. Only when Dieter is attempting to gain control of a skull (or is in active control of one) does he need to spend time in concentration.</p>\n<p>If subjected to a surprise attack in the cave, the two men will simply make the best of it. Dieter will again try to assert control over skulls in the cave rather than wait for skulls already under his command to return. Dieter is driven by an obsession and will fight to the bitter end. Kurt is simply a mercenary and will surrender if reduced to 2 Wounds or below.</p>\n<p>It is possible for the party to deal with the wizard without resorting to violence. If they have knowledge about Stefan’s death and can persuade Dieter they have dealt with Rocheteau then a truce might be arranged. Dieter will want proof, but will be willing to send a skull to investigate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>The Effects of Smoke</h3>\n<p>It is quite possible for the PCs to decide on using fire to drive out those in the cave. Gathering suitable material will take about 2 man-hours. If dry wood is used then people in the cave will be forced to leave after about 30 minutes. If “greenwood” is used much more smoke will be produced, forcing people to leave in 10 minutes. If they stay beyond these times, the normal rules for suffocation apply.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Cave</h2>\n<h3>A. Entrance</h3>\n<p>Two candles provide faint illumination in the passage leading into the cave. If the Characters make a</p>\n<p><strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test, they find recent footprints near the entrance.</p>\n<h3>B. Bend</h3>\n<p>The passage turns at this point, and on the south wall a skull can be seen resting on a ledge. A candle rests on the skull and has covered it with melted wax.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is a normal skull but has the spell magic alarm cast on it. A Perception Test will reveal that the footprints stay clear of the skull. The spell will activate if a creature comes within 2 yards, informing Dieter that intruders are present.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The passage opens up beyond the skull to reveal a large candle-lit cave to the right and a cloth screen ahead. Unless forewarned, Dieter and Kurt will have a torch burning in Area E and the light from this will appear under the curtain. The party may hear the men talking or snoring depending on the time of day and how cautious they have been.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>area c</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This area is used as a store of iron rations and water barrels, about 6 man-weeks worth in total. Torches, candles, etc. are also here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dieter and Kurt are self-sufficient in food and water, but Kurt still goes out hunting fresh game. A small individual could hide behind the stores but would be automatically spotted if the stores were utilised.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>area d</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>About 32 human, beastman, and ratman skulls are laid in this area in a weird pattern. The cave was the site of Chaos activity but was abandoned long ago. Depressions can be seen in the sand where 10 other skulls were laid. Some 6 inches below each depression, buried in the sand, is a small nugget of warpstone. That is, there should be. One of the depressions actually shows signs of digging and the piece of warpstone under the skull is missing, removed by Wuder Lechart about a decade ago. Altogether the 42 pieces of warpstone weigh about ½ lb.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Four of the skulls are now under Dieter’s control; the other six are in a heap to the south (the result of failed attempts to gain control). Obviously these numbers will alter if skulls are destroyed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If Dieter is trying to gain control of one of the remaining skulls, he will be found in this area.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This area is soaked with magical energy, as a Very Easy (+30%) Magical Sense Skill Test reveals. Casting Rolls made within the cave receive a +1 bonus for each 1d10 rolled.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>area e</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Behind a sackcloth curtain is the living quarters of Dieter and Kurt. A torch provides light. The only furnishings are makeshift beds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dieter and Kurt spend most of their time in here. When neither have anything to do (which is often) they play draughts. Under Dieter’s instructions Kurt is making a simple chess set from odd bits of wood. Dieter reckons that teaching Kurt chess would help time pass for another month.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When not out hunting (which he does around dawn), Kurt is busy whittling. Dieter is often resting but during the day can be found in a trance-like state as he concentrates on controlling a skull (20% chance). At night the chance of finding him controlling a skull drops to 10%.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dieter will also have a skull in here as extra protection. The skull is normally passive so it would take Dieter 1 round to establish active control, and another round to give it a new set of instructions if desired.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>dI</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>eter Maranaeur</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Approaching 30 and of medium build, Dieter is beginning to look fairly mad. He has not washed, combed, or shaved for two weeks, and his only set of clothes are creased and dirt-ridden.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Despite his appearance, Dieter is (initially) reasonably sane, apart from his obsession with ruining Maubast. However, under the influence of the cave and Stefan’s spirit, the bright wizard will become increasingly unstable as the days pass. This is reflected in the behaviour of the skulls—early on they simply frighten people, but are later used to attack and kill.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If captured (and Rocheteau is still alive) Dieter will not reveal much without being tortured. If brought face-to-face with</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Rocheteau, Dieter will fall into a mad rage and attempt to kill him. If Rocheteau has already been killed then he will be proud of his activities, claiming that it was just retribution for the death of his brother.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dieter and the Skulls</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All previous sightings were part of Dieter’s experiments. The attack on the coach was to see if Dieter could control a skull while he was away from the cave. As a result of these experiments Dieter knows most of what is described in the Bestiary. However, he does not know that a metal barrier will negate control or that a dormant skull orientates itself with respect to the cave and, having done so, will attempt to return home. Under normal circumstances Dieter would have probably investigated the source of the skulls’ power, but in his present state of mind, rational thoughts are not common.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A timetable of Dieter’s use of the skulls has already been given.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This reflects his twin desires to ruin the village and kill Rocheteau, modified by his increasing madness. As described in the Bestiary, Dieter can have up to 4 skulls under his control. These are normally deployed as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1: Stays in the cave near Dieter as a personal bodyguard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2: Flits around the north of Maubast generally waiting for Dieter to assume active control.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3: Waits and attacks travellers on the road to Lichlinberg.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4: Waits and attacks travellers on the road to Grubentreich.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If any of these are destroyed or negated Dieter may initiate control of another skull in the cave as described in the Bestiary. In running the skulls the GM should remember that only one can act intelligently at any one time (i.e., the one controlled by Dieter).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The others will blindly carry out their last instruction. Dieter is able to co-ordinate the activities of all 4 skulls either by directly controlling each in turn, or by having the three passive skulls follow the active skull.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to the events timetabled, Dieter also recalls the skulls at about midnight. Since the skulls lose their power if they’re away from the cave for too long, Dieter must replace skulls on duty with fresh ones. The flight from Maubast to the cave is 1 hour, so initially the PCs will have a 2-hour window during which no skulls are around Maubast.</p>","folder":"jsAKzmzu9XIh3Q9e","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}

If the Characters are hired by the city’s military establishment for any kind of covert activity, it will be von Genscher who is in command of the operation. He will probably deal with such Characters directly, for security reasons, and will arrange things in such a way that he can deny all knowledge and association if things go awry. </p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>All three have houses close to the @JournalEntry[asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials}. Schutzmann has an office in the Watch headquarters nearby; Schwermutt in the East Gate; and von Genscher close to the palace.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Characters may make Leadership tests in place of Charm tests if their Leadership skill is higher than their Charm skill. Schutzmann respects Dwarfs and Sigmarites, who gain a +5  Fellowship bonus when talking to him.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>The Marshals avoid politics, and are quite unaware of the intrigues behind the taxes. They are all aware of the Graf ’s withdrawal, and have recently taken to discussing matters of security with @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Baron Heinrich} rather than his father. They are unhappy about the taxes, knowing how they might weaken the city, but do not see it as their place to comment.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>The Marshals’ duty is to protect the city from military threats. Political threats are completely outside their purview. They will absolutely refuse to undertake any military action within the city, or to do anything else that smacks of a coup. This includes lending the Characters any military personnel or equipment, or granting them any military rank or authority.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>Because of their wish to avoid politics, the Marshals are only slightly acquainted with the other major NPCs, and do not cultivate relationships with them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Shrewd and able, but stingy with defence funding. Always demands very precise cost estimates. They have not met with him recently, and have not noticed any odd behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Undefeated for four years, he is a fine advertisement for the warriors of Middenheim, and always willing to help out with training troops.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Pleasant, but not a close acquaintance. Schutzmann has heard that he is ‘not reliable,’ but is unsure what that means; von Genscher likes his music; and Schwermutt recently saw him mimic the @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Knight Eternal} at a cabaret club, and rather likes the Elf.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘Princess’</strong>: She seems a nice enough girl, if a bit dim.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: They know her only by reputation, as a respectable and devoted chaperone.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: They meet with them occasionally to discuss routine security matters. High Wizard Helseher’s views are respected, and Schwermutt will commend Janna Eberhauer her as showing great promise.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: The Marshals avoid discussing religious matters: Schwermutt follows Ulric, Schutzmann follows Sigmar, and von Genscher keeps his views to himself, believing religion to be uncomfortably tied up with politics. In any case, they know almost nothing about him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ybdS4Z0pbWL8oiND]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Publicly, the Marshals know nothing of court affairs, and have no interest in gossip. Secretly, though, von Genscher’s son is having an affair with Petra Liebkosen, and Schutzmann had an improbable liaison with Emmanuelle Schlagen some years ago, which he is trying very hard to forget. If he is specifically asked about her, a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test will reveal that Schutzmann is uncomfortable with the subject, but not why.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: They all think him a fool, and know he is widely ridiculed, which reflects poorly on other military men, including themselves. They would be happy to see him gone.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Schwermutt occasionally has a drink with the Elf; they all think him honest and clever.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: No direct dealings. To Schwermutt, he seems a fair enough representative of mercantile interests, but Schutzmann has heard rumours of crooked dealings, and even a claim that Wallenstein has been involved in an illegal slave trade. Von Genscher is uncertain, but will point out that nothing was proved and no charges were brought.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: They dislike his reputation, but von Genscher has seen that @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan} seems more tranquil lately. Despite all else, the Tilean may be a good thing for the Graf 's family.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: The Marshals actively avoid the Law Lords to maintain a respectable separation between the military and judicial arms of Middenheim’s government. As far as they know, the Law Lords are men of integrity and wisdom, even if Ehrlich’s melancholy sometimes keeps him from his duties.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Watch Commander Schutzmann respects Breugal in an abstract way: he is a lackey, but a senior one, and carries out his duties with devotion and ability. General Schwermutt is secretly amused by Breugal’s dress and manners. Marshal von Genscher regards Breugal as a kind of door between him and the Graf, to be unlocked with the right forms of words and behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>The Marshals have no dealings with Mueller</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>The @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya} is a tactical asset in the defence of Middenheim. The Midden Marshals have noticed that although introverted, the priestess is resolute. </p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<h4>Watch Commander Ulrich Schutzmann</h4>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Dwarven Valley Choirs}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 4}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Final}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants and Jousting}</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>General Johann Schwermutt</h4>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{A Knight’s Midsummer Dream}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Lightsingers}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Barnumble’s Incredible Elephant Show}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants and Jousting}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Semi-Final 2}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Final}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Marshal Maximillian von Genscher</h4>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts},  @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 1}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Barnumble’s Incredible Elephant Show}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Flying Displays}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 4}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Final}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>\n<h3>The Midden Marshals at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>Individual Marshals can be encountered at the various events noted on their NPC sheets. The more martial events (the @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{champion’s challenge}, the @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur fights}, and the @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{archery tournament}) are good places to encounter one or more of them. The Characters may also come to Schutzmann’s attention, for good or ill, through their interactions with the Watch.</p>\n<p>To make a good impression, a Character must be able to talk knowledgeably about the Marshal’s particular interests and professional area. While a noteworthy performance in a combat event is a good thing, a Character that impresses the Marshals far more by noting aloud that single combat has very little to do with the tasks of keeping order, or defending the city, or fighting as part of a military unit; those who can discuss such matters intelligently, and demonstrate some relevant experience, fare much better than those who cannot.</p>\n<p>The Characters can impress @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} by helping restore order when an anti-tax riot threatens to break out; if they conclude the scheduled event @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{‘Chaos Strikes by Night’} successfully, they get to meet Schutzmann. There is a good chance that @Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Schwermutt} and @Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{von Genscher} are also in his office: Schwermutt is eager to question the Characters about possible threats to the city’s defences arising from the Skaven attack, and von Genscher is interested to know whether there is any indication of an enemy base against which he can lead the city’s forces.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: The Marshals interact only rarely with the other major NPCs, and their relations with them are formal in nature. They can vouch for the Characters in order to win them an interview with @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Sparsam}, and introduce them to @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, but that is as far as they can go. The Graf is not to be disturbed in his present infirmity; introductions to the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess,’} the ladies-at-court, and other court personages are not their place; the Law Lords, while respected, are too involved with politics for the Marshals to be comfortable knowing them too well, and the same goes for @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}.</p>","folder":"YbdT1wAfqZmWtR79","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}

He may be interested in any proof that the taxes are part of a plan to weaken the city, but requires convincing proof before he acts.</p>\n<p>Janna Eberhauer is more active socially, and can be encountered at various artistic events around the city. She is fairly approachable, especially if one or more Characters have taken the trouble to join the guild since arriving in Middenheim. She is not interested in romantic advances, but listens to any Character who speaks to her as a respected wizard. She also gives the benefit of the doubt to anyone who is brought to her by her sister @Actor[ThOmnHA3l1Slh78K]{Erina}, who is staying at the @JournalEntry[ieHrUyFz83TkBikg]{Templar’s Arms} when the scheduled event @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{‘Chaos Strikes by Night’} takes place. If the Characters can convince Janna that there is a sinister plot behind the new taxes, she reviews their evidence carefully. She takes it to Helseher, if she thinks it is sufficient to convince him to act; if not, she advises the Characters on how to proceed, whom to cultivate, and what information is needed. You should take care not to let her operate the party by remote control, though; she should be a useful source of hints rather than a skeleton key to unlock the whole adventure.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Janna can provide an introduction to @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Helseher}, but only if she thinks the party has irrefutable evidence to support their assertions. She is moderately friendly with @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen}, and may introduce the Characters to her, if she thinks the ladies-at-court can help their investigation. Both wizards can introduce the Characters to @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}, since he is a guild member, though they do not suspect him, and may be reluctant to make introductions if the Characters are openly suspicious of him.</p>","folder":"9nJ4brecw2MRO3vH","sort":800000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":800000}}}

They cross @JournalEntry[limbxI1PZjhVzBy8]{Ulricsmund}, @JournalEntry[QYipS3tpaNBDgKsN]{Geldmund} and @JournalEntry[2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt}before pulling up at a building in the Freiburg, where a third figure waits in the shadows to receive the body.</p>\n<p>The Characters can call the Watch at this stage if they wish. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Bribery</strong> or <strong>Charm </strong>Test is necessary to persuade the Watch to raid the house. If this is successful, the Watch — perhaps with the Characters close behind — discovers the body and catches the miscreants red-handed. The Characters are rewarded with @Credit[10gc SPLIT]{10 GCs} as above: this is the standing reward, and is not negotiable.</p>\n<p>Instead of calling the Watch, the Characters might decide to stake the house out, or to break in and find out what is going on. If so, the GM has to decide precisely what that is. Some possibilities follow. </p>\n<p><strong>Forbidden Research</strong>: The body is being delivered to the house of a Necromancer. The premises are guarded by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.jfMhkQGzjFWDxVOm]{Cultists}. The Necromancer herself will be alerted by sounds of combat, and will attempt to use magic to kill, and preferably reanimate, the Characters.</p>\n<p><strong>In the Name of Science</strong>: The body has been delivered to a physician or scholar, who wants it for dissection and research. The house is quiet; servants have been given the night off, and encouraged to visit relatives in other parts of the city, but a few students might be in attendance. The grave robbers lock the body in a laboratory in the basement. Other than the Grave Robbers, the housekeeper has the only key. </p>\n<p>There is an operating table in the laboratory, and shelves around the walls are stacked with limbs and organs in pickling jars. If discovered, the physician or scholar tries to buy the Characters off, starting at @Credit[10gc EACH]{10 GCs each} and bargaining upwards as the GM sees fit. Even if the Characters accept the bribe, they may still have a later encounter with a band of footpads whom the physician or scholar hires to kill them and recover the money. If the thugs fail, the increasingly paranoid dissectionist may even go so far as to hire an assassin.</p>\n<p><strong>A Quick Exit</strong>: The ‘body’ is not really dead. Someone — a cultist trying to escape from their cult, a character on the run from a gang, or anything else you care to think of — has staged their own death with the aid of a coma-inducing drug. Shortly after burial, the ‘body’ is recovered by hired grave robbers (who do not know the full story) and delivered to an alchemist or pharmacist, where the antidote is administered. The fugitive is then smuggled out of the city to begin a new life somewhere else. When the Characters break in or the Watch raids the house, they find no body, just a semi-conscious patient receiving treatment. This leaves the Characters with some fast talking to do.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>If the Characters bring the incident to a satisfactory conclusion, they should be awarded @Exp[20,Down Among the Dead Men]{20 Experience Points} each, with bonuses as usual for clever ideas and engaging roleplaying.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/morrspark.webp","folder":"KyRXwOjQ3W4XV30X","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Cameo Adventures","sort":410938}}}

If they ask around the building, everyone will recall famously that Eluharath &mdash; in his infrequent but fantastic drunken forays out of his apartment &mdash; is often seen reading poetry from his vast collection of books which &lsquo;certainly sounds Tilean &mdash; what with all them &ldquo;ia&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;occio&rsquo;s&rdquo; and what have you!&rsquo; The tenants will also mention that Eluharath&rsquo;s apartment is on the top floor, if the Characters don&rsquo;t already know that. This moment is a perfect time to punctuate the scene with Sreluc&rsquo;s yelling, if he hasn&rsquo;t already been calmed down.</p>\n<p>Eluharath Wavecrest&rsquo;s apartment is on the top floor of the tenement building and is a rats&rsquo; nest of discarded silken garments, broken china and woven glass, and other faded memories of finery. The front door is secured with a strong lock and is one of the few in the building that has seen any maintenance for the last hundred years or so.</p>\n<p>The Elf recluse knows Tilean and is willing to read the diary for the Characters if they bring it to him. However, he is unwilling to help, or even answer the door, if Sreluc and Srulem are still harassing him from outside. The Characters will need to find a way to pacify the Dwarfs if they hope to get any answers.</p>\n<p>Once inside his apartment, the Characters observe that Eluharath is utterly clueless to the current happenings outside and seems to be in a very sorry state &mdash; though not himself ill or bruised. He offers the Characters drinks and other such things, which are far beyond their budgets and pallets, but which are all served on chipped expensive crockery. Once he finally settles, he will read the diary, often chuckling to himself about the good doktor&rsquo;s witticisms and the frailties of Humans.</p>\n<p>Eventually he finds the relevant passage and blanches to an even paler shade of white. He explains that Doktor Alexandra Giliani suspected &mdash; quite emphatically, and with plenty of reasoned evidence &mdash; the presence of a Vampire that uses the crawl space in the walls to move about! Even more so, she believes it must be lairing within the building itself, which results in Eluharath exclaiming it must be in the &lsquo;veritable labyrinth that is the basement!&rsquo; Eluharath wishes the Characters the best of luck before kicking them out and barring the doors. Those listening closely can hear the Elf drawing weapons and barricading himself inside the penthouse.</p>"}

Scarce becomes Rare; Rare becomes Exotic; and Exotic herbs cannot be found at all. Herbs may be located and identified using the&nbsp;<strong>Lore (Herbs)</strong>&nbsp;Skill, but most complex preparations require the&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Herbalist)</strong>&nbsp;Skill and a suitable set of trade tools to create a useful poultice. Draughts can be brewed using the&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Apothecary)</strong>&nbsp;Skill. Correctly prepared herbal treatments, or poisons, can be administered by almost anyone and rarely require any special skill.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc1\">New Endeavour: Foraging</h3>\n<p>Rather than relying on traders to procure herbs useful for the creation of poultices and draughts, those trained in the Lore (Herbs) skill may instead search for their own raw materials. This requires access to an area of the correct terrain &mdash; see the chart above for the locality in which specific herbs can be found. You may search any locality within a day&rsquo;s travel of your current location. You may only search for Herbs that are in season. Make an&nbsp;<strong>Average (+20) Lore (Herbs)</strong>&nbsp;Test. The total SL achieved may be spent to acquire one dose of any assorted herbs found in that locality at the rates below. Any unspent SL are lost.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 18.1599%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 59.757%;\">Scarcity</th>\n<th style=\"width: 39.8647%;\">SL</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 59.757%;\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.8647%;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 59.757%;\">Scarce</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.8647%;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 59.757%;\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.8647%;\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 59.757%;\">Exotic</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.8647%;\">4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"toc2\">Infusions</h3>\n<p>While, to the lay person, the art of herbal preparations may seem to be a singular pursuit, this is not the case. Different herbs require differing preparations to extract their potential, while some herbs can simply be chewed, swallowed, or rubbed onto the skin to unlock their beneficial &mdash; or harmful &mdash; effects. Additionally, some herbs can have wildly different effects depending on how they are prepared. For example, an infusion of dried Valerian is said to neutralise the effects of an excess of alcohol, whereas the raw leaf induces mild nausea.</p>\n<p>The appropriate preparation for each herb is included in it&rsquo;s description, as is the Skill required to prepare it. Note that for any preparation with a harmful effect, the Skill&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Poisoner)</strong>&nbsp;may be used in place of other&nbsp;<strong>Trade</strong>&nbsp;Skills.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc3\">Poultices</h4>\n<p>Poultices are carefully prepared pastes, usually made by griding up plant matter and mixing it with carefully chosen oils or other liquids. These can be stored for up to a month before losing their effect, or in some cases becoming toxic. Poultices are usually applied topically, often using a bandage or other covering to prevent the patient from rubbing the treatment away. Poultices require the&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Herbalist)</strong>&nbsp;Skill to prepare.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc4\">Infusions</h4>\n<p>Infusions are essentially teas, a mix of herbs and other ingredients added to boiling water. The trick is in carefully drying the materials while preserving the herb&rsquo;s useful properties. Infusions are created using the&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Herbalist)&nbsp;</strong>Skill, and if stored correctly will last for years.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc5\">Draughts</h4>\n<p>Draughts are carefully brewed and distilled mixes of herbal ingredients, preservative fluids, and other, more arcane ingredients. They are created using the<strong>&nbsp;Trade (Apothecary)</strong>&nbsp;Skill, and a properly prepared draught in a well sealed glass vial or bottle will last for at least a year.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc6\">Raw</h4>\n<p>Raw preparations are exactly what they sound like - one simply chews, slathers on, or otherwise ingests the raw ingredient to benefit from it&rsquo;s effects. Occasionally ingredients may be cooked in some way, but this is usually to make them more palatable and has little other effect. Raw ingredients must be used while still fresh, and raw preparations rarely last more than a few days before they spoil. No special skill is required to prepare such treatments, though use of the&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Cook)&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;Trade (Poisoner)&nbsp;</strong>Skill allows a Character to disguise the taste of unpleasant ingredients, for good or ill.</p>\n<h3>Herbal Preparation Qualities</h3>\n<h4>Durable</h4>\n<p>The preparation's shelf-life is doubled for each Quality.</p>\n<h4>Fine</h4>\n<p>The preparation has a neutral or pleasing look, taste, or aroma that makes it harder to detect or less suspicious. The target suffers a -10 penalty per Quality to detect it.</p>\n<h4>Practical</h4>\n<p>Double the preparation's Duration or increase its intended effect by one increment (say, from 1 to 2 Poisoned Conditions or from +10 Intelligence to +20). Also, any Test to resist the effect suffers a -10 penalty.</p>\n<h4>Shoddy</h4>\n<p>The shelf-life of the preparation is halved, after which its properties become inert, with a 10% chance per Flaw of causing the Galloping Trots.</p>\n<h4>Ugly</h4>\n<p>The preparation has a distinctive odour, look, or taste, giving any target a +10 bonus per Flaw to detect it.</p>\n<h4>Unreliable</h4>\n<p>The preparation's effect is reduced by one increment per Flaw (so, 2 Poisoned Conditions become 1 Condition) or its Duration is halved. Also, any Test to resist the effect gains a +10 bonus.<span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Bold; font-size: 14pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Regular; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Bold; font-size: 14pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Regular; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Bold; font-size: 14pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Regular; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Bold; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Regular; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Italic; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Regular; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><br style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>"}
{"_id":"qTTTk5LWfClg0h04","name":"Criminal Coinage","content":"<p>Of course, if there is money involved there will be folk looking to take any advantage they can, including criminal options. For the Rogues in your party, two schemes concerning coins are worth knowing.</p>\n<h4>Counterfeiting</h4>\n<p>The diversity of coinage circulating the Empire means counterfeiting is rife. Reiklanders may be accustomed to seeing coins from other provinces, but are always wary of being scammed. A successful Evaluate Test will detect counterfeit coins, typically by inspecting coins for weight and hardness.</p>\n<p>Actually producing counterfeit coins is much harder. It requires an Art (Engraving) Test to carve a convincing stamping die, then a Trade (Blacksmith) Test to strike the coins, usually with the aid of an assistant. Including a higher precious metal content makes Evaluate Tests to detect counterfeits more difficult; using less than a fifth makes it much easier to spot the fake coins.</p>\n<h4>Clipping</h4>\n<p>Embezzlers can trim slivers of precious metal away from the edges of coins. This scam is called ‘clipping’ or ‘shaving’ and is practised mainly by shopkeepers or tollkeepers who have access to large quantities of other peoples’ money. Gold and silver filings are then melted down and sold to jewellers, counterfeiters, or fences. Clipped coins can be detected with the Evaluate Skill; the more of the coin that’s clipped, the easier the Test. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>The Nuln Standard</em></h3>\n<p><em>Altdorf may be the current capital of Reikland and the Empire, but coinage standards are established in the city-state of Nuln to the south. Historically, Nuln was the Empire’s capital until House Holswig-Schliestein restored the throne to Altdorf a century ago, and many imperial institutions still call that city home. The Nuln Standard only governs coin weight and metallurgy, not stamp imagery, which varies significantly across the provinces.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"BrtIycD1u7HxITud","sort":325000,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide","sort":300001}}}

Alternatively, if they’re looking for someone in the underworld with connections, Rothbert emerges from the shadows. The information broker known as Josef can also put characters in touch with Rothbert.</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>Rothbert is one of @JournalEntry[CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{‘The Man’s’} most valued lieutenants, charged with resolving problems bothering the crime lord. This includes gathering information, ensuring rivals are removed, acquiring stolen goods, or bribing officials. He rarely gets his own hands dirty, preferring to procure the services of fences, smugglers, or other ruffians to get the job done.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Rothbert lives in rooms above the Dying Manticore inn in @JournalEntry[06LuFlBESLckr28m]{Ostwald}. During the day, he moves between various establishments affiliated with @JournalEntry[CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{‘The Man’} — such as the @JournalEntry[qp2neyvPkCmid7yj]{Drowned Rat} inn or @JournalEntry[xfvpYN2PCWDGVEb7]{Pfandleiher’s Pawn Shop}. But often he can be found in any other part of the city, meeting contacts and making arrangements. In the evening, he frequents inns and taverns where he can discover interesting information and people.</p>\n<p>Given recent events, Rothbert keeps a low profile as he goes about his business. He won't announce his presence, and Characters looking for him will likely need to make an arrangement to meet in advance.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Rothbert normally gets on well with strangers — after all, any of them could prove useful in the future. But now he’s nervous that anyone could be a cultist. All Fellowship Tests are at –5 for Humans and Elves until he trusts them, which happens after three successful Tests. Dwarfs and Halflings do not suffer this penalty as the cultists he saw were all man-sized.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Rothbert has a reasonable understanding of who influences the Graf, based on scraps of gossip he’s picked up and his own educated guesswork. Assume he knows who to target for influence, explaining it to the party by moving beer tankards representing the main players around on an inn table.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Rothbert thinks that the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court} have considerable influence over the Graf; he believes the Graf can’t resist a pretty face.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Rothbert wants to keep his boss happy, so he’s working to see the tax repealed and to improve his own relationship with members of the court. But he has a more pressing goal: to find out whether the cultists are after him and, if so, what he can do to stop them. </p>\n<h3>Influence</h3>\n<p>Rothbert has never met the Graf and people like him have no influence whatsoever on his opinions.</p>\n<p>Pressure Points</p>\n<p>Rothbert is well known, but after witnessing a Purple Hand ritual he feels like a hunted man. Unbeknownst to him, the cultist did not recognise his face. But if @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} realises that Rothbert saw the ritual or is working against his plan, he will have him killed. So far, Rothbert’s natural distrust of the authorities has prevented him from approaching them with what he saw. He dare not tell @JournalEntry[CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{‘The Man’} in case someone in the organisation hears and decides to sell him out.</p>\n<h2>The Opinions Of Others</h2>\n<p>As a fixer, Rothbert has met more of the major NPCs than one might expect. Certainly he’s a criminal, but he presents as fairly respectable and moves easily in different kinds of company.</p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion: Met Sascha once when visiting a horse trader. He couldn’t quite work out why he was there, but they got on well enough.</p>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel: Sascha has been part of Rallane’s audience and the Elf has drunk with him on occasion as part of a larger group. Rallane doesn’t remember much about him, other than his face.</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone: The Chaperone would never entertain the idea of conversing with a criminal such as Rothbert. She might change her mind if she realised he knows about her nephew Bruno Kohl.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}: Rothbert has several wizardly acquaintances at the Guild, who sometimes look to ‘The Man’ and his agents to source rare or illicit spell ingredients. Eberhauer knows him, but politely ignores him in public.</p>\n<p>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}: Schlagen remembers Rothbert as someone who occasionally hung around with her old theatrical friends. She’s wary of spending time with anyone associated with that time in her life. While she enjoyed it, she’s moved on. The other Ladies at Court do not know him.</p>\n<p>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt: The Elf knows Rothbert as a casual acquaintance who can be good company and always knows a good hostelry when they need one.</p>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor: He’s worried about Rothbert and ‘The Man’, as they know some of Gotthard’s dubious practices and criminal connections. If he could find a way to neutralise them, he would.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician: He likes Rothbert, as he’s always up for a drink and he knows some interesting people.</p>\n<h3>The Other Npcs</h3>\n<p>As someone who makes a trade of knowing things, Rothbert has good insights into the NPCs and several routes to introduce the party to Middenheim’s upper echelons.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: He’s heard that the Chancellor has picked up a nasty drug habit, but doesn’t know where he’s getting his supply. Josef Pfandleiher once sourced some dodgy antiques for the Chancellor and Rothbert can use his connection to the pawnbroker to engineer an introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: Rothbert knows that he wants to get into the horse trade and met him through ‘Bolgasgrad’ Vadim, a horse trader. He likes Dieter and suspects he can be easily fleeced.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: He likes the Elf and has hung around on the periphery of a few nights out, buying the odd drink and keeping his ears open. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: He’s admired her from afar, but never got anywhere near.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: He knows that her nephew is ‘a bit of a naughty boy’ and can use this as leverage to get the party an introduction to Zimperlich, or help them arrange a diversion to get her away from the Katarina.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: ‘The Man’ and other ne’er-do-wells would pay handsomely for compromising information on Schutzmann. Otherwise, Rothbert has avoided all three of the Midden Marshals like the plague.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: He knows a crooked wizard who helped steal a few books from the Wizards Guild library on his behalf, as he had a buyer in High Priest Etelka Mueller. The wizard, a Shadowmancer called Jurgen Monilus, can introduce the party to the High Wizard for a small price. Rothbert himself won’t go, as he’s wary of wizards. He thinks they can read minds and suspects some of them could be cultists.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: When an Ulrican priest wears a wolfskin, they are expected to have killed the wolf themselves. On several occasions, Rothbert has arranged the sale of freshly killed pelts to priests who are too busy or scared to do the deed themselves. If he wants to pull in a favour and enable a meeting with Ar-Ulric, he might be able to make this work.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: He knows her from her old acting days, when she hung around with a much more disreputable crowd. Rothbert is impressed at her social climbing and bears no ill will, but if he needs to use his old connection to get the party an audience with the paramour, he will.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} – Knight Eternal</strong>: No dealings with him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: They have been occasional drinking companions whenever Allavandrel ventures to the less salubrious parts of town for entertainment. Although he won’t show it, he doesn’t like the Elf as much as Rallane, because he finds him unnervingly perceptive.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Rothbert has discovered that Wallenstein is involved in dubious dealings such as human trafficking and even worship of the Ruinous Powers. He fears that the merchant was one of the cultists he saw and Rothbert avoids discussing him until he feels completely at ease with the party.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: He caused quite a sensation when he arrived in the city — not least because his largesse attracted a great number of hangers-on. They’ve never met, but Rothbert knows exactly where to find Pavarotti on any given evening.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: He doesn’t have much interest in them — they’re cold fish and he believes that there’s not much to know about them. He does know Hultz Fleischer of Klaglich’s gang and knows that he found a decent job recently working for some cunning woman, but he has no knowledge of the link to Wasmeier.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Rothbert will be at the following events, checking out the crowd and talking with acquaintances.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Gymnasts}; @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur fights}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf ’s Champion}; @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Fire-breathers of Carroburg}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Horse Fair} (with ‘Bolgasgrad’ Vadim); @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Barnumbel’s Elephant Show}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Black Pool Illuminations}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Cup Final}</p>","folder":"hQfHL1VS2zKPRt1T","sort":700000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":700000}}}
{"_id":"rJuorWdIjMar3Kdh","name":"The Case of the Goblin Sighting","permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"DMQs1UveUtlyzPKt","sort":300001,"flags":{},"content":"<p>This part of the adventure is run when the PCs decide to investigate the warehouse by the Hook wharves in response to Captain Trenker&rsquo;s brief.</p>\n<h2>Who are the Hooks and the Fish?</h2>\n<p>They are two gangs of Dock Workers who act as informal and fraternal unions. They have a long history of rivalry with one another, and at more than one point in Altdorf&rsquo;s recent history this rivalry has erupted into riotous violence.</p>\n<h2>What has happened here?</h2>\n<p>Tarwin Fleisher, a member of the Fish gang, has stolen a goblin from a group of Tileans who were due to deliver it to the university of Altdorf. With the help of some fellow Fish he broke into the warehouse and, using a leash and goad, forced the goblin to stand amongst some crates.</p>\n<p>Karl Fuchs, the caretaker, turned up and spotted the goblin in the morning, and then ran to get help. Tarwin bound the goblin up again and fled the scene.</p>\n<p>To the delight of the Fish Karl embellished his story, claiming the encounter was much more dramatic than it was, and the Hooks have called the Watch rather than trying to deal with it themselves. This plays right into the hands of the Fish, who can mock their rivals for being cowards, point out to their customers that they have greenskins in their warehouse, and accuse them of wasting Watch time when it turns out that there is nothing there.</p>\n<p>Tarwin bludgeoned the goblin and dropped it in a sewer, he then returned to the scene of the crime to gloat as the Watch investigate the incident.</p>\n<h2>Meeting Tarwin</h2>\n<p>As the Watch arrive at the Hook wharf they will spot a group of Dockers stood a little distance from the Hook workers gathered around the warehouse. Unlike the Hooks, who seem uncomfortable and&nbsp; embarrassed on the whole, these Dockers wear beaming smiles and regularly nudge each other in order to share a whispered spiteful remark.</p>\n<p>As the PCs make their way to Hooks the ringleader of this group steps forward and declares: <em>&ldquo;Gettin&rsquo; the coppers involved over some vermin are you lads? I&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve fort big brave &lsquo;Ooks&rsquo;d be able to sort saach matters aht themselves.&rdquo;</em> He is a tall and heavily built man with a shaved head and an expression indicating a cheerfully violent disposition. He wears a large black leather coat with an intricate design of a Fish painted across the back. If the PCs talk to Tarwin he will be cooperative with them, introduce himself freely and assure them that he isn&rsquo;t the sort to make trouble. If a PC recalls that this flies in the face of his comments to the Altdorf Speiler Tarwin will laugh and say <em>&ldquo;I was just &lsquo;avin&rsquo; a laugh wiv that giggling inkie reporter creep, you gotta try an&rsquo; give &lsquo;em good copy ain&rsquo;t ya?&rdquo;</em> He will then be somewhat reticent to talk further, asked if there is a reason why he thinks Draygo a creep Tarwin will say that he has a<em> &ldquo;gurly laugh&rdquo;</em> and that he&rsquo;s always hanging about with <em>&ldquo;that runty mate of &lsquo;is&rdquo;</em>.</p>\n<h2>Meeting the Hooks</h2>\n<p>Around the warehouse is a small group of Dockers, and one of their number is an elderly man who looks as if he has had a bad scare. This is Karl Fuchs, he used to be a member of an Imperial Free Company and saw action against an Orc army, which has left him with a phobia of greenskins. He is still ashamed of having run from a goblin though, and is trying to make the encounter out to be more dramatic than it actually was. If asked what happened he will say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;I were just giving the warehouse a quick once over in the morning, right, when I heard this deep growl from behind some crates, and when I look up to see what&rsquo;s there this great big greenskin leaps out. Huge it was, but all bent over and bandy, great hands dragging on the floor, massive horned helmet balanced on it&rsquo;s ugly skull. It looked at me and roared. I thought about taking it on myself, like, but then I reckoned it would be better to get the authorities involved, after all there might be more than one.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Searching the Warehouse</h2>\n<p>If the Watch search the warehouse they find one of the following clues for each successful search test.</p>\n<p>&bull; A pile of evil-smelling dung.</p>\n<p>&bull; A sharpened stick with some green blood smeared upon it.</p>\n<p>&bull; A spattered line of green blood drops that lead to a window that has been left partly open.</p>\n<p>&bull; A scrap of black leather caught on one of the catches used to secure the window.</p>\n<p>The scrap of leather matches a part torn out of Tarwin&rsquo;s coat. Faced with this Tarwin and his cronies will beat a retreat, and try to violently resist arrest.</p>"}
{"_id":"rLOdOAfi1e4IDbw4","name":"The Emperor Wilhelm","permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"sJsgXlZiMioDgTqH","sort":100001,"flags":{},"content":"<p>The Emperor Luitpold is a luxury river liner, named after the father and predecessor of Karl-Franz I. Run by the large and powerful Hindelin Lines of Altdorf, it plies the River Talabec from Altdorf to Bechafen near the Worlds Edge Mountains. Built by the Spee boatyards in Altdorf in 2510, the Luitpold and its sister-ships the Emperor Wilhelm (Altdorf&ndash;Nuln) and the Emperor Magnus (Altdorf&ndash;Marienburg) give Hindelin Lines an unrivalled luxury fleet. The &lsquo;Imperial-class&rsquo; river liners are much favoured by wealthy merchants, those on Imperial business and the lesser nobility.</p>\n<p>The Emperor Luitpold has two passenger decks; the upper passenger deck holds eight luxury staterooms and 14 threeberth servants&rsquo; cabins, while the lower holds 16 twin-berth luxury passenger cabins. Fares are as follows.</p>\n<p>The fares cover the cabin plus three meals a day. All other services &mdash; drinks and snacks during the day, for instance &mdash; are &lsquo;extras&rsquo;, and a bill for these is presented at journey&rsquo;s end.</p>\n<p>The captain has the discretion to discount fares en route but is forbidden by company regulations to offer a discount of more than 10% on the full fare. If all passenger cabins are full, they may offer passengers any spare servants&rsquo; cabins at the servants&rsquo; fare.</p>\n<p>Passenger and servants&rsquo; cabins may be equipped with an extra folding bunk on request, but only if all other cabins of the same class are full. There is a 25% surcharge for this service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Journey</h2>\n<p>The Emperor Luitpold&rsquo;s downstream journey starts at Berghafen, a small town on the upper Talabec a few miles beyond the edge of the forest; this is the highest point on the Talabec which can be reached by large river traffic. By transferring to smaller craft and then to mules, it is possible to follow the Upper Talabec all the way to the Dwarfholds of Karak-Kadrin and Karak-Ungor.</p>\n<p>There are few regular stops along the first part of the route, mainly for fresh supplies, but the Emperor Luitpold will stop to pick up and set down passengers as required. Flagpoles are set up on wharves along the route to signal the boat to stop for passengers. Once the Emperor Luitpold reaches Talabhelm, the journey becomes more regular. The boat always stops at Ahlenhof and Schoppendorf, and often at Volgen as well.</p>\n<p>The Emperor Luitpold&rsquo;s combination of sails and oars makes it a rapid means of travel. Its 750-mile trip takes around 2 weeks downstream and 2 &frac12; weeks upstream: an average of 45 and 38 miles per day respectively.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Rules of Passage</h2>\n<p>All the laws of the Empire apply aboard the Emperor Luitpold. For legal purposes, the liner is treated as being within the jurisdiction of the legal authorities of Altdorf. There are also certain rules which passengers are expected to observe while on board:</p>\n<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> All passengers are permitted to carry one sword and one dagger while on board. All other weapons &mdash; including hand weapons other than swords, unless the passenger can plead a special case &mdash; and all armour must be handed over to the purser for safe-keeping in the liner&rsquo;s strongroom, although they are available on request if passengers want them for shore visits along the way, or in the event of the liner being attacked.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic:</strong> Spellcasting of any kind is forbidden on board without the express permission of the captain. This includes the use of magical items. In practice, this rule is difficult to enforce, but anyone openly casting spells will be reported to the captain.</p>\n<p><strong>Morality:</strong> All passengers are expected to observe &lsquo;common decency&rsquo;. Basically, this means not doing anything in public which is liable to shock, offend, embarrass or outrage one&rsquo;s fellow passengers. The captain is the final judge of such matters.</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Observance:</strong> After dinner each day, the captain leads the company and passengers in a five-minute period of prayers to Sigmar, Ulric, and Taal. Attendance is not compulsory, but those who do not take part are considered impolite (Fellowship Tests become one step more difficult when dealing with any member of the crew).</p>\n<p>Passengers are free to make any observances demanded by their particular religions, subject to the laws of the Empire, but animal sacrifice of any kind on board is banned. Passengers who flout the rules of passage will be given one warning, except in extreme cases. The captain has the power to put offenders off at the next stop, handing them over to the local authorities if Imperial laws are broken.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>A Typical Day</h2>\n<p>A day aboard the Emperor Luitpold revolves around mealtimes. Breakfast is served an hour after dawn, lunch at noon, and dinner at 7pm. Mealtimes are announced by the boat&rsquo;s stewards, who walk the length of the passenger deck ringing small handbells. Meals are served in the passenger lounge, but passengers may arrange to take some or all meals in their cabins. No charge is made for this, but a tip of at least 5/&ndash; per person per meal is customary. Between meals, the passengers are left largely to their own devices. The passenger lounge is closed for 20 minutes before and after each meal as the stewards convert it from a dining-room back to a lounge, clearing away the folding tables and so on.</p>\n<p>Light meals and water is available in the passenger lounge throughout the day, and wines and spirits are served from noon till midnight, though ales are only normally available on board if the crew has had prior notice of a Dwarf dignitary travelling, or if a paying stateroom passenger has specifically requested they be available. These are all &lsquo;extras&rsquo; and must normally be paid for at the time, although a request for an account, to be settled at the end of the trip, is seldom refused. The Emperor Luitpold has a bill of fare comparable to that of a high-class restaurant in a large Imperial city, both in range and price.</p>\n<p>During the day, various deck games are available for those who wish to play, and weapons practice and friendly duels (to first blood) are permitted on the promenade deck by prior arrangement. Those wishing to engage in friendly competition must inform the captain or purser before any fight. If the crew are not aware of any prior arrangement, they will treat the incident as a common brawl and step in to restrain the combatants.</p>\n<p>After dinner, entertainments are staged in the passenger lounge: it is common, for example, for a musician or other entertainer to work his passage in return for a reduced fare. The standard fare reduction is 50% and is not subject to negotiation. A Character wishing to strike this kind of deal must make a successful Difficult (&ndash;10) Perform or Play Test, modified as follows for each of the listed skills:</p>\n<p>You can derive modifiers for other specialisations following this pattern. Anything involving fire is banned since the Emperor Luitpold is built almost entirely of wood. Animal acts are not generally acceptable, since an unfortunate incident three years ago involving a dancing bear, and more &lsquo;refined&rsquo; arts and instruments are favoured over more &lsquo;rustic&rsquo; or &lsquo;vulgar&rsquo; entertainments. No entertainment may include material that is insulting to the Emperor, the nobility, or any of the major religions, or which is in any way &lsquo;in bad taste&rsquo; (as decided by the captain). These rules are explained to every entertainer at the outset, and any breach results in the captain disallowing part or all of an entertainer&rsquo;s discount. If an offending Character protests that he or she cannot pay the full fare, the captain hints darkly that they have contacts on the staff of the notorious Mundsen Keep debtors&rsquo; prison in Altdorf.</p>"}

{"_id":"ri289tDcFl3qOsaT","name":"News and Rumours","content":"<p>These rumours may be heard along the road, at any of the various stops along the way, or from fellow travellers. Roll a [[/r d10]] to choose randomly, or pick a rumour appropriate to the NPC in question. While rumours of strife and taxation in Middenheim serve to set the mood for the rest of this adventure, be sure to pepper in some talk of civil unrest in the Empire as well. This foreshadowing will serve you well should you carry on into <strong>The Horned Rat</strong> and <strong>Empire in Ruin</strong>, the final two chapters of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As Ostland and Talebecland stand on the brink of open war, rebellion is brewing in Middenland. The Emperor’s tolerance of mutants has angered the fierce Sons of Ulric, and now the most devout among them are seeking to drive all other priests from Middenheim, to make it Ulric’s city alone.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Emperor has summoned all his military commanders to the palace to discuss the problems in Middenheim. He has also demanded that Graf Boris Todbringer, the Elector Count of Middenheim, join him in the capital immediately.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Emperor’s infamous mutant decree is an attempt to avoid open war with Middenheim. Why, everyone knows the Beastmen of the Drakwald were once as Human as Graf Boris himself. Mutation’s spreading across the province, as though some strange influence were at work.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The rats of Middenheim’s sewers are not like any rats found in the south. Full 6 ft long, they are — and some of them stand upright, wear clothes, and talk to each other in squeaks and chitters. Middenheim’s rat catchers earn their pay, and no mistake!<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Mutants and bandits continue to attack coaches passing through the Drakwald. The major coaching companies are hiring extra guards, the Roadwardens are recruiting in Altdorf and the surrounding area, but the Emperor has failed to send troops to protect the highway. Meanwhile, streams of refugees leaving Middenheim are at the mercy of bandits and beastmen.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The followers of Ulric are becoming even more militant. Not content with persecuting honest and devout Sigmarites, now they have begun picking on the priests of every other deity — and even on the Dwarfs, who helped build Middenheim. A ruinous series of tax laws has been passed, targeting Elves, Dwarfs, wizards, and priests, in particular.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>All these new taxes can mean only one thing: the Graf is filling his coffers to hire troops and mercenaries. He may be preparing to intervene in the growing conflict between Ostland and Talebecland — or he may intend to break with the Emperor, and fortify the north banks of the Reik and the Talabec against southern aggression.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>A heresy is being bandied about, claiming that Sigmar was never a god — just a mortal hero crowned as Emperor by the high priest of Ulric. They claim that Ulric is the true god of the Empire, and Sigmarites are heretics. Tension between north and south comes and goes, but all the bad feeling seems to be coalescing around religious differences. Some Ulrican fanatics even want the north to break with the rest of the Empire and become a separate nation.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Ar-Ulric has not made any statements about the heresy or the activities of the fanatical bandits who call themselves the Sons of Ulric. He has condemned their suggestions that he consider abdicating so that one of them can take his place, of course. He has said their belief that they descend from Ulric is highly apocryphal, and he supports the Graf in outlawing their public assembly in the city, but when it comes to their persecutions of Sigmarites in Middenland he keeps his mouth shut.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The mother-in-law of the informant’s cousin is a washerwoman at Castle Reikguard. She reports catching a glimpse of Crown Prince Wolfgang, ‘<em>and he was more Wolf than Gang, if you take my meaning</em>.’</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Characters may pick up the following information in the city, either through conversation with Middenheimers or by overhearing conversations. Note: It should be credible that the NPCs in question were able to have heard whatever information they pass along. For example, no grubby local peasant knows of distant Imperial machinations, while educated merchants or guildsmen are unlikely to recount mere superstition.</p>\n<p>Some of these rumours carry on stories that the Characters may have heard during <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>. Where necessary, the GM should fill in any missing details from previous stories that the Characters somehow missed.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">The Empire</h3>\n<p>Despite their sometimes dour attitude, Middenheimers love to gossip, especially about the lax ways of anyone not from Middenland, and especially during Carnival. Roll [[/r 1d10]] or choose an appropriate rumour for each situation. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Emperor Karl-Franz’s condition has become critical. His illness has been common knowledge for some time, but now it appears that he has deteriorated. Court physicians have been working with the Magicians’ Guild, but have failed to discover the nature of his illness. And who deals with important matters of state during this crisis? No one. The discontent in the capital is increasing, and spreading through the provinces even now.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Grand Duke Gustav von Krieglitz of Talabecland has sent emissaries to the palace of Grand Prince Hals von Tasseninck of Ostland. The Duke denies the accusation about the murder of von Tasseninck’s son, Hans. He is also angered by recent attacks on his border patrols by the Prince’s soldiers.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Baron Heinrich has been sent on an important diplomatic mission. He’s off to Wolfenburg to try to talk some sense into the von Tassenincks. I heard he’s going to ask them to withdraw any suggestion that von Krieglitz harmed the Crown Prince’s son. Tricky situation, but if anyone can talk Talabecland and Ostland out of a war it’s our Heinrich.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Baumann’s Blitztruppen, an elite mercenary unit, has been recruiting new members for an unknown mission in the eastern Empire. Baumann himself left the city weeks ago. Whether this has anything to do with a sudden increase in cattle rustling, crop burning and transport disruption raids on the Ostland border, nobody is prepared to say. Local militia there have been preoccupied with the sudden increase in refugees from the mounting cycle of raid and reprisal.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Emperor’s edict forbidding the slaughter or exile of mutants in the Empire hasn’t been received well. Some villagers have been hanged for murder under the new law. Only a couple of weeks ago, villagers from the Reikland rioted after an innkeeper was convicted of murdering a guest who was found to have scales on his back.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The chief representative of the Middenland Farmers’ Association, Dietrich Hoffman, was in town the other day. He made a statement to the council forecasting gloom and doom for this year’s harvest. Apparently, the harvest reports  seem to be the same across the Empire. This year the weather is to blame: too cold in winter; too wet in spring — so they say. But then, farmers are always moaning, and nobody can remember the last time they made an accurate forecast.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Marienburg seems to be the place for traders at the moment. Business is booming, and looks set to rise further over the coming months. The port is operating at nearly full capacity, and orders for grain from Bordeleaux are at record level.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Emperor’s chain of signal towers traces a very sinister pattern on the map. A cousin of the informant’s brother-in-law works as a cleaner at a wizard’s house, and has picked up a thing or two. Something very bad will happen when they are all completed — something very bad indeed.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Wagons have been seen going into Castle Reikguard more often than usual, and in greater numbers. Crown Prince Wolfgang is clearly stockpiling vittles and munitions — he must be plotting rebellion!<br /><br /></li>\n<li>That’s just irresponsible conspiracy nonsense. Really what he must be doing is getting ready to support the Emperor in an attack on Middenland!</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wolfs-pelt.webp\" width=\"204\" height=\"204\" /></div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Middenheim</h3>\n<p>Middenheim may be an unfamiliar and sometimes odd place, but its denizens are rightly proud of it and always happy to talk about the city, its history, and people. Pick @Roll[1d13]{randomly}, or choose an appropriate rumour to be overheard about Middenheim itself.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The annual wizardly illuminations might not be so grand as they have been in years past. This Scroll Tax has been an unpopular move, and Peter Kramer, a popular Wizard who led the annual ‘Red Arrows’ flying display for years, has left the city.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Have you noticed how more Dwarven establishments seem to be closing down since the introduction of the Dwarf tax? Strange thing is, few Dwarfs have been seen leaving — either by chair-lift or the main roads. Some say they have hidden themselves away in the ancient tunnels under the city.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Have you seen how the priests of Sigmar and Ulric treat each other recently? Only the other day, a fight broke out outside the Templar’s Arms when some priests of Sigmar blamed the High Priest of Ulric for introducing the Temple Tax.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The city’s defences are not as strong as people suppose. Too much attention has been paid to the dubious benefits of magic. The Dwarfs are undermining them anyway, with all their tunnelling. At least the magicians are finally getting their due — now the military realises how little help they have been.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>If you want to earn some easy money over the coming days, take up busking. During Carnival, any fool with a fiddle and a voice can make enough to live on.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The new taxes have been introduced so that the Graf can mount a campaign against the Emperor. Apparently, the recent edict on mutants convinced Graf Boris that old Karl-Franz had gone senile at last.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>They’ll be wanting a new Law Lord soon if old Ehrlich doesn’t pull himself together. This must be his third fit of melancholy since he took office. I’m surprised Hoflich hasn’t already got rid of him. Not the most compassionate type, that Hoflich.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>There were witch hunters up from Altdorf the other week. They burned 17 people at the stake for being Chaos-worshippers and witches! Why do the Graf’s people need Southerners to do this? Aren’t they able to root out followers of Chaos themselves? The Emperor’s people don’t trust us to keep our own house in order. Those witch hunters would have been just as content burning good Ulricans, if not more so!<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Someone from the Emperor’s court was in Middenheim recently, and they brought a detachment of southern knights with them as a bodyguard. Some say it was the high priest of Sigmar — or the Grand Theogonist, begging his eminence’s pardon — come to talk to Ar-Ulric about all this religious ill-feeling that’s been brewing. They’ve gone now, and good riddance, but the Emperor would do better to forget about religion and treat us Middenlanders with more respect. Ulric was here before Sigmar — everybody knows it!<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Beastmen have been coming closer to the city. Eating the corpses dropped off the Cliff of Sighs, most likely. Some of them have even been killed in the Undercity by sewer jacks and rat catchers. They say the things all had rat heads, but who knows for sure? When the only tools you’ve got are a ratting pole and a rabid terrier everything looks like a rat.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Middenheim’s Dwarfs engineered a marvellous flying device in gratitude for the sanctuary the city afforded them for over 2500 years. Even Dwarfs respect that sort of history. A dirigible they call it, it’s like a balloon with a steam engine bolted on. Baron Heinrich graciously received it and took it straight to Ostland with him. Shame you missed the day he left, the sight of him and a small squadron of Knights Panther rising up into the air was magnificent! Of course, no sooner does he leave than these taxes come in. Now the Dwarfs want their balloon back.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>If I was the Graf I’d hire mercenaries to sort out this farce on the border. Brass Keep, you heard about it? A cohort of mutated Norsemen called the Blighters have been holed up in there since the time of Magnus the Pious. Ought to be straightforward to winkle them out, but the job got wound up in politics. The Kärzburdger family own that land and won’t allow decisive action to be taken. They say the place is cursed, and that it’s better to contain the problem rather than put an end to it. They put up a picket to starve the Blighters out. Two hundred years later the Blighters are still there, and so is the picket.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Kärzburdgers used to run things in Middenheim, but they’ve fallen a long way these last two centuries. The old Kärzburdger Graf let himself be dragged by the ear by the cult of Shallya, literally, and they’ve never lived the humiliation down. We’re blessed to have a ruler like Boris Todbringer, he’s a rock. If only he’d have more legitimate children.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/ulric.webp\" width=\"202\" height=\"243\" /></div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">For Adventurers</h3>\n<p>There is always work available for those handy with a sword, and it may be a task that is suitable for one or more of  your Characters. Note: be aware that some of these rumours may send your Characters scrabbling away from the main plot, but used carefully they can nudge your players in the right direction. Roll [[/r 1d10]] and choose randomly if you wish, but it is advisable to pick a rumour appropriate to your game.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Want to earn some extra money? Well, forget trying to sign up with the militia. After last year’s near-riot after the Snotball final, ‘Iron-Head’ Schutzmann has already hired an extra 400 men to help police the city. They say he has spent almost the entire year’s budget on Carnival Week.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Have you heard how all the Dwarfs are leaving? Well, someone’s going to keep all those tunnels checked — they’ll be crying out for soldiers who aren’t afraid of the dark, preferably short.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>If you want a taste of the high life, rumour has it that Graf Boris wants to marry his daughter off as quickly as possible (nudge, nudge).<br /><br /></li>\n<li>More Road Wardens are being hired for journeys to Marienburg, Erengrad and a few of the northern coastal villages. Things are never perfect, but the roads are getting worse by the month. Twice this month, an expected shipment of Kislevite vodka has failed to arrive.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Any experience of rat-catching? Have you noticed how fat and sleek they are at the moment? Want to know why? The Dwarfs have been storing food down those tunnels of theirs, and the rats have found it.</li>\n<li>Some very well-to-do folk are visiting Middenheim during the Carnival, and most are looking to hire guides and guards. The opportunities for money-making are good, especially since the City Watch is so strapped for cash it can’t afford extra workers.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>I’ll tell you of a quick way to earn a Crown or two. Dress up as one of the Watch and go knock on some noble’s door demanding taxes. Do it early in the morning — you’d have him giving you his daughter before he’s woken up.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Here’s a good one: some young ’uns reckon that Chancellor Sparsam is taking a cut from the new taxes and stashing it all in his house. They reckon doing it over will net five grand! They’d be lucky to net five pennies: Sparsam is such a miser any money will be locked away where Ranald himself couldn’t get at it.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>They say that Baron Stefan is actually getting better! Ulric knows what that mad ‘Doktor’ is dosing him with — still, like as not he’s simply half-dead from being crammed full of poultices. What else could be done with him?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>If you can read and write well, get a job in the Taxation Komission. They’re crying out for scribes, what with all these new taxes. Of course, the basic pay is terrible, but with all the overtime you can rake it in. Mind you, I wouldn’t tell the Dwarfs about it; they’re liable to string up anyone connected with the taxes!</li>\n</ol>","folder":"9l20ogJKAnhkPnIw","sort":450000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":450000}}}
{"_id":"ru9YEZPK1fEoiXMO","name":"Weapons","content":"<p>Weapons used across the Empire vary according to provincial preference, religious requirement, individual inclination, and trusty old tradition. Here you will find a selection of the most commonly wielded melee and ranged weapons, which are presented using the following format.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weapon Group</strong>: Each Weapon is listed by its Weapon Group. If a weapon is two-handed, it is marked (2H)</li>\n<li><strong>Price</strong>: The price for an average example of the weapon.</li>\n<li><strong>Enc</strong>: The Encumbrance for the weapon.</li>\n<li><strong>Availability</strong>: The Availability of the weapon.</li>\n<li><strong>Reach/Range</strong>: The Weapon’s length, or the range of the weapon in yards.</li>\n<li><strong>Damage</strong>: The weapon’s Damage, which is added to your SL to hit.</li>\n<li><strong>Qualities and Flaw</strong>s: Any Weapon Qualities or Flaws the weapon possesses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strength Bonus is abbreviated to SB in the weapon tables.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[BL1bpxy0ms0dEgzK]{Melee Weapons}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[zOGP7JwZ3gqQa6Qj]{Ranged Weapons}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[jX9O4T79T7r01dkc]{Ammunition}</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Hand Weapons</span></h3>\n<p><em>‘Hand Weapon’ is used to describe any of a number of basic weapons that, though different, are assumed to be effectively the same in-game, including swords, axes, hammers, maces, short spears, and more.</em></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Blackpowder Ammunition</span></h3>\n<p><em>Blunderbusses are the only weapons listed that use the Small Shot or Improvised Shot ammunition. All other Blackpowder and Engineering weapons use bullets.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Weapon Damage</h3>\n<p>Some @Table[oops]{Fumble results} or spells may damage your weapon. For each point of damage your weapon receives, reduce its Damage by –1. If the Damage is reduced to +0 (or SB +0), the weapon is mangled beyond all recognition, and now counts as an Improvised Weapon. If an Improvised Weapon is Damaged, it is considered useless for melee combat.</p>\n<p>Weapons can be fixed by appropriate Artisans for 10% of the weapon’s cost per damage point sustained. Weapons reduced to Improvised Weapons cannot be fixed. You can also repair your own weapons if you have the appropriate Trade Skill, Trade Tools and, for more than a single point of Damage, a Workshop.</p>\n<h3>Melee Weapon Groups</h3>\n<p>All melee weapons are assigned to a Weapon Group. Each Weapon Group requires a separate skill to master its use.  So, Melee (Flail) allows you to use Flails and is a separate skill from Melee (Polearm), which allows you to use Polearms. If you use a weapon from a Group where you have no Advances, you Test your Weapon Skill to hit with the weapon. While you still suffer all the weapon’s Flaws, you cannot use any of its Qualities. Some Melee Weapon Groups also have special rules.</p>\n<h4>Cavalry</h4>\n<p>Cavalry weapons are assumed to be used when mounted. When not used from horse-back, all two-handed weapons in the Cavalry Weapon Group also count as Two-Handed weapons. Single-handed Cavalry weapons are not normally used when unmounted.</p>\n<h4>Flail</h4>\n<p>Unskilled characters add the Dangerous Weapon Flaw to their Flails, and the other listed Weapon Qualities are not used.</p>\n<h4>Parry</h4>\n<p>Any one-handed weapon with the Defensive Quality can be used with Melee (Parry). When using Melee (Parry), a weapon can be used to Oppose an incoming attack without the normal –20 off-hand penalty (see @JournalEntry[NYFfUIbUfYA3tbj8]{Two-Weapon Fighting}).</p>\n<h3>Weapon Reach</h3>\n<p>The lengths of the weapons are progressively bigger as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Personal</strong>: Your legs and fists, perhaps your head, and anything attached to those.</li>\n<li><strong>Very Short</strong>: Less than a foot in length.</li>\n<li><strong>Short</strong>: Up to 2 feet in length.</li>\n<li><strong>Average</strong>: Up to 3 feet long.</li>\n<li><strong>Long</strong>: Up to 6 foot long.</li>\n<li><strong>Very Long</strong>: Up to 10 feet in length; can Engage enemies up to 4 yards away, rather than just 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Massive</strong>: Anything over 10 feet long; can Engage enemies up to 6 yards away, rather than just 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Options: Weapon Length and In-Fighting</em></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">These are simple rules for those who like to use Weapon length for more than simple description of appearance, and a possible impediment to fitting down dark tunnels.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Weapon Length</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">If your weapon is longer than your opponents’, they suffer a penalty of –10 to hit you as you find it easier to keep them at bay.</span></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">In-Fighting</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">As your Action, you can perform an Opposed Melee Test to attempt to step inside your opponent’s weapon length. The winner chooses if combat continues as normal or as ‘in-fighting’. During in-fighting, any weapon longer than Short counts as an Improvised weapon.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Ranged Weapon Groups</h3>\n<p>Ranged weapons are difficult to master. You cannot attempt a Ranged Test for a weapon you do not have the correct speciality for. So, if you know Ranged (Blackpowder), you cannot attempt a Ranged (Bow) Test. However, there are a few exceptions.</p>\n<h4>Blackpowder and Explosives</h4>\n<p>Those with Ranged (Engineering) can use Blackpowder and Explosive weapons without penalty.</p>\n<h4>Crossbows and Throwing</h4>\n<p>Crossbows and Thrown weapons are relatively simple to use. You can attempt a Ranged (Crossbow) or Ranged (Throwing) Test using your Ballistic Skill, but the weapon loses all Qualities whilst retaining its Flaws.</p>\n<h4>Engineering</h4>\n<p>All Engineering weapons can be used by characters with Ranged (Blackpowder), but the weapons lose all Weapon Qualities whilst retaining their flaws.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Range</h3>\n<p>A weapon’s range is its medium range in yards. Chapter 5: Rules presents modifiers if a weapon is at Point Blank, Short, Long, or Extreme range. Calculate ranges as follows:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Calculating Range Bands</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Point Blank = Range ÷ 10</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Short = Range ÷ 2</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Long = Range x 2</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Extreme = Range x 3</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Foundry Note: </strong><em>Click on the weapon's range in the combat tab to see a breakdown of the range bands for that weapon</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Weapon Qualities</h3>\n<p>Some weapons have specific advantages over others, which are described with Weapon Qualities.</p>\n<h4>Accurate</h4>\n<p>The weapon is accurate and easy to hit with. Gain a bonus of +10 to any Test when firing this weapon.</p>\n<h4>Blackpowder</h4>\n<p>The crack of gunfire followed by gouts of smoke and confusion can be terrifying. If you are targeted by a Blackpowder weapon, you must pass an Average (+20) Cool Test or take a Broken Condition, even if the shot misses.</p>\n<h4>Blast (Rating)</h4>\n<p>All Characters within (Rating) yards of the struck target point take SL+Weapon Damage, and suffer any Conditions the weapon inflicts.</p>\n<h4>Damaging</h4>\n<p>A Damaging weapon can use the higher score from either the units die or the SL to determine the Damage caused from a successful hit. For example, if you roll 34 in your attack Test and the target number was 52 you can choose to use the SL, which in this case is 2, or the units die result, which is 4. An Undamaging weapon can never also be Damaging (Undamaging takes precedent).</p>\n<h4>Defensive</h4>\n<p>Defensive weapons are designed to parry incoming attacks. If you are wielding such a weapon, gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Melee Test when you oppose an incoming attack.</p>\n<h4>Distract</h4>\n<p>Distracting weapons can be used to drive an opponent back due to their dangerous or whip-like natures. Instead of causing Damage, a successful attack with a Distracting weapon can force an opponent back 1 yard per SL by which you win the Opposed Test.</p>\n<h4>Entangle</h4>\n<p>Your weapon wraps around your opponents, entangling them. Any opponent successfully hit by your weapon gains the Entangled Condition with a Strength value equal to your Strength Characteristic. When Entangling an opponent, you cannot otherwise use the weapon to hit. You can end the Entangling whenever you wish.</p>\n<h4>Fast</h4>\n<p>Fast weapons are designed to strike out with such speed that parrying is not an option, leaving an opponent skewered before they can react. A wielder of a Fast weapon can choose to attack with the Fast weapon outside of the normal Initiative sequence, either striking first, last, or somewhere in between as desired. </p>\n<p>Further, all Melee Tests to defend against Fast weapons suffer a penalty of –10 if your opponent is using a weapon without the Fast Quality; other Skills defend as normal. Two opponents with Fast weapons fight in Initiative order (relative to each other) as normal. A Fast weapon may never also be Slow (Slow takes precedent).</p>\n<h4>Hack</h4>\n<p>Hacking weapons have heavy blades that can hack through armour with horrific ease. If you hit an opponent, you Damage a struck piece of armour or shield by 1 point as well as wounding the target.</p>\n<h4>Impact</h4>\n<p>Some weapons are just huge or cause terrible damage due to their weight or design. On a successful hit, add the result of the units die of the attack roll to any Damage caused by an Impact weapon. An Undamaging weapon can never also have Impact (Undamaging takes precedent).</p>\n<h4>Impale</h4>\n<p>Impale weapons can kill with a single clean blow. Impale weapons cause a Critical Hit on any number divisible by 10 (i.e.: 10, 20, 30, etc.) as well as on doubles (i.e.: 11, 22, 33) rolled equal or under an appropriate Test in combat. </p>\n<p>If the impale comes from a ranged weapon, the ammunition used has firmly lodged itself in the target’s body. Arrows and bolts require a successful Challenging (+0) Heal Test to remove — bullets require a surgeon (see the Surgery  Talent in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents). You cannot heal 1 of your Wounds for each unremoved arrow or bullet.</p>\n<h4>Penetrating</h4>\n<p>The weapon is highly effective at penetrating armour. Non-metal APs are ignored, and the first point of all other armour is ignored.</p>\n<h4>Pistol</h4>\n<p>You can use this weapon to attack in Close Combat.</p>\n<h4>Precise</h4>\n<p>The weapon is easy to get on target. Gain a bonus of +1 SL to any successful Test when attacking with this weapon.</p>\n<h4>Pummel</h4>\n<p>Pummel weapons are especially good at battering foes into submission. If you score a Head hit with a Pummel weapon, attempt an Opposed Strength/ Endurance test against the struck opponent. If you win the test, your opponent gains a Stunned Condition.</p>\n<h4>Repeater (Rating)</h4>\n<p>Your weapon holds (Rating) shots, automatically reloading after each time you fire. When you use all your shots, you must fully reload the weapon using the normal rules.</p>\n<h4>Shield (Rating)</h4>\n<p>If you use this weapon to oppose an incoming attack, you count as having (Rating) Armour Points on all locations of your body. If your weapon has a Shield Rating of 2 or higher (so: Shield 2 or Shield 3), you may also Oppose incoming missile shots in your Line of Sight.</p>\n<h4>Trap Blade</h4>\n<p>Some weapons are designed to trap other weapons, and sometimes even break them. If you score a Critical when defending against an attack from a bladed weapon you can choose to trap it instead of causing a Critical Hit.</p>\n<p>If you choose to do this, enact an Opposed Strength Test, adding your SL from the previous Melee Test. If you succeed, your opponent drops the blade as it is yanked free. If you score an Astounding Success, you not only disarm your opponent, but the force of your maneuver breaks their blade unless it has the Unbreakable quality. If you fail the Test, your opponent frees the blade and may fight on as normal.</p>\n<h4>Unbreakable</h4>\n<p>The weapon is exquisitely well-made or constructed from an especially strong material. Under almost all circumstances, this weapon will not break, corrode, or lose its edge.</p>\n<h4>Wrap</h4>\n<p>Wrap weapons typically have long chains with weights at the end, making it very difficult to parry them effectively. Melee Tests opposing an attack from a Wrap weapon suffer a penalty of –1 SL, as parried strikes wrap over the top of shields, or around blades.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Flaws</h3>\n<p>Some weapons are just difficult to use, or simply dangerous, as described with Weapon Flaws.</p>\n<h4>Dangerous</h4>\n<p>Some weapons are almost as likely to hurt you as your opponent. Any failed test including an 9 on either 10s or units die results in a Fumble (see Chapter 5: Rules for more on Fumbles).</p>\n<h4>Imprecise</h4>\n<p>Imprecise weapons are difficult to bring to bear as they are unwieldy or hard to aim. Suffer a penalty of –1 SL when using the weapon to attack. An Imprecise Weapon can never be Precise (Imprecise takes precedent).</p>\n<h4>Reload (Rating)</h4>\n<p>The weapon is slow to reload. An unloaded weapon with this flaw requires an Extended Ranged Test for the appropriate Weapon Group scoring (Rating) SL to reload. If you are interrupted while reloading, you must start again from scratch.</p>\n<h4>Slow</h4>\n<p>Slow weapons are unwieldy and heavy, making them difficult to use properly. Characters using Slow weapons always strike last in a Round, regardless of Initiative order. Further, opponents gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Test to defend against your attacks.</p>\n<h4>Tiring</h4>\n<p>The weapon is fatiguing to use or difficult to bring to bear. You only gain the benefit of the Impact and Damaging Weapon Traits on a Turn you Charge.</p>\n<h4>Undamaging</h4>\n<p>Some weapons are not very good at penetrating armour. All APs are doubled against Undamaging weapons. Further, you do not automatically inflict a minimum of 1 Wound on a successful hit in combat.</p>","folder":"BrtIycD1u7HxITud","sort":698438,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"The Consumers' Guide","sort":800001}}}

The old alliance between the Empire and Dwarfs has stood since Sigmar&rsquo;s time and ensures many Dwarf clans also reside there in tight-knit communities, some having toiled on the city&rsquo;s stonework for untold generations, though naturally their stubborn natures preclude them from ever calling Altdorf home. There is even a healthy Halﬂing population, with most earning their crusts serving fine food and better ales in Altdorf &rsquo;s hostelries, many of which are guarded by the city&rsquo;s sizeable Ogre population. Even odder creatures also call the city home, with none more fantastic than those found in the Imperial Zoo, which boasts myriad monsters and animals including the Abomination of Stirland and the Drakwald Gibberbeast, each caged and displayed for the amusement of all.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">This enormous and varied population helps secure one of Altdorf&rsquo;s more notorious traits: it is infamously smelly, known aﬀectionately, and all too accurately, as &lsquo;The Great Reek&rsquo;.

Even seemingly trivial actions of the local burgomeisters and nobles can earn their ire; but the fact that many of their protests are entirely fair does not lessen the crown&rsquo;s fervor in quashing any rebellious rabbles that may take to the streets.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Altdorf is also a renowned centre for learning. The sons and daughters of wealthy households matriculate at the University of Altdorf, often with little regard to academic ability; those with scholarly potential, but without the financial clout to match it, often find their way to the High Temple of Verena, for the Goddess of Wisdom always has space for those blessed with intellect. The famed Imperial Engineers&rsquo; School &mdash; founded by Tilean genius Leonardo da Miragliano &mdash; also lies within Altdorf &rsquo;s walls. Here some of the Empire&rsquo;s bravest, and most reckless, souls devise new and inventive methods for raining fiery death on the enemies of mankind. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the school has been rebuilt over a dozen times since it was founded.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Arguably the most significant educational institution in Altdorf is also its most mysterious: The Colleges of Magic. Founded over two centuries ago at the behest of Emperor Magnus the Pious, the colleges are guided by the principles and precepts of the elven Loremaster Teclis. The colleges are charged with training magically gifted citizens to channel their dangerous talents in the defence of the Empire. Rumours of the warping inﬂuence of the potent magical energies gathered by so many wizards living in such close proximity persist; allegedly the very streets of the capital have been twisted, and certain college buildings are believed to be hidden from all but those few blessed &mdash; or should that be cursed &mdash; with witchsight, but few believe such talk.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Standing in stark contrast to the arcane mysteries of the Colleges of Magic, and as a bulwark against any errant witches or rogue magisters, Altdorf is also the beating heart of the Cult of Sigmar. Over two-thousand five-hundred years ago, Sigmar was born, raised, and eventually crowned as first emperor within the boundaries of modern Altdorf, and fttingly the city now boasts more Sigmarite temples and holy sites than all the other cities of the Empire combined. Indeed, it is often said that one cannot throw a heretic without hitting a temple of Sigmar in the city.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</p>\n</div>","img":null,"folder":"iltPBXW0kOqlZhfA","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Settlements"}}}

Admission is by invitation only. Characters of noble stock may gain admission if they befriend a Middenheim noble — say, by purchasing a round of drinks for a whole gang of them. Alternatively, bribery may work, even for a non-noble, but it will not be cheap.</p>\n<p>In addition to the non-lethal combats, there is much attention to formalities, and any participant without @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (Nobles)} Talent stands out like a sore thumb. A gang of young nobles will probably turn on the ‘peasant,’ who is turned over to the militia without a second thought. All competitors must have their own warhorse, squire, full suit of (shining) plate armour, lance, hand weapon, and heraldic banners. The gift of a favour from a sultry and aristocratic member of the audience is also desirable.</p>\n<p>The actual jousting is fairly tame, but looks very dramatic with plate-clad jousters charging at each other on fine warhorses. The jousters continue the contest until one is forced off his or her horse: this occurs when one jouster beats the other by at least 4SL on an <strong>Opposed Melee (Polearm) Test</strong>. The lances are weakened especially to break before doing any real damage.</p>\n<h4>This event is attended by the following NPC</h4>\n<p><strong>Konigstag </strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} (4–5)</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} (4–5)</p>\n<p>@Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Johann Schwermutt} (2–3)</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} (2–4)</p>\n<p>@Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} (2–4)</p>\n<p>@Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich} (2–5)</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} (2–5)</p>\n<p><strong>Angestag</strong></p>\n<p>None</p>\n<p><strong>Festag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} (5–6)</p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulric Schutzmann} (4–5)</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} (4–5).</p>\n<p>@Actor[KZjUllCfHJl4kZ2F]{Thognar} (2–5)</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>The Illuminations (Konigstag, Angestag, Festag, 9–11:00 p.m.)</h4>\n<p>Almost every wizard in the city joins in, casting spells to form huge displays of magical light. Some wizards even fly through the display, trailing magical hues behind them. Primitive fireworks are also used (but not while any wizards are flying!), though everyone knows they’re nowhere near as good as ‘real magic.’ Most of the fireworks simply explode with lots of bright light and deafening noise, but recent advances have resulted in the spectacular ‘<em>Star-Spirals</em>’ and ‘<em>Dragon-Breaths</em>.’ During the displays, the Watch is on full alert to spot any fires that may develop in the city.</p>\n<h4>This event is attended by the following NPCs</h4>\n<p><strong>Konigstag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulric Schutzmann}</p>\n<p>@Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Maximillian von Genscher} (9–10)</p>\n<p>@Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}.</p>\n<p>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert}</p>\n<p><strong>Angestag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}</p>\n<p>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}.</p>\n<p>@Actor[KZjUllCfHJl4kZ2F]{Thognar}</p>\n<p><strong>Festag (Grand Finale)</strong>:</p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</p>\n<p>@Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Johann Schwermutt}</p>\n<p>@Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Maximillian von Genscher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}</p>\n<p>@Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen}</p>\n<p>@Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich}</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}</p>\n<p>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller}</p>\n<p>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/schedule-the-great-park.webp","folder":"1k4DLap4gvCypZLg","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Carnival Events","sort":0}}}

Her professional pride can also be used against her — should @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} decide to taunt Nastassia, she may become reckless in pursuing her rival.</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>Nastassia operates as a spy for @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Baron Heinrich} and, by extension, the Todbringers of Middenheim. She is charged with gathering intelligence, running a network of infiltrators and informants and, on occasion, the clandestine suppression of threats to the Todbringers and Middenheim.</p>\n<h3>Influence</h3>\n<p>Natassia’s role as Heinrich’s lieutenant and spy depends on her anonymity. As such, she has no direct influence on the Graf.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>When in Middenheim, Nastassia roams throughout the city — from the corridors of the palace to the dingiest taverns in the @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}. She is usually in disguise or concealing her face. Nastassia reports to @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Baron Heinrich} by pigeon, although the two meet in person at various locations around the city — including in the palace itself. If she wants to meet the party, she will find them. She lives alone in a small, neat and impersonal house in @JournalEntry[limbxI1PZjhVzBy8]{Ulricsmund}.</p>\n<p>Outside Middenheim, she can be encountered in any large town or city where political or military decisions are made. In Altdorf, she runs a spy network from a front organisation, the @JournalEntry[Salzenmund Export Company], which operates from an office in @JournalEntry[Grandmarkt].</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Nastassia is untrusting by nature, so most people suffer –5 to Fellowship Tests with her. If she decides independently that the Characters are working for the interests of the Todbringers (whether they realise it or not), they gain +5 to Fellowship Tests instead.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Nastassia makes it her business to understand who has influence on the Graf, so she has in-depth knowledge of the internal politics of the court. She is one of the few who recognises the impression that @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} has made on the Graf.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Nastassia slightly overestimates the influence of @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} on the Graf ’s decisions, in part because she has not realised how the latter’s depression has muted his faith.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Nastassia has several related goals. She believes that there’s a plot against the Graf, but wants to understand the full extent of what’s underway. Then she naturally wants to foil whatever is planned and capture or eliminate the instigator. Her personal goal is to best @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich}.</p>\n<h2>The Opinions of Others</h2>\n<p>Nastassia has maintained a careful anonymity. Few who have met her know just who it was they were speaking to. While a few might recognise her as someone they have seen about the palace, none have formed much opinion of the woman. Indeed none of the major NPCs aside from @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich Todbringer} even know her name.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>During her investigations, Nastassia has acquired a wealth of intelligence on the behaviour and secrets of the other NPCs. She can feed this to the Characters during the adventure, but be careful not to overuse her and remove the need for them to investigate themselves. She should point them in the direction of clues rather than hand out facts.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: Until recently he was a dull but dependable servant of the Graf, but now he’s a drug addict who has lost his way. Nastassia knows that ‘Frau Kenner’ is the dealer, but she doesn’t know where Sparsam meets her. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: She’s observed him closely and likes him, seeing nothing negative in his character. She sees that he plans to give up his role. She is surprised that he supports the tax and suspects the hand of Klaglich is behind this — but she hasn’t discovered the hypnotism.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: He’s not stupid enough to have proposed the tax, but doesn’t seem to mind that they’ve been introduced because he doesn’t like Dwarfs. His friendship with Emmanuelle Schlagen is interesting and it seems that he knows about her affair with Ar-Ulric.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: The Princess is more intelligent than she likes to show, but she does have a soft spot for handsome, romantic men. Other NPCs might dismiss her as foolish, but the Graf pays more attention to her opinions that most realise.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: Nastassia thinks that the Chaperone’s over-protective character is beneficial, even if she finds her annoying and small-minded. She has discovered that Zimperlich’s nephew is a drug dealer who works from the Pit, and that Zimperlich has disowned him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: She thinks that they are a competent, trustworthy bunch and has advised Heinrich accordingly. She knows that Schutzmann had a liaison with Emmanuel Schlagen in the past, which he prefers to keep quiet about.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: They’re good people and loyal to Middenheim — so it’s no surprise that they’re furious about the tax. Nastassia thinks they’re a little naive and detached from political reality.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[O1WGhtHQNazslML1]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Nastassia is a moderate Ulrican, troubled by the knowledge that the head of her cult is having an affair with the paramour. She does not support celibacy and has long favoured him as head of the cult, so she worries that if he was exposed, a more fanatical Ulrican could take his place.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ybdS4Z0pbWL8oiND]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} – the Paramour</strong>: Nastassia knows that she’s having an affair with Ar-Ulric and worries that Emmanuelle’s dominance of the priest will come to no good. </p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{The Ladies at Court}</strong>: Nastassia uses Petra as a source of information, meeting her in disguise and paying her for court gossip. She knows that Natasha worships power and has kept an eye on her.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[2aOu8k1gNO1UgasZ]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} – Knight Eternal</strong>: Nastassia can’t think of a use for Prunkvoll. If the party spend too much time with him, she can warn them not to waste their efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[685Ck5A8zUzAXGKQ]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: She realises that the Elf has no interest in politics and little influence on the Graf. But he is a useful person to know and a potential ally for Heinrich’s aims for a unified Middenheim, so she has watched his dissolute lifestyle with (misplaced) concern.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[idp5Wb1CqoKl7iev]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Nastassia has been completely taken in by Wittgenstein’s misdirection. She thinks he has reformed from a shady past and become a genuinely good person in his role in the Merchant’s Guild — even making anonymous charitable donations. She suspects that someone is trying to frame him for corruption. If you need to throw the party off Wittgenstein’s scent while the events of Power Behind the Throne unfold, Nastassia can provide them with reassurance. She will later discover the truth and chastise herself for being outplayed.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: Nastassia knows Pavarotti is trustworthy — he’s trying his best to help Stefan. In the guise of Ursula von Lupe, she met him in Miragliano during a mission abroad. She knows that, below the fun-loving surface, he’s a good man, an accomplished sea captain, and an expert hypnotist.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: There’s something up with Ehrlich — the tax isn’t the kind of thing he’d normally support and he hasn’t been seen in public for a little while. Wasmeier unsettles her, but she can’t work out why.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Working from the shadows and in disguise, Nastassia can be present incognito at any Carnival event you want, observing the party and other NPCs and providing information where you deem necessary.</p>\n<p>Nastassia — the Characters never learn her real surname — is the trusted agent of Baron @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich Todbringer}, the illegitimate son of Graf Boris. He has taken on the responsibility for many diplomatic missions since his father began to decline.  At the moment he is away in Wolfenburg on a diplomatic errand. Nastassia is keeping an eye on the city in his absence. </p>\n<h3>Using Nastassia</h3>\n<p>No one ever mentions Nastassia to the Characters, for the simple reason that nobody knows who she is, or whom she works for. She has her own home in Middenheim, and is never seen with Heinrich. Her role is simply to socialise with people on the edges of diplomatic and government circles, learning what she can and reporting back to Heinrich. A lot of her time is spent in the company of minor clerks, who are pleased to brag about their jobs to impress such an attractive woman. She has contacts and spies of her own in several major cities in the Empire, and in the Tilean City States. Nastassia is fully capable of stealing documents and undertaking other covert activities when necessary.</p>\n<p>If the Players are getting into a hopeless mess — truly hopeless, that is — Nastassia can give them some invisible help. Her role as Heinrich’s spy means that she is well placed to hear lots of minor gossip, including news on the party’s activities. Intuition tell her that something is going on, and she investigates indirectly — using the Characters as pawns, if possible — reporting any concrete information to Baron @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich}.</p>\n<p>She might prompt the Characters with helpful (and anonymous) notes, messages and so on. To keep some mysteries for the players to unravel, she does not know about the central intrigues within Middenheim: only snippets of odd behaviour connected with major NPCs. Her prompts should be used sparingly, and experience point awards should be adjusted to take account of her assistance.</p>\n<p>For example, she may know the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} and the @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Paramour} are having an affair, and the High Priest has been showing signs of anxiety<br /><br /></li>\n<li>the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} is an addict, and Brunhilde Klaglich (alias ‘Frau Kenner’) is his dealer, having bought the illicit concoction from a place called ‘the Pit’<br /><br /></li>\n<li>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} can be trusted (having met him on a visit to the Tilean City States)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>…and so on.</p>\n<p>Her help should be minimal: just enough to point the Characters in the right direction, and not so much that they stop trying and simply wait for orders. @Actor[bUILl7b6hxsVqIqu]{Nastassia} only helps if she believes that the Characters are genuinely trying to do something helpful and constructive about the problems in Middenheim. Perhaps she sits not far away from them in a tavern at some time and overhears their conversations, or rents a room next to theirs and listens through the wall. More details on @JournalEntry[sIsmnZetkg8syrS2]{Nastassia} can be found in the <strong>Power Behind the Throne Companion</strong>.</p>\n<p>Nastassia is very intelligent, highly observant, and an expert at getting other people to talk about themselves and others. She is shrewd, keeps her views to herself, and manipulates others effortlessly, without them even realising. She has travelled widely in the Old World, and can speak most dialects of Old Worlder.</p>","folder":"hQfHL1VS2zKPRt1T","sort":800000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":800000}}}

Its controller can see through its eyes, but not hear. Active control of a skull requires concentration, which is broken if the controller is disturbed in any way; the skull then switches to passive mode, and seeks to carry out the last command it was given or, at the GM’s option, return to its controller.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive</strong>: When the skull is carrying out instructions out of sight of its controller, or when its controller is in direct control of another skull, its eyes dim noticeably. When it completes its most recent orders, it becomes dormant.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormant</strong>: When a skull is not under direct control and has no orders to carry out, its eyes do not glow. It seeks to return to the cave immediately; if unable to do so, it simply orients itself to face the cave. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test while moving a captive skull permits the Characters to notice this phenomenon. If a localised source of Chaos (say, a small fragment of warpstone) is brought within five yards of a dormant skull, it orients to that instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Dead</strong>: When the skull reaches 0 Wounds or has been away from a source of Chaos (the cave, a piece of warpstone, or anything else the GM chooses) for more than 24 hours, it simply becomes a normal skull.</p>\n<h3>Tracking a Skull</h3>\n<p>Although the skulls do not travel fast, they are able to fly, which makes conventional tracking impossible. Their flight and small size allows them to lose themselves in the forest easily.</p>\n<p>The Characters cannot stumble upon @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} lair by chance — except, perhaps, through a divine miracle. The area to search is simply too big, and the cave entrance too well hidden. Inventive Characters may work out various plans to follow a skull, and again the GM must judge each on its merit. As a general rule, consider Tests made to track the skulls or look for clues to be <strong>Hard (–20)</strong>.</p>\n<p>Characters running full-tilt through the forest must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics</strong> Test each Round to avoid tripping over roots, running into low branches, and so on.

Finding a pretext for an appointment requires ingenuity: the Characters could try posing as wealthy merchants or antique dealers.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Females</strong>: +10 to all Fellowship Tests when Sparsam is under the influence, –10 when not intoxicated. Sparsam is normally timid with anyone he finds attractive.</p>\n<p><strong>Academics</strong>: Characters whose Intelligence exceeds 40 may use this instead of their Fellowship score adding the advances from any appropriate social skill. Sparsam values intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: –10 to all Fellowship Tests. Sparsam is apprehensive about their reaction to the tax changes.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Sparsam knows the political system well, but is not a good judge of people. He can be helpful to Characters in matters of protocol, explain how to reach other NPCs, and may provide a crucial pass to the Inner Palace.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Sparsam believes that @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} has no influence on Graf Boris. This is only wishful thinking.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Sparsam’s main goal is to maximise public funds: the tax changes seemed good until he saw the reactions of those affected. He would try to repeal the laws — if he were not being blackmailed (see Deadly Secret: A Powder Problem, below). He collects antiques and enjoys discussing them with other enthusiasts.</p>\n<h3>The Other Npcs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Indifferent; hardly knows him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</strong> <strong>— Minstrel</strong>: Indifferent; hardly knows him</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</strong> <strong>— ‘Princess’</strong>: When forced to interact with her he is awkward but flattering. He knows that she does not like him. Secretly he thinks she is vacuous and dull.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich}</strong> <strong>— Chaperone</strong>: Fears her malice, and worries that her gossip-mongering might create social traps for him. Their mutual detestation is irrational, but they can hardly conceal it.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: No particular personal feelings. The military always want more money, of course, and Sparsam moans about this at length.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Normally has no dealings with them, but recently had to endure the wrath of Deputy High Wizard @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} about the Scroll Tax. Having taken a dose of stimulant to fortify himself for the meeting, Sparsam made an ill-judged advance for which the enraged magician threatened to turn him into a rat. He is now terrified of her, and highly apprehensive of High Wizard @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Dislikes him. He has noticed the High Priest’s agitation, and thinks Ar-Ulric may share his addiction. Sparsam has occasional paranoid fantasies about this sort.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: Thinks she is frivolous, and knows she makes sarcastic jokes behind his back. He has been dreaming up a jewellery tax in revenge. Does not know that she is Graf Boris’s paramour, nor is he aware of her affair with Ar-Ulric.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Also frivolous. Sparsam resents their allowance from the Treasury (300 Crowns per year, though he will never disclose this). The exception is the icy @Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich}, for whom he is developing a hopeless and somewhat pathetic affection. He made intoxicated advances to @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} at a recent feast, but remembers nothing of it.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</strong> <strong>— Knight Eternal</strong>: Knows him slightly through their shared interest in antiques. Thinks he is a fool, but respects him as a symbol of strong, lawful authority. At least he isn’t frivolous.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Allavandrel has always been kind to the Chancellor, rescuing him from many painful conversations at the social functions Sparsam dreads. Sparsam is not one to express affection openly, but he is glad that the Elf is around.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Admires him for his tireless and persuasive advocacy of merchants’ interests. They have sherry now and then, and discuss trade. He regards Wallenstein as ‘a stout fellow,’ and knows nothing of his connection with the Chaos Cult of the Jade Sceptre.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Embarrassed and disturbed by his impulsive forthrightness, and thinks him ‘a thoroughly bad lot’. However, his mild fear of the man means he will not express his opinion unless certain that Pavarotti will not hear of it.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Considers all three to be ‘intelligent chaps’. Works closely with them to plan and draft laws relating to the city’s finances.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Knows Breugal by sight, but has never conversed with him. To Sparsam, Breugal is just a part of the palace furniture.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>He’s seen her in the company of the @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{Law Lords}, but has no real opinion of her and finds her a little intimidating.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch:</strong> Rather fond of her, as she petitions him gently on behalf of the poor. While he doesn’t provide much support, he enjoys her attention.</p>\n<h3>Deadly Secret: A Powder Problem</h3>\n<p>About ten months ago, the Chancellor saw Law Lord @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} inhaling a white powder. Saying it was a simple tonic, Wasmeier offered some to Sparsam, who found its effects beneficial. Wasmeier introduced him to ‘@JournalEntry[jepWFu96Qh64OlHw]{Frau Kenner}’, who has kept him supplied with it since then. Unknown to the Chancellor, the doses he received were spiced with some highly-addictive extras. When Sparsam became worried, Wasmeier waved his concerns away, saying that @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald’s Delight} was completely non-addictive unless abused. This astute reply played on Sparsam’s puritanical character, and the guilt-ridden Chancellor is now convinced that his own moral weakness created the problem.</p>\n<p>Initially in favour of the tax changes, Sparsam changed his mind at the first demonstrations, but as soon as he voiced his concerns, Frau Kenner told him that her supply depended on his continued support of the taxes. If challenged, Sparsam will either leave or have the Characters thrown out, but he will be grateful for a friendly, sympathetic ear. If questioned gently, Sparsam will eventually break down: between sobs, he expresses guilt over his addiction, and the trouble he has caused by supporting the taxes. If the Characters have not offered to do so already, Sparsam will implore them to help him.</p>\n<p>All Sparsam knows about Frau Kenner is that she visits him once a week, the next visit is due on the last day of the Carnival. He describes her as ‘about 30, 5 and a half feet tall, with long blonde hair.’ Sparsam will also inform the Characters that he gave her a pass to the Inner Palace.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Recitals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 1)}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 2)}</p>\n<h3>The Chancellor at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>Sparsam has an unfortunate addiction to @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald’s Delight}, which he must take 2–5 times each day. This makes him loud, obnoxious, and sometimes vulgar. A successful <strong>Challenging </strong>Test against <strong>Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Lore (Medicine)</strong>, or <strong>Trade (Apothecary or Poisoner)</strong> suggests that he is under the influence.</p>\n<p>The Chancellor has little interest in the Carnival, and is wary of showing his face where a Dwarf might recognise it. He has received complaints from all the groups affected by the taxes, but the Dwarfs have become increasingly angry.</p>\n<p>The Characters might come across him as he flees from a mob of Dwarf hecklers. The party might be attracted by the noise of the mob, or by the sight of the Chancellor running through the streets, dodging a barrage of rotten fruit, or worse. If the party has a Dwarf member, they may not need to wait for a mob: a Dwarf Character could decide or be convinced to attack the Chancellor, allowing the other Characters to ‘rescue’ him. If the party rescues Sparsam he is  grateful — more so if the Characters see him safely to his home or to the Palace.</p>\n<p>Sparsam can also be encountered through his interest in antiques. If the Characters know what he looks like, they could recognise him at an auction or sale. He has his eye on one particular object, but is probably bidding on others as well, to hide his interest. Bidding against the Chancellor may prove expensive, at least at first — but while rich, Sparsam is miserly, and pulls out of the sale when the bidding reaches 10% above an item’s worth (for example, at 11 GCs for something worth 10 GCs). A pleasant (and knowledgeable!) conversation on antiques might result in an invitation to view Sparsam’s collection.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: If the Characters befriend Sparsam, he may be willing to provide introductions to the @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Knight Eternal} or any of the Law Lords. An introduction to Wasmeier should be difficult to arrange, though: not only is the renegade Law Lord busy juggling his normal commitments with his evil plan, but the whole adventure could be cut short if the Characters suspect him at first sight. Sparsam can also introduce the Characters to @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}, whom he considers a ‘favourable acquaintance’ (Sparsam is not the sort to have friends) and an intelligent businessman.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/josef-sparsam.webp","folder":"YbdT1wAfqZmWtR79","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}

Your personal Ambitions should never be the same as your party Ambitions, but there is no reason they can&rsquo;t complement each other.</p>\n<p>Examples of short-term party Ambitions include:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outwitting a rival group, securing a job at their loss.</li>\n<li>Hunting down the killer of a lost party member.</li>\n<li>Impressing your patron by completely succeeding in an appointed task.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Long-term Party Ambitions&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Much like short-term party Ambitions, long-term Party Ambitions work like your personal Ambitions, and can be just as wide in scope, but are for your entire group.</p>\n<p>Examples of long-term Party Ambitions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eradicate an Empire-wide Chaos Cult.</li>\n<li>Build a castle.</li>\n<li>Become Heroes of the Empire, each earning an Imperial Cross for bravery, pinned on your chests by the Emperor himself!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Achieving your Party Ambitions</h4>\n<p>If your party achieves its short-term Ambition, each member receives +50 XP, and you can all select a new Ambition for the party at the end of the session.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your party achieves its long-term Party Ambition:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All players receive a bonus of +500 XP, and the party chooses a new long-term Ambition at the end of the session.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>As many players as wish to do so can retire their Characters&mdash; who become NPCs under the GM&rsquo;s control; those who do gain a bonus of half the XP of their current Character to spend on their next Character.</li>\n</ul>","folder":"Q0UfttGS2ZpKyqfG","sort":700001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Character"}}}

{"_id":"tsWT57JlRIqqq32T","name":"Helmgart","content":"<p>Set high in @JournalEntry[The Grey Mountains], the fortress town of Helmgart guards the border with Bretonnia from the eastern side of Axe Bite Pass. The Empire&rsquo;s relations with Bretonnia have not always been civil, and while the ramparts of Helmgart are no longer lined with aging skulls in elaborate helms, they most likely remain in the castle&rsquo;s cellars. These days, the soldiers of Helmgart are more often called upon to patrol the pass, protecting travelers and merchants from Greenskins, bandits, and other menaces.</p>\n<p>Helmgart&rsquo;s keep was carved directly out of the mountainside by Dwarfs long ago. Three tiers of stout stone walls buttress a great granite mountain, dominating the surrounding terrain and oﬀering an excellent view of the road below. Adjoining Helmgart proper, is a huge, imposing wall broken only by a single, long tunnel standing between the two, sheer mountainsides: the only route through to Bretonnia. Amongst the troops garrisoning the fortress are a number of storied regiments. Most famously, the gunners of Mackensen&rsquo;s Marauders &ndash; a Reiklander State Regiment &ndash; are well known for their deadly accuracy, a fearsome reputation perhaps aided by the lack of cover on the road below the high walls. The fortress sits at one end of the great road that leads directly to B&ouml;genhafen, and from there onto Altdorf.</p>\n<p>As guardian of the principle trade route into the Empire from Bretonnia, Helmgart is equal parts imposing citadel and bustling trade town. Here, Bretonnian merchants barter brandy, wine, fine fabrics, arms, and armor, while their Reiklander counterparts in turn funnel their province&rsquo;s goods south. The local Dwarf clans, too, trade ingots of silver, lead, and iron, along with precious pieces of Dwarf-smithed metalwork. With so many merchants and traders, the Marketplatz of Helmgart is a bustling place, rife with endless opportunities and uncounted thieves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","folder":"iltPBXW0kOqlZhfA","sort":1100001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Settlements"}}}

Originally printed in </em>White Dwarf<em> issue 98, it was reprinted in <strong>The Restless Dead</strong> for first edition and adapted for the second edition rules in <strong>Plundered Vaults</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><em>This new version forms the second chapter in the saga of the Gravelord, whom readers first encountered in <strong>Death on the Reik Companion</strong>. Like that adventure, this can be used as an optional sub-plot to enrich <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, as part of a separate ‘Gravelord’ mini-campaign, or as an adventure in its own right.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Story</h2>\n<p>After taking a humiliating revenge on @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.bUxA8zyayMarTXP7]{Father Marcus} and his monks in @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.wIbYy6PUBKFdJvPF]{‘Vengeance of the Gravelord’}, Hans Gräber moves north to settle another old grudge in a village on the way to Middenheim. Purely by coincidence, the vine-growing village of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} also lies on the Characters’ journey, and they become entangled in his plans once again.</p>\n<h3>Past and Present </h3>\n<p>The origins of the current trouble lie three years in the past. A young @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Hans Gräber}, passing through Pritzstock on his way to Altdorf and initiation as a novice monk, caught sight of the beautiful @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau}, the wife of village mayor @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} and partner in his wine business.</p>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} fell hard for the beautiful wine merchant, mistaking her polite and somewhat motherly concern in his increasingly drunken state for romantic interest. When she could no longer fend off his clumsy attentions, her husband and a few villagers stepped in and treated the besotted postulant to a cooling dip in the village pond.</p>\n<p>Utterly humiliated, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} left the village before dawn, and joined his order as planned. The pain of his humiliation never abated, and neither did the memory of the woman who (in his mind) clearly led him on just to make him the village laughing stock. Having dealt with @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.bUxA8zyayMarTXP7]{Father Marcus}, revenge on the village of Pritzstock became his next priority.</p>\n<p>In his research and wanderings, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} had begun to compile a grimoire of necromantic magic, and its contents include a strange and varied array of spells. One of them, picked up in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.o2mz58EtayxnAJNY]{Grey Mountains} from a rotting parchment whose seller claimed it had come from the time of Heinrich Kemmler himself, enchants the skulls of people and animals and turns them into flying servants and emissaries. With his usual imagination and dramatic flair, Gräber is using these simple creations to conduct a reign of terror in and around @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}.</p>\n<h3>A Matter of Time</h3>\n<p>The @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gravelord} is striking at a vulnerable time. Depending on when you set this, it is either budding time, when the vines come out of their winter dormancy and require careful tending to ensure the next harvest, or harvest time. The following text assumes that the adventure takes place at harvest time and will have to be amended slightly for the spring: in either case, there are only a few critical days to do what needs to be done, or the next harvest is ruined — and with it, @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock’s} prosperity for the next year or more. With the village cowering under a necromantic threat, time is of the essence. The atmosphere in the village becomes increasingly desperate as the days pass.</p>\n<h2>Running The Adventure</h2>\n<p>The adventure is set out as follows. After an initial encounter, the Characters arrive in the village. There is a section on Pritzstock’s main NPCs: what they do, who they are, what they know, and suggestions on how they respond to various actions and conversation. This is followed by descriptions of @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} and the cave where he has made his base, as well as the other adventurers’ camp.</p>\n<p>@Scene[9qBXM8BnsfoP9zEh]{Midddenheim Surrounds} shows the layout of the villages southwest of Middenheim. At the start of the adventure, the Characters are travelling to Middenheim by coach, along the Altdorf–Middenheim road. The woods through which the road runs are known to harbour many dangers, so coaches travel quickly and avoid stopping.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Tuning the Challenge</em></h3>\n<p><em>By the time your Characters have are on the road to Middenheim, they will have been through a lot, with experience and skills to match. Depending on your party composition, you might find some of the NPCs and creatures depicted here to be outmatched by your group.</em></p>\n<em>You will find that some of the actors have two versions</em><em>. Pick the one which will present your group with an appropriate challenge. This is something that you will have to determine for yourself to some degree. There is no 'typical' <strong>WFRP </strong>group, and so creating one size fits all encounters can be difficult. A party might be all battle-hardened Soldiers, Witch Hunters and Knights, or it might be three Halfling Pedlars and a Human Graverobber who just wanted to get to the Schaffenfest. Choose wisely, and remember that making things too easy and robbing your group of meaningful challenges to overcome is just as bad as making things too hard. After all, if you make a mistake Characters have Fate points for a reason.</em></blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/coach.webp\" width=\"633\" height=\"358\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/flying-death-skull.webp","folder":"O0HfGcMmqK25GSdm","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":-100000}}}

{"_id":"u2f8Yv3n46hgUW3w","name":"Rallane Lafarel","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/rallane-lafarel.webp\" width=\"306\" height=\"306\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>As Court Minstrel, Rallane sings and jests for @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} and his entourage, privately and at court functions. He has modest influence (1 vote).</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Rallane lives in the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{Outer Palace}, where his house is always open to visitors. He visits numerous Carnival events, and is much in demand at private functions. He may play at high-class hostelries (on a whim, or for a fee), and has been known to perform impromptu in the parks. The Characters might also find him being chased through the streets by an irate group of Dwarfs, who pelt him with garbage: they can win his gratitude by helping him out. In short, a very accessible NPC.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Females</strong>, <strong>Elves</strong>: +10 to all Fellowship Tests (+15 for a female Elf ).</p>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: –15 to all Fellowship Tests. Rallane finds them crude.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Rallane is one of the few NPCs who knows that @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} is the Graf ’s paramour. He also suspects that she is having an affair with @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}; he saw signs of a romance some six months ago, and signs of tension more recently. Initially, he put this down to guilt on the part of Ar-Ulric, but recently Rallane has sensed that all is not well at court, and he wonders if the Priest’s behaviour is connected in any way.</p>\n<p>He is puzzled about @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer’s} speeches in favour of the Dwarf Tax. If the Characters have established cordial relations with Dieter as well, he may subtly question them to find out whether they too have noticed the incongruity of Dieter liking this tax when he admires Dwarfs.</p>\n<p>Rallane has many useful contacts, and knows Middenheim very well. His intuitive feeling that something is amiss may help spur the Characters into action.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Thinks, wrongly, that @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel}, the Master of the Hunt, has influence with Graf Boris. Once, when depressed following a romantic setback, Rallane told Allavandrel that he was glad that the two of them were close to the Graf; Allavandrel chose not to depress him further by telling him the truth.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Rallane likes the Dwarf Tax, and is neutral towards the others. However, it is rumoured (especially among the city’s Dwarfs) that it was Rallane who first suggested the Dwarf Tax. Although he is too proud, and dislikes Dwarfs too much, to deny it to the Characters (at least initially), Rallane is unhappy about this, and would like to clear his name.</p>\n<p>He realises that the taxes are socially divisive and, increasingly convinced that all is not well in Middenheim, he fears that worse may be on the way. He wants to find out what is wrong and try to put it right, and he is willing to help the Characters do so.</p>\n<p>He has no purely personal goals (apart from keeping his job, which he likes), but he might easily become fond of any female Character with a half-way decent Fellowship score, and an easygoing manner.</p>\n<h3>The Other Npcs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor:</strong> Hardly knows him. Dislikes his formality, has not noticed any odd behaviour, and does not suspect his addiction.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion:</strong> Long-time friend and drinking companion. He thinks Dieter and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} make an excellent couple, but fears that their marriage might stop Dieter carousing with him. Puzzled by Dieter’s espousal of the Dwarf Tax, but has not pressed the issue. Will not say anything which might cast any suspicion on Dieter.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘Princess’:</strong> Hopeless infatuation: Rallane knows that no Elf could marry into the Todbringer family for myriad reasons, but he still entertains the occasional romantic fantasy. He sees her fairly often, and sometimes plays music in her chambers.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone:</strong> Dislikes the ‘crabby old harridan,’ but grudgingly admires her selfless devotion to her charge.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Does not know them. Suspects that @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}, the Graf ’s current paramour, had a lover within the higher echelons of the military before she became involved with Graf Boris, but does not know who (see @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann}).</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Has no dealings with them, but knows High Wizard Albrecht Helseher by reputation as a formidably intelligent man. Has noticed Deputy High Wizard Janna Eberhauer at court functions, but has no — yet.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Will say that he is a sound enough fellow, but a successful <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> test will detect a somewhat flat tone to his voice. He suspects the priest is involved with the Graf ’s paramour, and fears the possible political consequences of the affair. Angry at the man’s foolishness (Rallane never blames the female party). Suspects that the High Priest’s obvious agitation is due to being found out, perhaps by one of his junior priests.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour:</strong> Sympathetic, protective, and absurdly soft-hearted about her. They had an affair some four years ago, but will certainly not mention this to the Characters.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Rallane likes @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} very much. He knows that Petra Liebkosen is extroverted and flirtatious, but thinks (quite wrongly) that she is sensitive and vulnerable underneath. He dislikes Natasha Sinnlich, and suspects her of a cruel nature (correctly), but does not say so initially.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal:</strong> Thinks him an utter fool, and mocks him in private. His mimicry is deadly accurate and quite merciless.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt:</strong> A close friend and Elven brother-in-arms. The two enjoy reminiscing about old times (very old times by human measure), singing together (Allavandrel has a passable voice), friendly archery contests (Rallane is skilled with the bow after all), drinking, and romancing.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor:</strong> Knows him only by reputation: that he argues for the interests of merchants very capably and lives pretty well. Does not suspect him of anything.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician:</strong> Knows him only slightly. Aware of his unsavoury reputation, but likes his impulsiveness and flamboyance. Rallane has noticed that poor Baron @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan} seems calmer and happier with ‘Herr Doktor’ looking after him, on the rare occasions when he sees the baron.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Rallane does not know them, but believes them to be capable men, even if he dislikes their formality. He thinks they are too dull to be dishonest.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} </strong><strong>— </strong><strong>The Fixer:</strong> Sascha has been part of Rallane’s audience and the Elf has drunk with him on occasion as part of a larger group. Rallane doesn’t remember much about him, other than his face.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Exchanges a polite word with Breugal in passing, and makes sure to keep on his right side, but secretly finds his dress and manner ridiculous.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>He’s never met her and hears that she’s no fun.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>He knows she’s a good person, but finds her very dull.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Gymnasts}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Gymnasts}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-FInal 2}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Elven Lightsinger}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Water Polo Tournament}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Final}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants and Jousting}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>\n<h3>Rallane at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>Rallane Lafarel can be encountered at various Carnival events. Other Elves can engage him in conversation, especially at an artistic or specifically Elven event, and can impress him if they speak knowledgeably about the art or performance in question.</p>\n<p>Given his fondness for the city’s hostelries and his habit of giving impromptu performances after a few drinks, he might be encountered in the evening, sometimes in the company of friends such as @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}, or @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}. Skilled performers may ‘sit in’ and try to impress him with their own abilities; introductions can be engineered through NPCs with whom the Characters are already on good terms.</p>\n<p>Although Rallane does not oppose the Dwarf Tax, he does not enjoy being accused of instigating it. The Characters may have the opportunity to rescue him from an encounter with angry Dwarfs, just as described for the @JournalEntry[CMLm6gyQWagxg38f]{Chancellor}.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Rallane can introduce the Characters to @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten}, and @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel}, especially if all four are encountered together in one of the city’s drinking establishments. Although Rallane is friendly with @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}, he is reluctant to introduce inquisitive Characters to her, for fear that they might expose her affair with @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}. He might be persuaded to introduce one or more Characters to the ‘Princess,’ especially if the introduction can be framed as a merry escapade to circumvent and thwart her old dragon of a chaperone. If any Character makes a strong enough impression on @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina}for her to want to meet them, Rallane is more than willing to help.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/rallane-lafarel.webp","folder":"YbdT1wAfqZmWtR79","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":-100000}}}

Decades ago, Baron Victor Karstadt chose to surrender his nobility and the Duchy of Karstadt as a condition of a deal with the von Bruners to secure a significant loan.

The family fortunes have significantly changed for the better since the von Bruner deal, as evidenced by their growing numbers and luxurious accommodations.</p>\n<p><strong>Hellin Karstadt-Stampf</strong>&nbsp;is the current head of the family and a woman so wealthy the Jungfreuds courted her for years, despite her effective lack of nobility.</p>\n<p>House Karstadt is known for trading in ores, metal, and luxury goods, running mines, and, more recently, moneylending. It maintains a bank in Ubersreik&rsquo;s Merchant Quarter, and owns a number of well-guarded warehouses on the north bank of the Teufel. The Karstadts also have offices in Altdorf and Nuln, all managed by prominent family members, and finance several merchant trains crossing the Grey Lady Pass to Bretonnia and the Dwarf Holds.</p>\n<p><strong>People:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Actor[xOht8JBYfudZp9Qr]{Luithold Stampf}</li>\n</ul>"}

{"_id":"uOqWtxfjRN3BfC2z","name":"Status","content":"<p>Old World society is highly stratified — common folk are in little doubt as to their place in the society whilst the elite enjoy power and prestige that is brutally enforced and therefore largely unchallenged. Most people in between are acutely aware of their standing, and preoccupied with improving it. This is represented by Status, which can modify the interactions between people of different social classes.</p>\n<h3>Tiers and Standing</h3>\n<p>Status is expressed as a Tier — from lowest to highest: Brass, Silver, or Gold — and a Standing — which is a number, generally from 1–5, showing how respected the character is within their Tier. </p>\n<p>If you have a higher Tier than another character, you have higher Status. If you are in the same Tier as another character, then you are higher Status if you have a higher Standing.</p>\n<h4>The Three Tiers</h4>\n<p>The most important distinctions in Status are the three Tiers:</p>\n<p><strong>The Gold Tier</strong>: Reserved for the rulers of society; those who directly serve them as advisors, protectors, and maintainers of the law; and the independently wealthy. To reach this position requires hard work, success, and not a little luck. All in the Gold tier are rich, respected, and of higher Status than those in the Silver and Brass tiers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Silver Tier</strong>: Populated by well-to-do townsfolk and those following professions requiring skill and expertise. Tradesmen, craftsmen, and merchants make up most of the upper ranks of the tier, whilst the bottom is filled by those providing services. These folk lead relatively humble lives, but they are still respectable. People of the Silver Tier are of higher Status than those of the Brass Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>The Brass Tier</strong>: Occupied by peasants and those in the poorest professions which often require no particular skills. The Brass Tier also contains many criminals, ne’er-do-wells, and those who don’t make any living at all. </p>\n<h3>Determining Status</h3>\n<p>Your Status is determined by your Career level. Beside the name of your Career level is your Status, marked as ‘Brass 3’, ‘Silver 1’, or similar. This is the Tier and Standing. Should you change Career, check the new Status by the name of your new Career Level, and mark it on your Character Sheet.</p>\n<h3>Changing Status</h3>\n<p>Status changes for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You change Career.</li>\n<li>You gain a Talent that modifies Status.</li>\n<li>The GM imposes a change in Status due to in-game events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever causes a change in Status, you should take time to explain what exactly occurred, and the impact this has on your character. If you have changed to a different Career Level, say from a Student to a Scholar, what precipitated this? What subject did you study? And how does your character now feel after graduating? Taking time to explain your changing circumstances makes your character more rounded and believable.</p>\n<h3>The Effects of Status</h3>\n<p>Status influences a number of situations that impact your Character. Often these involve making Tests easier or more difficult. The GM may expand or limit these influences as they wish.</p>\n<h4>Charm</h4>\n<p>Status impacts Charm significantly, with those of higher Status more easily able to get what they want, and those of lower status finding it harder to secure influence. In most circumstances, those of a higher Tier gain a bonus of +10 to Charm Tests influencing those with a lower tier. Similarly, those of lower Tier suffer a penalty of –10 to influence those of a higher Tier. The GM may also apply these modifiers to those of different Standing in the same Tier, but this is rarer.</p>\n<p>If the target of the Charm attempt is atypical, this might not work as usual however. An individual who ‘Defies Status’ would mean no modifiers apply, and one with ‘Extreme Views’ might mean that the opposite modifiers apply (–10 rather than +10, for example).</p>\n<h4>Entertain</h4>\n<p>Status does not normally influence Entertain tests. However, a GM ought to consider that some entertainments are thought fitting to particular venues. A peasant playing a hurdy-gurdy is not likely to go down well at an opera house, whilst even a mediocre orchestra is likely to draw a significant audience if it starts performing on the village green.</p>\n<p>As such the GM might like to consider the sort of audience a performance is normally aimed at, and the audience that is actually available, and apply suitable modifiers.</p>\n<h4>Intimidate</h4>\n<p>If you have a higher Status than the target of your Intimidate, you typically gain a bonus of +10.</p>\n<h4>Gossip</h4>\n<p>Gossip tends to be stilted between people of different classes. Any Gossip Test between individuals of different Tiers suffers a penalty of –10.</p>\n<h4>Leadership</h4>\n<p>Status plays a very important role in Leadership. Indeed, the State Army normally only grants higher ranks to those of noble birth.</p>\n<p>If you are a higher tier than the target of your Leadership Test, you gain a bonus of +10. If you are two tiers higher, the bonus increases to +20.</p>\n<h3>Maintaining Status</h3>\n<p>In order to benefit (or suffer) from Status, you have to act in accordance with your role in society.</p>\n<p>It may be that you wish to pass incognito, presenting yourself anonymously. Typically, you will be counted as having a Status of Brass 3 if you do this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Hans the noble wears the latest fashions and always buys the best trappings. He rides his lovingly groomed horse into a village, pausing only to let his herald announce his presence to all. He fully benefits from his Gold 2 Status. His brother Heinrich dresses in old clothes, hides all his courtly garb under the bed, and acts like a nameless wanderer. He is treated as having a Status of Brass 3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Keeping Up Appearances</h4>\n<p>Characters need to spend a certain amount of money to maintain their lifestyle. As explained in @JournalEntry[5gvMwgLgn3fAW3VM]{The Cost of Living} there are minimum expectations of expenditure for each Tier.</p>\n<p>Should a character fail to live up to these levels of expenditure they will begin to be perceived as being of lower Status, losing 1 point of Standing per week. </p>\n<p>To stop this decline, the character must resume spending the money expected of them, whereupon they regain 1 point of Standing a week until they recover the lost points.</p>\n<p>Should Standing reach 0, your tier drops by one and your Standing is set to 5. If you are already at the lowest tier, then your Status sticks at Brass 0.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Pietr is a Noble and has been slumming it in the East End of Altdorf for the last two weeks, letting his Standing of Gold 3 drop to Gold 1 as he eats poor food, drinks cheap beer, and hostels in flop houses. Should another week pass and Pietr does not change his ways, his Standing will drop to Gold 0, which immediately becomes Silver 5. Should this occur, Pietr’s father will almost certainly step in to curtail the family shame…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Earning Money with Status</h3>\n<p>Your Status is directly linked to the amount of money you earn while working. The higher your Status, the more money you can earn as your good name attracts business. If the GM agrees, during play you can spend a week to work in your Career assuming you are in a place where such is feasible (it’s hard to be a Watchman in the middle of a wasteland). This is called Earning.</p>\n<p>When Earning, make an <strong>Average (+20) Dramatic</strong> Test against the Earning Skill of your Career (the Skill marked in italics in the Career’s first level). If passed, you receive the money marked in the table below. If failed, you receive half the money. If an Astounding Failure (–6) is scored, you have a very bad week, and earn nothing (or have your money stolen, or some similar mishap). </p>\n<p>This total is not strictly speaking how much money you earn, it’s more a representation of how much money you have left at the end of the week after all your expenses are taken into account.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is the same amount of coin earned with an @JournalEntry[lRWvy2uSVgq4RADa]{Income} Endeavour.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Gunther the Coachman decides he’ll work for the Four Seasons Coaching House for a week while his peers research a library for things he frankly doesn’t understand, and secretly thinks may be heretical if he did. The GM agrees to let Gunther enact some Earning, so Gunther rolls against his Drive (Coach) skill (his Earning Skill for Coachman) and passes. Given his Status is Silver 2, he can roll 2d10 and earn that much silver. Unfortunately, he only rolls a 1 and a 2 for a total of 3 silver shillings; clearly Gunther was drinking a lot after his long work shifts, and has little coin remaining…</em></p>","folder":"KBFMpqeeMFWhdpSI","sort":1000001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":1000001}}}

{"_id":"uRYJa7d36ckfIw6S","name":"The Traitor Flees","content":"<p>Law Lord @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}, Magister Magistri of the Cult of the Purple Hand, has decided to flee.</p>\n<p>When things went wrong at the Palace, he had the option of staying in the hope that the attempt to assassinate @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} was successful. However, at the back of his mind was the possibility that @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} had been captured, in which case his own identity might have already been revealed.</p>\n<p>Wasmeier thus decided to quit the Palace and move to his town house; a much safer place, where he could start gathering information on events in @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{the Palace} and the city. Wasmeier reasons that if his own involvement has been discovered, a troop of armed guards will come after him, forcing him to flee. On the other hand, if the @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppelgänger} succeeded and @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} was dead or free, then Wasmeier could resume his role of Law Lord once more with nobody the wiser.</p>\n<h3>Wasmeier’s Apartment</h3>\n<p>There is no incriminating evidence here apart from examples of the Law Lord’s handwriting for comparison with the note sent to the Hoflich-Doppelgänger. An empty vial beside a small pile of ashes will be spotted on a successful <strong>Hard (–20) Observe</strong> Test: these are the remains of the potion and scroll Wasmeier used to make his escape.</p>\n<h3>The Graf’s Command</h3>\n<p>The Characters have been instructed to deal with the traitor Wasmeier. They may be willing to do this, but they are faced with a few minor problems.</p>\n<p>For a start, one or more may be wounded from encounters earlier in the evening. @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Deputy High Wizard Eberhauer} can help with magical healing, and at the GM’s option she may cast some protection Spells on the Characters as well.</p>\n<p>If the Characters need any particular weapon or armour, assume that the Palace Guards can oblige by lending pieces of armour (chain mail only), hand weapons, and shields.</p>\n<p>The final problem will be reaching @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} house, since in all probability none of the Characters will know where it is. Members of the Watch will escort them there.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich} will give the party a Middenheim Seal that identifies them as important servants of the city, but apart from this no direct assistance will be forthcoming from either the military or the wizards.</p>\n<p>The Watch is already at full stretch policing the Carnival. They  fear that isolating Wasmeier’s house may provoke a riot, if people are prevented from returning home, especially after a long day at the Carnival. Also, at the back of their minds is the possibility that the planned replacement of the Graf was merely a prelude for some kind of uprising or assault, for which they will need all the strength they can muster.</p>\n<p>The wizards, on the other hand, are keen to get back to the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Guild}; Wasmeier was a trusted member of the Guild Council, and the spellcasters wish to begin checking up on any harm he may have caused there. At your option, an NPC such as @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} or @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} may volunteer to go with the party if they have befriended them earlier in the adventure.</p>\n<h3>Wasmeier’s Town House</h3>\n<p>This is situated in the @JournalEntry[8rK4NSrDXCpSKRSH]{Grafsmund}-@JournalEntry[aFOxMajVoBKRHinu]{Nordgarten} district. @Scene[UzUaqY37Y7WVKKmy]{Wasmeier's Town House} shows its general layout. As might be expected, the house is solidly constructed and well-maintained; it is worth something in the region of 4,000 GCs. All the windows are shuttered and barred (T 3, D 6), and all external doors are bolted (T 4, D 10). Unless stated otherwise below, internal doors have no locks or bolts.</p>\n<h4>Side Garden</h4>\n<p>This is well-maintained, with a fine selection of plants. In particular, the area near the kitchen is well stocked with herbs. The back gate is locked, and is the only direct access through an archway in an 8-ft high wall (18” thick). There is a gravel path around the edge of the house and stable; it is raked daily by Hawk the gardener, and is noisy to walk on (–2 SL to <strong>Stealth</strong> Tests). During the night a @Actor[K2hVEs8D1LajfuMg]{dog} belonging to the @Actor[5KIUihsaj8b0q6pb]{cook} prowls in here, and will begin barking if disturbed.</p>\n<h4>Front Garden</h4>\n<p>One area is devoted entirely to richly-scented roses, and a climbing variety grows up a trellis attached to the stable wall. A large fish-pond contains about a dozen Two-bearded Mulus. The gate to the garden has substantial bolts, but is open. The path to the front door, like that in the garden, is made of gravel.</p>\n<h4>Hall</h4>\n<p>A sturdy front door leads to a stone-floored hall with fine hardwood panels on the walls. The front door has a large brass knocker in the shape of an open hand that can be heard throughout the house. Decorations in the hall include two suits of full plate armour, a number of impressive-looking two-handed weapons plus large paintings of country scenes. In winter time, the hearth will contain a blazing log fire.</p>\n<p>One suit of armour will fit a character 5’ 8” tall, of average build and weighing 140–150 pounds, while the other will fit a character 5’ 11” tall, of heavy build and weighing 180–190 pounds. Both have been made for display rather than practical use, and despite their normal encumbrance they provide only 0/1 AP as if they were made of leather.</p>\n<p>The weapons on the walls consist of two two-handed swords, one two-handed axe and one two-handed flail. Again, all are made for display, and suffer a penalty 1 of –10 to hit and –1 damage.</p>\n<h4>Library</h4>\n<p>This is very well-stocked with books on law, history, geography, and other dry, non-fictional subjects. The doors have locks (CR –20) but are unlocked. A highly-polished wooden floor fills the room with the smell of varnish.</p>\n<h4>Lounge</h4>\n<p>This room is thickly carpeted and draped in various hues of purple. Six plush armchairs take up a lot of the floor space, and by each is a small table. A cabinet on the south wall contains spirits, liqueurs and glasses, and beside stands a bookcase with some light reading: historical novels, collections of folk-tales, bestiaries, and such. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test will reveal that the bookcase is hinged, and forms a secret door to the stable.</p>\n<h4>Dining Room</h4>\n<p>The central area is given over to a fine oak table with chairs for a dozen people. The rest of the room has cabinets for silverware, glasses, fine Bretonnian porcelain, and so on: enough for a decent banquet. Fine, but faded, tapestries line the walls. The room has an exit onto a patio through a pair of glass doors (<strong>TB 2, W 2</strong>) which is locked (<strong>D +20, SL 0</strong>) and bolted on the inside, covered by heavy drapes.</p>\n<h4>Kitchen</h4>\n<p>A typical layout is seen here, with tiled walls and floor. The cook @Actor[5KIUihsaj8b0q6pb]{Swelt Tunger}, keeps the place immaculately clean and very well stocked. The only (live) animal allowed in the place is his pet dog, @Actor[K2hVEs8D1LajfuMg]{Growler}. Tunger has a small room off the kitchen. The door to this, like those to the cellar and garden, is generally locked (all <strong>D +20, SL 0</strong>). In addition, the kitchen door is bolted shut.</p>\n<h4>Cellar</h4>\n<p>Not shown on map. This is about 20-ft square, and has a small but fine collection of wine plus various foodstuffs in bulk: flour, sugar, cheese, and so on.</p>\n<h4>Stable</h4>\n<p>The north half of this building has two storeys, with the upper level being used as a hayloft. The place is also home to Hawk, who doubles as a gardener and stable-hand. A trapdoor and ladder lead from the hayloft to the stable area proper. Two fine warhorses, @Actor[23UqP4Uk1taS9t0z]{Thunder} and @Actor[5xx2E9gDl3oCNdAD]{Lightning}, are kept here. The rest of the space to the south is taken over by tools, plants, etc., plus an unusual wagon (detailed below). The main double doors are kept secure by a thick wooden plank; the smaller north door is also locked. There are two secret doors leading from the house to the stable. These only work from triggers in the house, and cannot be opened from the stable side.</p>\n<h4>The Battle-Wagon</h4>\n<p>This four-wheeled wagon is normally covered by a tarpaulin. It measures 9’ long and 4’ wide; its base is 3’ off the ground, and the wagon’s sides are 3’ high — except for the back side, which is 5’ high, hinged at the bottom, and can be lowered when required.</p>\n<p>The cart is special in a number of ways. All the wood has been treated to make it flame-proof; the sides have numerous small, sharp hooks that hamper anybody trying to clamber aboard, imposing a further –20 to all <strong>Athletics </strong>and other relevant Tests. Vicious, 6-in spikes protrude at right angles all along the circumference of each wheel, and a lever near the driver causes 2-ft blades to spring out from the axle of each wheel. These blades (which do not rotate) and the spikes (which do) cause [[/r 1d6 + 2]] damage to anybody who gets in the way of the moving wagon. The final feature is a false floor, metal-lined and packed with gunpowder — about 10 barrels worth in total! A ten-second fuse leads to a torch-holder on the driver’s side. This makes the wagon a large travelling bomb: the reason for this will become apparent.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: THE BATTLE-WAGON</em></h3>\n<p><em>Grognard players will surely remember Wasmeier’s battle-wagon, and they may send the Characters to his house prematurely in order to destroy it – and, perhaps, the house along with it. The grognard box @JournalEntry[Y2Tz145Dqgfl1Chf]{‘The Villain’} presents various options for punishing players who target @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} without collecting evidence, and it could be that the battle-wagon is in the house of another NPC altogether, leading to awkward questions when the Characters are caught breaking into the home of one of Middenheim’s esteemed Law Lords.</em></p>\n<p><em>Wherever the Characters find the battle-wagon, they may decide to destroy it before it can be used. If they have discovered that the body of the wagon is packed with gunpowder, all well and good: they will damage the house and possibly some neighbouring structures as well, but that is all within the scope of play. If they make the decision based purely on the players’ memory, though, the GM is completely justified in visiting a range of embarrassing consequences upon them.</em></p>\n<p><em>The fuse to ignite the bomb may not be where the players remember it being. Perhaps there is no fuse at all, and Wasmeier has cast a Spell which allows him to detonate the gunpowder with a command word.</em></p>\n<p><em>Alternatively, there is an obvious fuse, and it fizzes convincingly for a few seconds – but then it either goes out or lights the nearest lamp on the wagon’s body.</em></p>\n<p><em>Perhaps the fuse lights one or more lamps as above, but it also detonates the powder. It simply does so after a delay of five or ten minutes: this is Wasmeier’s estimate of how long it will take to drive from his home to the gates, but it is also just long enough for the Characters to light the fuse, run for cover, become curious that no explosion has taken place, and return to investigate.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Landing</h4>\n<p>A large skylight (bolted shut) provides light here and the place is decorated with potted plants.</p>\n<h4>Washroom</h4>\n<p>This contains two sets of wash-basins, towels, etc., plus a garderobe shaft leading to the drains below. Both doors have bolts, and the eastern door is also locked (count as a <em>Normal Door</em> for <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests).</p>\n<h4>Study</h4>\n<p>Unlike the rest of the house, this room is decorated to Wasmeier’s own personal tastes. The panelled walls are covered with various maps, royal lineages, historical timelines, and so forth. The floor is littered with various books, all concerned with Middenheim: history, law, religion, buildings, trade — every aspect of the city is covered. Wasmeier knows more about the city than anyone else alive. A huge throne-like chair of carved wood,  surrounded by all the books, sits in the middle of the room. The Law Lord has long dreamed of power, and seated on the chair he developed his evil plan of conquest. Both doors are always locked (count as a <em>Secure Door</em> for <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests).</p>\n<h4>Bedroom</h4>\n<p>A four-poster bed dominates the centre of the room. The floor is littered with the remains of half-eaten meals.The place has a rotten smell about it. The only clean items are Wasmeier’s clothes, which hang neatly in two huge wardrobes that cover the east wall. The south wardrobe has a false back, leading to the loft above the stable.</p>\n<h4>Guest Room</h4>\n<p>This is neatly furnished, and always clean and aired. A very fine full-length mirror is placed on the west wall (250 GCs).</p>\n<h4>Gaston’s Room</h4>\n<p>The domestic operations of the house are run by the butler/valet @Actor[R3XXfl4MATvenoqI]{Gaston}. His room, despite being small, is exquisitely well-kept. Everything is in its correct place, and not a speck of dust can be found.</p>\n<h4>Lurk’s Room</h4>\n<p>Two locked and bolted doors (count as <em>Normal Doors</em> for <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests) lead the way to the living quarters of @Actor[BlccBsLkU7lCPOEL]{Lurk} — Wasmeier’s one-man army. A drape covers the entrance to a nest of a place that Lurk uses for a bed. If anything, Lurk is even more untidy than Wasmeier in his eating habits.</p>\n<p>The bedroom also contains Wasmeier’s personal (count as a <em>Treasure Chest</em> for <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests) treasure chest. This holds coins to the value of 500 GCs and an equal worth of gems and jewellery, mostly obtained during his younger days as a Wizard. It also contains an enchanted amulet containing three @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.HpFkVJ2lYPAWumUL]{Great Fires of U’zhul} spells, which can be released one at a time by speaking a short trigger phrase inscribed on the back. Treat these spells as though they were cast with +5 SL. Along with this, an enchanted opal brooch containing the spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.9wmmln3DunIqGXM2]{Flight} (this works once and is cast automatically with +5 SL if the wearer falls more than 10 yds). Several grimoires and a sack of ingredients for all the spells he knows are in a separate compartment. Finally, it also houses Wasmeier’s supply of poison: 3 doses of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.qfd01sggD9xbCuJY]{Black Lotus}, 5 doses of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.5fowsr8vslorjeB2]{Mandrake Root}, and 7 doses of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.JbSjlgUdzsl5ok95]{Heartkill}.</p>\n<h4>Strong Room</h4>\n<p>The fortified door to this room has no less than three locks (count as a <em>Vault Door</em> for <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests). The only key to these locks is held by Lurk, although they are normally open.</p>\n<p>The room contains all of Wasmeiers material connected with the Cult of the Purple Hand: names of members, codebook, past activities, biographies, and notes on all the major citizens of Middenheim. If the party has played earlier instalments of the <strong>Enemy Within</strong> campaign, there are also copies of letters to Kastor Lieberung. Note that Wasmeier has never met Lieberung personally, and will not recognise a Character who has been impersonating him.</p>\n<p>Among the letters is an open envelope bearing markings of the  Four Seasons mail Service from Altdorf which contains @JournalEntry[FfgdX03BZTEA4hLr]{a letter} addressed to Law Lord Wasmeier.</p>\n<p>There is also a small aviary that houses carrier pigeons used to send messages to @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} — a small secret hatchway in the external wall is used for this.</p>\n<p>@Actor[BlccBsLkU7lCPOEL]{Lurk’s} job is to look after the pigeons and guard this room. At anyone attempting to gain access from the house, will have a barrel of flammable oil tipped over them. Then Lurk  sets it alight with a lantern always left burning for this very purpose. He then locks the door and throws the key out of a window.</p>\n<h2>Wasmeier's Henchmen</h2>\n<p>All these NPCs have keys to the parts of the house where they work, plus loose change to the value of 2–12 silver shillings. You should adjust their strength to suit the party.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/henchmen.webp\" width=\"237\" height=\"270\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[5KIUihsaj8b0q6pb]{Swelt Tunger, Cook, And Burglar}</p>\n<p>@Actor[K2hVEs8D1LajfuMg]{Growler, Guard Dog}</p>\n<p>@Actor[R3XXfl4MATvenoqI]{Gaston, Butler, Scribe, and Torturer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[GPmecH5STMzLNLc8]{Hawk, Gardener, And Poacher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[VFsw4ON2YyKZFdcE]{Sinistral - Hawk}</p>\n<p>@Actor[23UqP4Uk1taS9t0z]{Thunder} and @Actor[5xx2E9gDl3oCNdAD]{Lightning}, Warhorses</p>\n<p>@Actor[BlccBsLkU7lCPOEL]{Lurk, Bodyguard}</p>\n<h3>The Law Lord Waits</h3>\n<p>As soon as he arrives at the house, @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} will instruct his henchman to prepare for an attack. Remember, he may still be invisible due to the effects of the potion. All the staff will don armour and prepare weapons. Meanwhile, Wasmeier will get his magic items, spell ingredients, poisons, and gems from the chest in @Actor[BlccBsLkU7lCPOEL]{Lurk’s} room. Lurk will load the chest (and money) onto the battle-wagon, and then return to the secret room ready to destroy the contents if the house is attacked. The bodyguard places Wasmeier’s spell books in a haversack on his back.</p>\n<p>The remaining staff are also busy themselves with their assigned tasks:</p>\n<p>@Actor[5KIUihsaj8b0q6pb]{Swelt} will stoke up the kitchen fire so that he can sling a shovel-full of hot coals at an opponent. Treat this as an attack using  Swelt’s BS, with a range of 6 yards, doing 9 Damage and inflicting SL+1 @Condition[Ablaze] Conditions; the attack also has the Blast 1 and Distract weapon qualities. @Actor[K2hVEs8D1LajfuMg]{Growler} will be let out to patrol the garden area.</p>\n<p>@Actor[GPmecH5STMzLNLc8]{Hawk} hitches the horses to the battle-wagon and prepares for a getaway. He sets his @Item[I7JtbZtdm9q8SoYs]{man-trap} by the back stable door, covering it with straw and coating each of the jaws with a dose of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.qfd01sggD9xbCuJY]{Black Lotus}. The third dose is used to coat his rapier.</p>\n<p>@Actor[R3XXfl4MATvenoqI]{Gaston} waits in the lounge with @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, who by now has a sword coated with @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.qfd01sggD9xbCuJY]{Black Lotus}. Wasmeier casts any spells the GM deems appropriate in preparation for the coming fights. At the first sign of trouble, he flees to the stable: his henchmen each have one turn to reach the stable before he leaves on the battle-wagon. If dawn approaches, and no one has come to the house, he leaves anyway.</p>\n<p>The battle-wagon is built to be defended, and tactics will depend on just who managed to reach it in time. The rear side gives excellent cover against missiles from any pursuer, and the money may be used to cover its escape, with Wasmeier scattering gold behind the wagon so that any pursuers have to make their way through the resulting crowds. Wasmeier will head for the south gate, and once there will light the fuse and run for cover. The gates do not withstand the explosion and in the confusion Wasmeier and any henchmen will be able to get out of the city.</p>\n<p>The Characters will probably not have any horses but, as fate would have it, four mounted Watch members on crowd patrol approach the house soon after the battle-wagon left. Using the City Seal, the party can requisition the horses and go after Wasmeier. They will arrive at the south gate ideally just after the explosion.</p>\n<h3>Wasmeier At Bay</h3>\n<p>As the party emerges through the smoke and rubble of the ruined gate, they will see @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} about 50 yd away, standing alone in the roadway with any henchmen a few yards behind him. As the party approaches, the Law Lord will raise both arms aloft and utter a magical word of command — as one of the Inner Council of Wizards, he has access to the magical means of destroying the viaduct.</p>\n<p>With a huge cracking noise, a split will appear in the viaduct at his feet, spreading rapidly towards the city. Characters on the viaduct have two choices: run back or run forward. A 48-yd length of viaduct is affected, beginning at Wasmeier’s feet and travelling away from him. The section of viaduct takes one round to collapse fully, and if a Character is still in the area at the end of the round, they face a fatal 500-ft (167-yd) drop to the base of the Fauschlag rock.</p>\n<p>If anyone reaches @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, he fights to the death. If the combat does not go his way, he runs to the side of the viaduct and leaps over the edge. The Characters see him fall into darkness, but unknown to them, Wasmeier’s Opal Brooch gives him the power of flight. On the other hand, if Wasmeier defeats the party he heads towards the toll-gate at the other end of the viaduct. Using his natural authority as a Law Lord (since these guards know nothing of events in the city), he can order the gate to be opened to allow him through. In either case, Karl-Heinz Wasmeier will escape into the night, never to be seen or heard of again — at least not in the guise of a Law Lord of Middenheim.</p>","folder":"8RbZHSArNQNSMvQ7","sort":450000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 7: The Traitor Unmasked","sort":450000}}}

Most travelers through the region prefer the relative safety of river travel to journeying along uncertain roads, and with good reason; the Reikwald is a favoured haunt of outcasts, cut-throats, and other lawless folk. While all major routes are patrolled by road warden, their numbers are too few and the roads too long, so it&rsquo;s not uncommon to encounter upturned coaches and other signs of banditry. Te majority of the open clearings and abandoned ruins from past wars are claimed as camps by outlaws or by one of the herds of Beastmen roaming the deeper wood, and forays to clear these isolated places by regiments of the Reikland State Army are not uncommon. In most parts the Reikwald&rsquo;s canopy is not so overgrown as to block sunlight, but its depths are frequently gloomy and heavy fogs are common, especially along the marshier stretches of the @JournalEntry[The Reik]{river Reik}. Scholars claim before the Empire was founded the Unberogen tribe of Humans ranged across this misty forest alongside older tribes whose names are now lost to memory. Concentric rings of carved standing stones called &lsquo;oghams&rsquo; still exist from this era, though many are overgrown and almost impossible to find without a guide. Isolated communities still following ancient ways &mdash; old beliefs said to predate the coming of Sigmar &mdash; are said to hold such sites sacred.

It forms part of a street of buildings, so characters outside the tavern would need to run for about five minutes to get from one entrance to the other.</p>\n<p>The tavern&rsquo;s a bit taller than some of the surrounding buildings, so characters on the upper floor can attempt an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test to jump to a neighbouring roof. Failing the test would result in a character falling about 3 yards, which would result in 1d10+9 damage (modified for TB but not Armour). My inclination&rsquo;s to soften that a little to be a bit more cinematic if the scene ends in a rooftop chase&hellip;. perhaps allowing characters to make a <strong>Hard (-10) Athletics</strong> Test to halve the damage, as they land in a passing dung cart or pile of refuse.</p>\n<p>The PCs will need to decide how they approach the tavern. If they all burst in through the front door then they&rsquo;re leaving the robbers with an easy escape route through the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Blocking off both entrances is probably their best bet, although this will mean splitting the party. Gaining entrance to a neighbouring building, and sending someone in to jump across to the upper floor is also possible, but risky: this probably requires a<strong> Challenging (+0) Charm or Intimidate</strong> Test to deal with an indignant homeowner, and then an <strong>Average (+20) Climb</strong> Test (assuming they have a rope), to get up on the roof before they can attempt to jump across to the tavern.</p>\n<p>If the PCs do split the party then my inclination would be to take each group out of the room and deal with them separately, keeping track of how many rounds have elapsed. This might result in one group of PCs bursting into the tavern ahead of others.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As the PCs at the front door are preparing to enter, they will spot a man in an old army coat coming out of the latrines outside. He&rsquo;ll see the PCs, mouth <em>&ldquo;oh shit&rdquo;</em>, and turn to run. As it turns out, he doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the robbery (although the PCs won&rsquo;t necessarily know that&hellip;) he&rsquo;s just an unrelated petty criminal with sufficient reason to be afraid of the Watch.</li>\n<li>PCs attempting to enter through the rear of the tavern will discover that the kitchen door is barred from the inside. Breaking it down is an <strong>Extended Strength</strong> Test, requiring a total of 3 successes. Alternatively, a <strong>Charm or Intimidate</strong> Test could be used to persuade the kitchen staff to unlock it. One or more of the kitchen staff may also seek to warn the robbers if they feel they can get away with it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unless they&rsquo;ve been alerted, the robbers are seated around a table playing cards when the PCs enter. If any of the PCs pass an<strong> Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test, they&rsquo;ll spot a duffel bag at the robbers&rsquo; feet: this contains the stolen documents. One of the robbers will be returning to the table with a round of beers.</p>\n<p>In the first round, the robbers will spring for their weapons and kick the table over to provide cover (<strong>-20 to hit if anyone targets them with missile weapons</strong>). Other patrons will scatter everywhere once the fight starts, which could potentially impede either side. Characters firing missile weapons in the tavern will risk hitting an innocent bystander if they fail by -3 SLs or more. One of the robbers will grab the duffle bag and attempt to flee with it, either towards the kitchens if none of the PCs have come through that way (although he&rsquo;ll still need to unbar the door if he reaches it), or up to the second floor where he&rsquo;ll attempt to jump to a neighbouring building.</p>\n<p>The robbers are unlikely to surrender, as they know that they will be hanged for their crimes if captured. They will instead seek to fight off the PCs, or buy enough time to escape with the papers. If the opportunity presents itself, Helmut will grandstand a little, accusing the PCs of being agents of injustice whose laws only serve to protect the idle rich while poor men starve. He&rsquo;s also likely to claim that a few of them will be dining with him in hell that evening.</p>\n<p>The PCs might decide to stake out the tavern instead, potentially in an attempt to catch whoever means the purchase the documents in the act. This isn&rsquo;t at all unreasonable, but will be extremely difficult. Make it clear to them that this is an area where a group of watchmen (or other strangers) are likely to draw attention, and remind them that the robbers are local heroes. If the PCs insist on going this route then <strong>Stealth (Urban)</strong> Tests are probably required (adjusted for difficulty depending on what they are attempting). If the PCs all pass then the robbers will exit together after a couple of hours, to meet their contact and sell the papers on for blackmail. The PCs can then either spring whatever form of ambush they&rsquo;ve contrived (which probably means that the robbers need to pass <strong>Perception</strong> Tests or start the encounter <strong>Surprised</strong>) or attempt to tail them. If any of the PCs fail their <strong>Stealth (Urban)</strong> Tests then they have been spotted, which is likely to result in one or more of the tavern&rsquo;s patrons or staff spotting them and tipping off the robbers about their presence. The robbers will then attempt to sneak out as discretely as possible, unless they believe that they have been surrounded in which case they attempt to break through whichever side of the cordon appears weakest (although their information may well be incomplete, if some of the PCs have managed to remain hidden).</p>"}
{"_id":"vJmImfkNn1DONyrZ","name":"The Graf's Garden Party","content":"<p>In Power Behind the Throne, the Graf ’s @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party} is only covered briefly. Taking place in the Royal Gardens from 2:00 to 8:00 p.m. on Marktag, it offers the Characters a golden opportunity to get to know many of the key figures at court who can help them resolve the plot of the adventure.</p>\n<h2>The Royal Gardens</h2>\n<p>Sometimes confused with the nearby @JournalEntry[PHMDyuBDTAHCFztS]{Konigsgarten}, the @JournalEntry[Zg4O0sojSzCr7wuU]{Royal Gardens} are in fact located within the palace complex. A broad and grassy inner courtyard with a formal shrubbery, a topiary garden, and a hedge maze in the form of a wolf ’s head, the whole area is crisscrossed by shining walks of marble chippings and dotted with statues.</p>\n<h3>Getting In</h3>\n<p>It is almost impossible to get into the garden party without a written invitation. These take the form of small scrolls sealed with the Graf ’s personal seal and addressed by name to the holder. There are several ways the Characters can get their hands on an invitation, both legitimate and otherwise. There are also a few plans that might suffice to get them inside. A few of the more obvious approaches are covered below: if the Characters try anything else, be prepared to improvise.</p>\n<h4>Who You Know</h4>\n<p>The Characters have already been in Middenheim for several days, and the Carnival has been under way for two. There have been some opportunities to meet some of the major NPCs and make a good enough impression to earn an invitation. Most of these are covered in @JournalEntry[zm2zG5Tw0uj9H3ao]{The Powers that Be} of <strong>Power Behind the Throne.</strong></p>\n<h4>A Reasonable Facsimile</h4>\n<p>If the Characters can get their hands on a genuine invitation (by stealing it from an NPC, for example), they can get reasonably convincing copies made in their own names if they know a good forger or have the requisite skills themselves. This involves an Opposed Test between the forger’s Skill and the Perception of an average palace guard (Perception 52). </p>\n<h4>Do You Know Who I Am?</h4>\n<p>Bluffing one’s way in takes considerable nerve and ability, but it is not impossible. Posing as a visiting dignitary from out of town with their entourage, the Characters may be able to bluff and bluster their way in without an invitation, even if their names (or those of their assumed personas) are not ‘on the list’. This only works if at least one of the Characters can successfully pose as a figure of Gold Status.</p>\n<h4>What’s it Worth to You?</h4>\n<p>Bribery is probably the least effective means to try. The palace guards and staff are all very well paid, so they do not need extra money and they stand to lose a great deal if they are dismissed from their posts — to say nothing of the possible charges of treason if their negligence results in a real or potential threat to the Graf or his family. All bribery attempts are <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong> at least.</p>\n<h4>Shhhh!</h4>\n<p>Stealth is also a risky tactic: anyone caught trying to sneak into the palace — garden party or no garden party — is regarded as a potential assassin and dealt with accordingly. The guards are trained to look out for potential threats (they make <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Tests to spot a potential assassin while on duty), and there are dogs and wizards in attendance, in case of magically invisible assailants.</p>\n<h4>The Entertainment</h4>\n<p>Characters with appropriate Skills may attempt to get into the garden party as hired entertainers. Perhaps they have been noticed while busking at the Carnival (see @JournalEntry[BRFG82wEhR3OCLzW]{The Crowds}), or perhaps they have had some other opportunity to impress someone who suggested them to Brueghal or some other person in charge of arrangements. The Character is invited to an audition, which takes place somewhere in the outer palace. This is the most demanding audition they have ever faced: all Tests are <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong>, as this is an extremely discerning audience.</p>\n<h4>Supplies</h4>\n<p>The garden party is being catered largely out of the palace kitchens, but there are a few suppliers who are bringing food, drink, flowers, and other items on the day, and if the Characters are clever and well-connected they may be able to gain entrance by posing as these suppliers. However, they find that all supplies must be delivered and set up half an hour before the party, and all suppliers and their staff are required to leave the garden immediately after their work is carried out. Finding an excuse to stay, or a place to swap clothes and assume a more fitting persona, will challenge the Characters’ ingenuity.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE HAND OF FATE</em></h3>\n<p><em>If the Characters have fallen at every hurdle and failed to find a way to glean an invite to the party, it is possible that one might fall into their lap. Someone sends a handful of invites to wherever the Characters are staying without further explanation. Who is this mysterious benefactor? None other than the Law Lord @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Hienz Wasmeier} himself, who wishes to get a look at the now infamous Kastor Leiberung and his companions first hand. If so, Wasmeier will attend the party brielf from 6.00 to 6.30, keeping mostly to himself.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>In Attendance</h3>\n<p>The following major NPCs attend the garden party, though not all are there for the whole time.</p>\n<h4>The Graf</h4>\n<p>For reasons explained in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} is not himself, and has not been well for some time. He sits on a wooden throne in a small, open-sided pavilion, nodding absently to the arriving guests who bend the knee as custom dictates, but seemingly lost in a dark, brooding reverie. @Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal} the Chamberlain stands at his right hand, ready to carry out any order or to hurry away anyone who is annoying, boring, or tiring the Graf. The pavilion is flanked on either side by a detachment of six Knights Panther, and liveried servants scuttle to and fro, bringing food, drink, and other things that the Graf ignores.</p>\n<h4>Other Guests</h4>\n<p>The party is teeming with other guests, enjoying Middenheim’s social event of the year and taking care to see and be seen. These guests serve mainly as sources of overheard gossip and as obstacles, cutting in front of a Character to engage a dignitary in meaningless small talk just as the party was hoping to make an influential acquaintance, bumping drunkenly into a Character and accusing them of assault or pickpocketing, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Visiting Dignitaries</strong>: An embassy from Kislev is in the city, hoping to speak to the Graf about certain problems on their northern borders and remind him of a pact that gives Kislev the right to request a force of Knights Panther at need. There are also visitors from other cities in the Empire, and a few from other countries.</p>\n<p><strong>Prominent Middenheimers</strong>: In addition to the major NPCs listed above, the party is also thronged with Komission convenors, guildmasters, priests of various deities, and other members of the city’s upper echelons.</p>\n<p><strong>Strolling Players</strong>: Musicians and other performers have been hired or invited to entertain the guests. Minstrels, jugglers, and others stroll the ground, and a small, curtained stage has been set up opposite the Graf ’s pavilion for brief performances by several of the more highbrow entertainers who are performing at the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music} and the @JournalEntry[Zg4O0sojSzCr7wuU]{Royal Gardens} during Carnival week.</p>\n<p><strong>Servants and Lackeys</strong>: Servants in the Palace livery move to and fro constantly, some bearing trays of food and drink that they offer to guests, and others collecting empty glasses and plates. Other servants patrol for dropped litter and keep an eye out for trouble. Meanwhile, the personal lackeys of several guests weave through the crowd, carrying messages from their master or mistress to some ally or paramour, or manoeuvring themselves into spots where they can eavesdrop on the conversation of a rival.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/whispers-in-the-maze.webp\" width=\"630\" height=\"335\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/whispers-in-the-maze.webp","folder":"Rl69ySRItdzlcGbE","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Graf's Garden Party","sort":-100000}}}

The Von Ottinger mansion is what in what we might think of as a gated community, made up of spacious mansions along the waterfront, on a hilltop to be upwind of the city smog.</p>\n<p>The PCs will see a small crowd of people on the street outside, clustered around a night watchman who&rsquo;s been shot. Most of them have obviously recently awoken, being clad in coats hastily thrown over their night shirts. The night watchman in question (&ldquo;Old Gunter&rdquo;) is a chap of advanced years, who&rsquo;s paid by the district to patrol with a lantern and sound the alarm in the event of intruders. He&rsquo;s been shot, and is lying in a pool of his own blood. A smashed lantern lies close by.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of gawking and talk about how deplorable this all is from the gathered spectators, but no one&rsquo;s actually helping. If the PCs want to, they can attempt a <strong>Challenging (+0) Heal</strong> Test to staunch the wound or a <strong>Fellowship Test</strong> to send someone off to summon a physician (this will probably be an <strong>Average (+20) Leadership</strong> Test, with a -10 penalty if the NPC has a higher social status). The night watchman will bleed out and die otherwise.</p>\n<h3>Questioning the night watchman:</h3>\n<p>If the PCs question the night watchman, he can tell them that he was doing the rounds with his lantern (<em>&ldquo;Eleven o&rsquo; Clock and All&rsquo;s Well&hellip;&rdquo;</em>) when he heard sounds of a disturbance from the Ottinger residence, and startled by the sight of a band of masked men. He called out to challenge them (<em>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</em>), and one of them responded by shooting him with a pistol. If the night watchman hasn&rsquo;t been healed, then his replies will become considerably less coherent after the first few questions (<em>&ldquo;so cold&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;tell my wife I love her&hellip;&rdquo;</em> etc), until he eventually passes out.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Charm</strong> or <strong>Gossip</strong> Test (which will be <strong>Average (+20)</strong> if he&rsquo;s been healed, and anywhere between <strong>Challenging (+0)</strong> and <strong>Hard (-20)</strong> if not, depending on how much blood he&rsquo;s lost) might jog his memory to the extent that he&rsquo;ll recall that there were about half a dozen robbers, some of whom appeared to be wearing army coats. A couple of them were carrying duffel bags, but them seemed otherwise unencumbered with stolen goods. If the PCs roll +2 SL or higher, he might also remember that one of the robbers had some sort of distinguishing mark &ndash; perhaps he caught sight of the mark from a branding that wasn&rsquo;t fully concealed by the masks they wore., or he saw that one of them ran with a slight limp, favouring one leg over the other.</p>\n<h3>Questioning the crowd:</h3>\n<p>The PCs might well interview members of the crowd, which is made up of wealthy Altdorfers and their servants. They&rsquo;re angry and frightened, and will generally expect immediate deference from their social inferiors (which is likely to include the PCs). None of them know anything important, but they&rsquo;ll be very happy to offer their opinions on the matter.</p>\n<p>Representative sentiments will include: <em>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a disgrace, whatever&rsquo;s Altdorf coming to?&rdquo;, &ldquo;whoever did this ought to be strung up!&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;You there &ndash; yes you, with the beard! Do you really think this is good enough? We all pay our taxes, and this poor fellow&rsquo;s shot on our very doorstep. I demand to know what the Watch is going to do about it!&rdquo;</em></p>"}

The Crooked Corridor is a narrow gorge through the mountains not far from the border with the Wasteland. It is useless to most merchants, being far too tight for wagons or horses, and dangerous to boot as much of the path is perched precariously on the edge of steep cliﬀs, meaning the slightest slip of a foot could lead to a painfully inglorious end.</p>\n<p>Completely impassable in the winter and perilous at all other times, the Crooked Corridor was known only to goat herders and smugglers until a spate of Greenskin raids brought the pass to the attention of the authorities.</p>\n<p>Several decades ago, Emperor Mattheus II ordered the construction of a fortress to watch over the Crooked Corridor after repeated invasion.

{"_id":"vqt8fmk6KuQAxz87","name":"Combat","content":"<p>Sooner or later you will need to stop someone in their tracks, or someone will try to stop you. When diplomacy fails, is not attempted, or is not understood as a basic concept, Combat begins!</p>\n<p>In Combat, lots of individuals take actions in a short space of time, many of them in direct opposition to each other. You will still be taking Tests to resolve these actions, but timing and a host of other factors become more important, so we have some rules to make everything work.</p>\n<h3>Timing</h3>\n<p>In Combat, the exact timing of actions matters more, so time is organised into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rounds</strong>: A Round is enough time for all characters to attempt a Test and move into position. It’s normally a just few seconds, the GM can decide exactly how long if necessary.</li>\n<li><strong>Turns</strong>: During a Round, each combatant has a Turn to perform an Action and a Move.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiative Order</strong>: Each combatant usually takes their Turn in order of their Initiative Characteristic, from highest to lowest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Combat Summary</h3>\n<p>Combat follows these steps until one side flees or is defeated:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Determine Surprise</strong>: The GM determines if any characters are Surprised . This normally only happens on the first round of combat. See the section below.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Round Begins</strong>: If the rules call for something to happen at the start of the Round , it happens now.</li>\n<li><strong>Characters Take Turns</strong>: Each combatant takes a Turn in Initiative order, starting with the highest Initiative. Each Character can normally perform a Move and an Action on their Turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Round Ends</strong>: The Round ends when all combatants have taken a Turn. If the rules call for something to happen at the end of the Round, it happens now.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeat Steps 2–5 As Required</strong>: Continue to play through Rounds until the combat is resolved.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Initiative Order</h3>\n<p>Combatants act in Initiative order during the Round, with the highest Initiative acting first, until all involved have taken a Turn. If you want this to work quickly at the table, have the players sit in Initiative order. If multiple combatants have the same Initiative, they act in order from the highest Agility to the lowest. If they also have the same Agility, then roll an Opposed Agility Test, with the winner choosing who goes first for the combat. Some Talents impact combat order (see Chapter 4: Skills and Talents). Example: Tollich, with an Initiative of 38, always acts ahead of his companion, Perdita who has an Initiative of 33. If they attack a coven of cultists, each with Initiative 35, the combat order would be: Tollich (38), the Cultists (35), Perdita (33).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Roll For Initiative!</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some groups prefer to randomise Initiative. There are several ways to do this, choose your favourite:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Each character rolls an Initiative Test to determine a SL.</em></li>\n<li><em>Each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their Initiative.</em></li>\n<li><em>Each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their Agility Bonus + Initiative Bonus.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The GM notes the results in decreasing numerical order and uses this as the Initiative Order. You could use this order for every Round (quickest option) or roll each Round (gives some variety to the order; slow characters have the chance to not always go last).</em><br><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong>You can find these initiative options in the system settings menu.<em><br></em></p>\n<h3><em>Rounds Outside Combat</em></h3>\n<p><em>Out of combat, the exact timing of those actions is usually flexible. Sometimes it is helpful to use Rounds outside of Combat to help organise everyone’s contributions; for example, Extended Tests happen over several rounds, with one Test taken each Round.&nbsp;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Surprise</h3>\n<p>Taking your enemy by surprise gives you a big advantage. If one side is planning an attack, they can attempt to harness the element of surprise by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hiding</strong>: Make a successful Stealth Test in appropriate cover. Characters may oppose this with a Perception Test if they are wary, or if the GM is feeling generous.</li>\n<li><strong>Sneaky Tactics</strong>: Attack from behind, in the dark, through heavy fog, or from above! The GM may allow a Perception Test to spot the incoming attackers if appropriate.</li>\n<li><strong>Distractions</strong>: Loud bangs, milling crowds and an especially engaging sermon are just some of the distractions that could harbour a surprise attack!</li>\n<li><strong>Unprepared Defenders</strong>: If the enemy are particularly unwary, the attackers automatically surprise their victims.</li>\n<li><strong>Something Else</strong>: Other sneaky and ingenious plans concocted by cunning players — the GM has the final call on the possibility of surprise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there is a chance the ambushers will be spotted, the GM will typically call for <strong>Opposed Stealth vs Perception</strong> Test, usually with the character with the worst Stealth opposing all potential spotters. If the ambusher wins, each defeated character gains the @Condition[Surprised] Condition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If no-one is surprised, proceed with the combat as normal.</p>\n<p>If anyone is surprised, they can use a Resolve point to remove the @Condition[Surprised] Condition.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Taking Your Turn]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Attacking]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Criticals and Fumbles]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Combat Difficulty]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Ranged Combat]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Two-Weapon Fighting]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Unarmed Combat]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Mounted Combat]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Advantage]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","folder":"c8pB03MJECRvVVdb","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Combat"}}}

This can make him seem vague or distant to those who don't know him well, but he bears no ill-will to anybody, and it is difficult to dislike him.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[CEvm5EOc9gTBObd3]{The Legend of Shining Rock}</li>\n<li>@Item[PPl9ggAzG0IcUw1p]{Shard of the Shining Rock}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Brother Eberhardt </strong>- Young monk, minder for the PCs while they visit the Abbey\n<ul>\n<li>Brother Eberhardt Merkel is young, in his late teens. He was recently sent to the Abbey from the town of Meissen to continue his education and become a priest of Sigmar. Brother Eberhardt is an earnest fellow, but rather shy. He is especially awkward around women and intimidated by Dwarfs. Eberhardt has never seen an Elf before and will be a little nervous around such beings.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Brother Emile </strong>- Archivist\n<ul>\n<li>Brother Emile Furtw&auml;ngler has been a member of the Abbey for the past 30 years, having made his way from scribe to illuminator to archivist. He retains a keen and inquisitive mind though he is in his late 50s. Brother Emile is not the adventurous sort, being too cautious to tempt fate. He is generally quite friendly to those who show proper manners and respect for the work of others. In contrast, the archivist has little time for bunglers and does not suffer fools gladly.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Brother Gregor </strong>- Cellarer\n<ul>\n<li>The 40ish year-old Brother Gregor Adenauer has been a member of the Abbey for the past fifteen years and has earned his way to the position of cellarer with the responsibility of ensuring that the Abbey is well provisioned. Unlike others in the monastery, Brother Gregor does leave the Abbey to conduct business with farmers and vintners in the Enclave. He is friendly and talkative, though not to the point of forgetting his place within the Abbey. If need be, Brother Gregor can keep secrets.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Brother Gustavus </strong>- Elder, former Archivist\n<ul>\n<li>Brother Gustavus B&ouml;ll has been a member of the Abbey for the past 60 years, previously serving as the Abbey&rsquo;s archivist. Now in his 90s, Brother Gustavus is blind as a result of cataracts. Still, he is not enfeebled and retains a sound mind. He considers Brother Emile &ndash; successor to Gustavus&rsquo; successor &ndash; as a reasonably good man who is not inquisitive enough to become an outstanding historian of the Sigmarite faith. Brother Gustavus has kept many secrets from Brother Emile for fear the younger monk might not be able to restrain himself from telling those in authority.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Brother Karl </strong>- Gregor&rsquo;s assistant, secret member of the Sacred Hammer</li>\n<li><strong>Brother Simon </strong>- Young monk, delivers letters to boatmen for transport to other temples.</li>\n<li><strong>Brother Tobias </strong>- Secretary to Abbot Berrener</li>\n<li><strong>Brother Marcus </strong>- Medicus\n<ul>\n<li>He is very easy to get along with. Always open for some small talk and listening to the daily needs of the clerics. He can however become very harsh, should things not work as he has expected them to. He is also stubborn and sometimes a little too direct in discussions. Overall he seems to be friendly, unless someone argues against him. Marcus is a very devout follower of Sigmar and is almost zealous in any arguments regarding religion. He has a very narrow-minded point of view concerning the world and is biased towards any stranger. Even laypriests of Sigmar have a hard time against Marcus. He is very short tempered and often curses others or threatens them with the witch hunters. Even though the Order of the Silver Hammer is considered a respected part of the cult of Sigmar, his reference to it is a little too enthusiastic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Of note, look to Broken, which was never supposed to imply the&nbsp;<em>Bestial</em>&nbsp;trait was ignored completely.<br /><br /><strong>Broken:</strong> The animal has been domesticated. Now tame, it gains +2d10&nbsp;<strong>Fel</strong>, even if it has the&nbsp;<em>Bestial</em>&nbsp;trait. Further, it can now learn more&nbsp;<em>Trained</em>&nbsp;traits (see&nbsp;<strong>WFRP</strong>&nbsp;page 199).</p>\n<p><strong>Calm:</strong> The animal gains a bonus of +10 to Tests to ignore panic caused by the <em>Skittish</em> trait for each point it has in Calm. It can have a maximum of <strong>WPB</strong> rating in this trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Drive:</strong> The animal is trained to pull a coach, cart, plough, buggy, or similar. The animal can pull up to its own body weight for <strong>TB</strong> hours without needing to make an Endurance Test. The animal can also pull up to twice its body weight for short hauls of <strong>TB</strong> minutes. The animal's gains a bonus of +1 <strong>TB</strong> to do this for each point it has in Drive. It can have a maximum of <strong>WPB</strong> rating in this trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Fetch:</strong>&nbsp;The animal is trained to spot and retrieve an object or prey undamaged.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack</strong>: The animal is trained to carry great weights on its back. It can carry its Strength rating in Encumbrance points upon its back for each point it has in Pack. This limit is doubled for each step in the Size trait to the creature has above Large. It can have a maximum of <strong>TB</strong> rating in this trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Pointer:</strong>&nbsp;The animal is trained to spot birds and 'point' to them by freezing and aiming their muzzle towards the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical:</strong> The animal is trained to accept a spellcaster as a rider. Without this Trained trait, the animal typically shies from spellcasters.</p>\n<p><strong>War:</strong>&nbsp;The animal is trained to carry a rider into the hell of war. It can use its Rider&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>WP</strong>&nbsp;instead of its own&nbsp;for all appropriate Tests</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NEW TRAITS</h2>\n<h3>Amble</h3>\n<p>The creature has a smooth gait, making it more comfortable to ride over long distances. Add +Amble hours to any length of time a rider can comfortably ride. Further, reduce the Combat Difficulty for<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><em>Shooting From Horseback</em><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>by 1 step.*</p>\n<p>*: Amble references rules I use where you can't ride a horse for longer than&nbsp;<strong>TB</strong>&nbsp;hours a day without picking up some&nbsp;<em>Fatigue</em>&nbsp;Conditions, depending upon the results of an&nbsp;<strong>Endurance</strong>&nbsp;Test. Further, Shooting From Horseback is a penalty of at least &ndash;20, depending upon the circumstances. Riders with the&nbsp;<em>Trick Riding&nbsp;</em>Talent reduce this difficulty by 1 step.</p>\n<h3>Fine</h3>\n<p>This repurposes the Item <em>Fine</em> Quality for animals. For animals the <em>Fine </em>Trait represents a pedigree. Mongrels cannot purchase the <em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to represent breeding, but it could be purchased to show a dog with a particularly pretty face or similar.</p>\n<p>If a Player wants to buy any special breed beyond the generic versions, at least 1 instance of&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;should be bought to show it's a purebred animal accessing the special rules.</p>\n<p>For each&nbsp;<em>Fine</em> Trait the animal has, its price is doubled and its @JournalEntry[Going To Market]{Availability} is one step less.</p>\n<p>A typical Telland actually starts at 7GC (the base cost of 3GC 10/&ndash; is doubled because of the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality).</p>\n<p>The more&nbsp;<em>Fine</em> Traits purchased, the stronger the bloodline of the animal, and the more impressive it appears. This brings no advantages beyond bragging rights and high returns if the animal is ever sold.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Insisting special breeds have the Fine quality is not a firm rule, as you may wish to keep costs low at some points; it's more of a guideline that you should most always follow.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0px; outline: none; padding: 0px;\">Sure-Feet</h3>\n<p>The creature can instinctually find its footing, even when it has a rider on its back. The creature automatically passes all Tests concerning uncertain footing caused by such things as screes, rocky trails, heavy undergrowth, and similar.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;None of the creatures in the&nbsp;<strong>WFRP</strong> rulebook should have either of these two traits, but they could be used as an Optional wherever you feel it fits.</p>\n<h3>Swimmer</h3>\n<p>Start with <em>Swim</em> Skill +10</p>\n<h3>Ugly</h3>\n<p>This repurposes the Item <em>Ugly</em> Flaw for animals. Taking the <em>Ugly</em> Trait for your pet shows it's particularly ill-favoured in appearance, which may come with penalties in some situations.</p>\n<p>Ugly animals attract negative attention, and related Fellowship Tests might even suffer a &ndash;10 penalty.</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em> Trait the animal has,&nbsp;halves the listed price and improves @JournalEntry[Going To Market]{Availability} by one step.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note: Exotic items do not have their Availability modified by being Flawed &mdash; they are always difficult to find, even shoddy examples.</p>"}

Some of them will probably work best as local flavour while others are likely to provoke a bit more interaction from the PCs or could be used to foreshadow future adventures.</p>\n<p>&bull; A band of flagellants have set up shop in a busy street, and are haranguing passersby, threatening them with divine retribution if they do not repent. Their leader claims to be a follower of Valten, who he calls Sigmar reborn, and vows to purge the city of its wickedness. (&ldquo;Do you think Sigmar is blind to your drunkenness, your fornications, and your thievery? Do you think your wicked hearts are cloaked from his righteous gaze? Turn from your sins and repent, or burn forever in his cleansing fire!&rdquo;) Most of the people going by seem indifferent (and very keen to avoid eye contact), but the flagellants have drawn a small crowd. If the PCs make a point of challenging them then the flagellants won&rsquo;t back down from a fight.</p>\n<p>&bull; An agitator claims that a plague of man size rats have descended on the farmland in Averland, and devoured the grain. (\"Do you want to know why grain prices are going through the roof? Do you want to know why your children are starving? Karl Franz doesn&rsquo;t want you to know, but I think you have a right to know the terrible secret his government&rsquo;s been government&rsquo;s conspiring to keep from you! A plague of hideous beasts, rats that walked like men, unleased on the farm country in Averland, filling their foul bellies with our corn and stealing away the folk who raised it. Emperors, nobles, watchmen, the whole bloody lot of them&hellip; just puppets for those bastard ratmen!&rdquo;) The PC will notice that the agitator&rsquo;s wanted for knifing a man in a tavern brawl, and will have the option of giving chase (using the pursuit rules on p.166) &hellip; although this may well feed a conspiracy theory that the authorities have something to hide. The Agitator will start a Distance of 4 ahead of the PCs. The PCs might initially need to make Athletics checks to catch him (against the Agitator&rsquo;s Agility of 40), then Strength or Intimidate Checks to force their way through the crowded streets (against the Agitator&rsquo;s Strength of 30), then Athletics checks as he jumps over a cart that&rsquo;s blocking the road.</p>\n<p>&bull; A baker complains that someone&rsquo;s put a stone through his window. It seems they&rsquo;re agitated about rising bread prices, but he explains that grain prices have been going up as well. Word is that there&rsquo;s a dock strike at Carroburg, and the dockers are leaving it to rot until their demands are met.</p>\n<p>&bull; A peddler is selling charms in the shape of an angel, which he claims will bring good luck. A pair of Sigmarite zealots accost him, accusing him of idolatry. If the PCs ask the peddler to explain himself, he will tell them that an angel is reported to have fallen from the skies over the Grey Mountains. The story is that it was pursued by a swarm of winged demons. The angel turned and slew its attackers, but one of its wings was crippled in the fight and it plummeted to the earth.</p>\n<p>&bull; The PCs hear speculation at the pub that a Dwarven entrepreneur has sponsored this year&rsquo;s Reiksd&aelig;g festival. There are mixed feelings about this: some are excited by the rumour that he&rsquo;ll be giving away dwarf beer, others feel that the Reiksd&aelig;g is a human celebration, and resent the rumour that a dwarf&rsquo;s trying to cash in on their culture.</p>\n<p>&bull; A woman&rsquo;s body is found floating in the Reik. The River Wardens are fishing her out when the PCs arrive, and aren&rsquo;t too pleased when the PCs arrive&hellip; there&rsquo;s no love lost between them and the Dock Watch (&ldquo;About bloody time your lot got here&hellip;&rdquo;) The murder victim will be identified as a local prostitute (&ldquo;Martha Shilling&rdquo;). Investigation reveals that she&rsquo;s been suffered several knife wounds, many of them to the arms and hands as she presumably sought to defend herself. The body&rsquo;s eyes have also been cut out: this form of mutilation isn&rsquo;t uncommon in murders, as tradition has it that a Priest of Morr can look into a corpse&rsquo;s eyes to recall the last thing the dead person saw.</p>\n<p>The locals are generally indifferent, although there&rsquo;s a chance that a hysterical old woman insists that the Beast has returned (and is probably answered with considerable mockery from the others). Some of the locals will acknowledge that they heard her quarrelling with her pimp (&ldquo;Lucky Leos&rdquo;) who believed she was holding money back and threatened to carve her up. Unless the PCs intervene, this will be seen as sufficient evidence, and the pimp will be promptly taken into custody to face charges, loudly protesting his innocence to anyone who&rsquo;s willing to listen.</p>\n<p>&bull; A crippled soldier&rsquo;s begging by the side of the road, singing loudly and off key as he begs for coppers. If questioned, he will tell the PCs that he enlisted to fight Archaon, and has been left destitute as the injuries he suffered in the fighting mean he is unable to hold down a job.</p>"}

{"_id":"xJjJZBv4YfUDxg2U","name":"Timeline - 10-11pm","content":"<h2>10:00 p.m.</h2>\n<p>The company’s attention is drawn by raised voices from the vestibule. The footman posted at the door is trying to restrain an ill-dressed young woman, who clutches a ragged child to her bosom. She struggles with the servant and one of the watchmen repeatedly calls out for Lord Erich to come and acknowledge his son. This incident was arranged by Gravin Maria-Ulrike to embarrass her host: the young woman was a von Holzenauer servant, seduced by the young noble and dismissed when her pregnancy became known. This is not uncommon among the nobility of all nations and all ages: however, in the Reikland a noble father is expected to make secret provisions for the welfare of any illegitimate children and their mothers — dependent, of course, on their keeping quiet. But by simply casting this woman off, Lord Erich has breached an unwritten code.</p>\n<p>Lord Erich instructs his servants to get rid of the woman and her child as quickly and quietly as possible, while Gravin MariaUlrike will insist that she be given a fair hearing. A battle of wits and social standing will follow between the two nobles and their respective servants, masked by the appearance of charity and polite concern, but as savage beneath the surface as any pit fight.</p>\n<h2>10:15 p.m.</h2>\n<p>A Skaven Gutter Runner scales the wall nearest the kitchen and climbs to the roof, blocking the chimney with a wad of rags.</p>\n<p>Minutes later, black smoke billows out of the kitchen, driving the cooks coughing and spluttering into the yard. Once the kitchen is clear of people, the Skaven sneaks in and mixes Warpstone into all the spices being used to prepare the food, mull the wine, and mix the punch. Then it escapes over the wall. Unless the Skaven is stopped, or the contaminated spices are kept aside, mutations will start to break out within half an hour amongst any who consume the tainted goods. If spotted, the Skaven will flee, heading for the city walls. It will not return to its master for fear of being followed.</p>\n<p>If the gravin is not serving the interests of House Saponatheim, under cover of the disturbance, Lord Siegfried von Saponatheim tries to approach the gravin and dose her wine-glass with some of his emetic powder. As before, the Characters can spot this with a successful <strong>Opposed Perception/Sleight of Hand</strong> Test.</p>\n<p>Schadelfaust challenges Dieter to a duel.</p>\n<h2>10:30 p.m.</h2>\n<p>Lord Siegfried von Saponatheim uses more of his emetic powder to dose the food at the buffet table. This can be spotted by any nearby Character with the same an <strong>Opposed Perception/Sleight of Hand</strong> Test as before. Anyone who consumes the tainted food will become violently ill within ten minutes (unless mutations have already started breaking out) and the ball will come to an abrupt end. Should this happen, Lord Erich will have failed in his attempts to impress the townsfolk and the von Holzenauer cause ends in embarrassment. If the Characters expose Lord Siegfried, he is thrown out in disgrace and the von Saponatheim cause is also finished.</p>\n<p>While Lord Siegfried is carrying out his plan, another one is unfolding in the reception room. Lord Erich’s agents somehow managed to lay their hands on @Actor[BJ4KfXW4SJani9ra]{Manfred von Saponatheim}, the true legal heir to the Duchy of Saponathiem (see ‘Nastassia’s Wedding’, Plot 6, page 58). Depending on how much time has elapsed between the wedding and the ball, and whether or not the Characters were charged with seeing Manfred safely to Frederheim, von Holzenauer’s agents either freed him from the hospice or intercepted the party conveying him there. Cleaned up, dressed in von Saponatheim colours, and given a light dose of some calming drugs, Manfred struts urgently from noble to noble, telling everyone that he is the von Saponatheim heir, his family is cheating him, and his sister Nastassia is a fraud. Some of the guests whisper about the stunning resemblance between the man and Graf Wilhelm von Saponatheim, lending his argument credence. While this is certainly embarrassing for the von Saponatheim cause (and possibly for Gravin MariaUlrike as well), this incident is also charged with pathos as the earnest but unsuited Manfred desperately pleads his case to one guest after another, and begs them to help him regain his birthright.</p>\n<h2>10:45 p.m.</h2>\n<p>Acting upon a secret signal from Lady Nacht, Christoph Engel animates the stuffed boar in the lobby, which attacks the nearest guest until it is destroyed. Nacht wishes to see how the various groups at the masquerade deal with adversity. The Boar is actually an illusion, and all Wounds it inflicts will disappear after a few minutes.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"lzflRKyLfHkcsNPL","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"xOLH8T4aTfPICuZE","name":"The Skull Hunt","content":"<p>If the Characters have behaved intelligently, they should find themselves hired to deal with the problem soon after reaching the village. The Characters have two days before the harvest is due to begin, and until this time the villagers have no real need to venture out. If the skull problem is not solved in that time, the villagers refuse to work the vineyards unless guarded by a personal escort: their livelihood may suffer, but it’s better than being killed!</p>\n<p>Even if the Characters are willing and able to guard the villagers, the harvest still fails, as tales of the flying skulls have spread and vital migrant workers have stayed away.</p>\n<p>The militia, led by @Actor[bnyNHCGyixKPSQOA]{Parzival}, is at the Characters’ disposal. However, despite their leader's urging, the militia have no desire to go skull-hunting, for glory, gold, honour, or for any other reason. Parzival therefore orders them to maintain a watch along the village boundary while he joins the Characters on their hunt. His boredom with village life has left him all too eager to engage the skulls and demonstrate the superior quality of Reikland nobility. He will be especially happy to accompany the Characters if any are Reiklanders themselves, and will ask for news of Ubersreik should they have any.</p>\n<p>The Characters should seek to achieve three objectives: learning about the previous sightings, trying to capture a skull for study, and tracking them to their point of origin. If they do not arrive at these objectives on their own, Parzival haughtily suggests them as the only 'obvious' course of action.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A SHARE OF THE PROFITS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Enterprising (or unscrupulous) Characters may try to haggle for a better price, especially once they realise that they hold the entire village’s hopes for the coming year in their hands. If they persuade Henri-Phillippe to offer a percentage profit from the harvest as payment (a <strong>Hard (–20) Haggle</strong> Test), the following sums are relevant. A good harvest nets @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} 500 GCs in one year’s time, rising by around 100 GCs for each extra year the wine is matured. Full maturity is reached in five years. Rocheteau opens negotiation at 30 GCs but may be bargained all the way up to 100 GCs if the Characters are truly ruthless.</em></p>\n<p><em>That is for immediate payment: deferred payments may be negotiated, based on the increasing value of the maturing wine, but the party must state how many years they wish to wait and undertake to return at the appropriate time to collect. For each harvest day lost, Rocheteau’s profit falls by about 10%.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Sightings</h3>\n<p>The previous sightings are covered briefly above. The Characters are quickly able to find the witnesses, and other villagers answer their questions once they know that @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} has hired them to resolve the situation.</p>\n<h4>Seel Baldurich, Village Brat</h4>\n<p>Seel is an obnoxious, snot-nosed seven-year-old. He was playing in the woods when he saw a skull at Location 1a on the @Scene[xCHI2UlFpaaUOflT]{Sightings map}, and ran back in fear. However, having been warned time and time again not to play so far from the village, he lied about its position, claiming that he saw it at Location 1b. Under close questioning, the Characters may make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test to realise that Seel may not be telling them the entire truth and, if  challenged, he admits to the deception. Seel is particularly enraptured by tales of adventure and swashbuckling action, such as fighting off Mutants after narrowly escaping a coach crash. If the Characters win him over with such tales, he opens up about his deception.</p>\n<p>Seel saw a skull heading away from him, that is all. However, his imagination has elaborated this quite a bit: ‘breathing fire’, ‘howling’, ‘covered in horns and spikes’, and so on. Since the young lad half believes this by now, it is up to the Characters to determine the truth of the matter.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[0eQzvUSeBpJGqrhw]{Isolde Gudhoffen}, Social Climber</h4>\n<p>Isolde’s encounter with a skull is Sighting 2 on the @Scene[xCHI2UlFpaaUOflT]{Sightings map}. She can only say that it appeared to be the skull of an animal. She is not sure, but if asked, she says that the thing’s eyes were glowing dimly. If taken back to the area, she is unable to locate the specific tree where she saw it, and searching the area reveals nothing of interest.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE FEMME FATALE</em></h3>\n<p><em>Any Character with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.6l3jvIAvrKxt0lA9]{Attractive} Talent or a Gold Status attracts Isolde’s interest, since she is seeking to get away from @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} and is impatient with @Actor[bnyNHCGyixKPSQOA]{Parzival’s} increasingly vague explanations for why he can't take them away to his holdings in Ubersreik to be wed. She will take the time to speak with any Character who appears likely to be able to offer her a rung up on the social ladder. If this has the effect of making Parzival jealous all the better, as she feels it will help to sharpen his mind on returning to Ubersreik with Isolde in tow.</em></p>\n<p><em>@Actor[bnyNHCGyixKPSQOA]{Parzival} has just enough nostalgia for his youth to think that a duel to first blood might be a suitable way to ward off any rivals for Isolde's affections — it is a small village, after all — and will issue a challenge to a Character if warranted. He favours a sword, and will provide one if his opponents lacks a suitable weapon.</em></p>\n<p><em>Unless taunted, Parzival will not fight to the death, and indeed things could get very bad for the Characters if he is killed. @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Rocheteau} dispatches news to Ubersreik at once, and the GM should follow this up as opportunity allows. </em></p>\n<p><em>While watching the duel, @Actor[0eQzvUSeBpJGqrhw]{Isolde} is surprised to find that she cares quite a bit more than she expected for @Actor[bnyNHCGyixKPSQOA]{Parzival's} wellbeing. Isolde lavishes praise on Parzival if he wins, and comforts him if he loses. If she feels the Character dueled him fairly, or perhaps even let him win, she will nod to them respectfully and view them favourably in the future. If however they wounded Parzival badly (4 wounds lost or more) or employed dishonourable tactics she treats them with contempt from now on.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Sigismund Halsbret, Missing Worker</h4>\n<p>One of the witnesses to Sighting 3, Sigismund decided to pack up and go. He worked at the Reuter household, and an inspection of his room (actually a corner of the hayloft) reveals that his clothes and his few other belongings have also gone. Sigismund’s employers considered him a lazy worker, and are not too distressed about his disappearance.</p>\n<h4>Knud Grapenpikker, Other Worker</h4>\n<p>Knud is the other witness to Sighting 3. He works at the Kallman farm and is somewhat obtuse, needing to be prompted often to reveal the little he knows. He and Halsbret were out working when they spotted a skull heading towards them.</p>\n<p>Sigismund started running, but Knud waited to hit it with his pet shovel, ‘Clod’. For whatever reason, the skull turned and flew back into the trees. Knud carries his shovel everywhere now, and even takes it to bed.</p>\n<h4>Erietta Surhardt, Unconscious Victim</h4>\n<p>This young woman currently lies unconscious in the Rocheteau house, tended by her mother and @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau}. She will recover consciousness in about two days, but will still be weak from blood loss. Successful mundane (a <strong>Challenging (+0) Heal </strong>Test) or magical healing restores her to consciousness, and an inspection (only to be carried out by a female Character, or a male who has thoroughly convinced all three women that he is a physician) reveals she was bitten twice.</p>\n<p>Erietta was attacked by surprise, and her only recollection is of ‘a gleaming white face with red eyes’ (Sighting 4 on the Sightings map). More information can be gained from her ‘rescuers’, Wanda and Hilda Klop and Imogen Uderlast. They heard a scream and ran to help, but on seeing a skull on Erietta they immediately ran away. Their courage returned when they saw the skull flying off into the forest.</p>\n<p>Wanda and Hilda are twins, and each habitually repeats what the other has just said by way of confirmation.</p>\n<p>Seeing Erietta and Elisabet together, any Character who makes a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test notices that they have a similar build and features: not enough to amount to a close resemblance, but perhaps enough for one to be mistaken for the other at a distance. This observation may not seem important at the time, but the GM may wish to point it out after the attack on the Rocheteaus’ house (see @JournalEntry[Yb6ew66hdbL4vBT3]{The Gravelord Responds}). Although only Gräber knows this at the moment, the attack on Erietta was a mistake. Seeing her in the distance, he mistook her for the woman who humiliated him on his previous visit.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder Lechart}, Village Fool</h4>\n<p>Unknown to anyone in the village — including himself — Wuder was one of the first people to see the skulls, although this was before they began to fly. Wuder was unlucky enough to end up in possession of a warpstone filling and this has left him both addled and with an unnearing sense for the presence of warpstone.</p>\n<p>@Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder} wanders freely around @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}, often roaming deep into the forest when the mood takes him. By chance, he came across the @Scene[gxjWgssIvXIUd2D7]{cave} containing the bones. While there, he picked up a small rock that fascinated him for no reason he could understand. It was a piece of warpstone, and when he thought he saw some of the bones move, he fled clutching the rock, keeping it as a lucky charm. Coupled with his filling, Wuder's exposure to corruption has been growing quickly, and it is only a matter of time before he mutates.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder} loses his ‘lucky charm’ (and he won’t give it to anyone without a struggle), he becomes very upset, and soon afterwards he sets off back to the cave to obtain another piece. Being so attuned to Chaos, he has no trouble locating it; curious Characters may profit from following him. However, if he does get a new piece of warpstone, he changes in new and different ways: @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.u7IJ1xm4pO5s9QgS]{roll for a three mutations}.</p>\n<h3>The Storekeepers</h3>\n<p>The snobbish and self-righteous Ludovic and Mathilda Reuter run the only store in the village. Items commonly needed by farming folk are stocked at normal prices and, since the village is quite prosperous, they also stock some fancy goods as well, though little of any practical use: folding card tables, toast racks, garden ornaments, and so on. These items are sold at 25% over the normal price.</p>\n<p>Mathilda is the village gossip, and if the Characters question her, they find that she knows many ‘truths’ about people in and around @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}. If stuck for a bit of gossip, she makes something up, usually something prurient and sensational that allows her to reflect piously on the state of the village’s morals: so unlike the decent lives she and her husband live. Here is a selection; the GM should feel free to add or elaborate as desired.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>RUMOURS</em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>@Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} has a mistress in Altdorf and Middenheim. (False: he only has a mistress in Middenheim.)<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>@Actor[bnyNHCGyixKPSQOA]{Parzival Aschaffenberg} has been disowned by his family for an ‘indiscretion’. (False, but he did get a servant girl pregnant.)<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Knud Grapenpikker is wanted for murder in Middenheim. (False: Knud has never been to Middenheim.)<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>@Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau} flaunts lovers before her husband. (False.)<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Gunter Semmelweiss spends a lot of time in the pig-shed. (True: he’s a miser and hoards money in the pig-pen, although Mathilda does not know this.)<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>@Actor[0eQzvUSeBpJGqrhw]{Isolde Gudhoffen} got her gold brooch by ‘being nice’. (False.)</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Being a snob who thinks herself more sophisticated than her neighbours, Mathilda has no time for local legends, history, and the like. She knows nothing of old battles, bones, or such things.</p>\n<h3>Capturing a Skull</h3>\n<p>This is not an easy task. Not knowing where the skulls come from, the Characters will have to wait for a skull to come to them. Beating the undergrowth around @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} is unlikely to have any effect.</p>\n<p>Unknown to the Characters, most of the previous sightings were experiments, as @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} learned how to control the skulls: moving, hiding, watching, following, and attacking. The attack on Erietta marked the end of his experiments, and Gräber has sent skulls to take up positions north, west, and east of the village. These are in position by approximately 3:00 pm on the day the Characters arrive.</p>\n<p>When the Characters encounter a skull, the GM can determine the success or failure of any attempts to capture it. They are small, and their shape means that they are not easily grappled (–30 penalty to all attempts to do so) but they might be caught in a net or something similar. The Players should be encouraged to try various approaches, with the GM judging each on its merits. All is not lost if the Characters fail to capture a skull.</p>\n<h4>Captive Skulls</h4>\n<p>Any captive skulls cannot be interrogated, but may be useful nevertheless. The behaviour of a captured skull depends on its state. If active, the skull does whatever @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} tells it; if passive, it keeps on trying to carry out its last instructions. If the skull is in a dormant state, the Characters may make use of its orientation ability (say by using it as a compass or by putting it on a lead), or attempt to gain control of it and perhaps use it to follow other skulls. Of course, the villagers will not be too happy at the prospect of a magical skull flying around the village, no matter how tame the Characters say it is! See @JournalEntry[sM6ypxnSWfyR64sO]{The Flying Death Skulls} for more information on tracking, controlling, and dealing with the skulls.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder Lechart} approaches within five yards of a dormant skull, it senses his warpstone and tries to move towards it. If able to move, the skull flies slowly up to Wuder (who watches in fascination), and then snuggles up to him like a pet cat, getting as close to the warpstone as possible.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: THE CELLAR</em></h3>\n<p><em>Grognard Players may remember that in the original adventure, ‘Grapes of Wrath’, the villain is one Dieter Maranauer, whose twin brother Stefan had an affair with @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet} and was bricked up in the cellar by a vengeful @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe}. They may decide to search the burgomeister’s cellar looking for evidence of the crime, but in this version there is no Stefan, no Dieter, no affair, and no hidden body. Even if the Characters take the cellar completely apart, they find nothing.</em></p>\n<p><em>Strangers who start pillaging people’s homes — or appearing to do so — will not make a good impression on the villagers, to say nothing of the burgomeister and his wife. If the GM is feeling especially cruel and the party does not include any Dwarfs or anyone with Trade (Engineer), a too-thorough search of the cellar might result in structural damage to the Rocheteaus’ house, or even total collapse.</em></p>\n<p><em>However the Characters may try to excuse their actions, the people of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} conclude that here is another group of adventurers who, just like many they have heard of, are nothing more than brigands trying to put on an air of respectability.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">After being caught in the cellar, the Characters suffer a –20 penalty to all Fellowship-based Tests when talking to any of the villagers. Destroying the burgomeister’s house will probably get them run out of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}, pursued by a mob of villagers brandishing torches and pitchforks.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"O0HfGcMmqK25GSdm","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":500000}}}
{"_id":"xZf74sxRYso6ZdgD","name":"The Elf Road & Mordin's Cave","content":"<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9492c92a-7fff-3225-8b9c-14e920e5ea5d\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However the PCs find the Elven highway, it takes special vigilance to follow the trail successfully. PCs who declined Mordin’s offer may still locate the Elven highway by tracking the Dwarf, although he will elude them if he becomes aware that he is being followed. The Elven Highway has not seen regular use for at least a millennium, and has faded almost entirely into the overgrown forest. Only a skilled tracker can perceive even the vaguest traces of the ancient roadway, and all the untrained eye sees is unblemished forest.  The path disappears entirely for long stretches, and PCs unaccompanied by Mordin Giltbiter must succeed at two <strong>Track Tests</strong> per day to keep on the trail. Failure results in a half-day delay, and a <strong>Navigation Test</strong> is required to regain the trail. Failing the Navigation Test indicates the PCs are hopelessly lost and will eventually arrive at The Tower. The journey from the Rouene to Tor Sethoi takes two days of hard walking. Traversing off -trail is unadvisable at best; progress on foot quickly becomes entangled in a prickly morass of undergrowth that seems to have a life of its own. If the PCs are without Mordin, they will have to camp somewhere along the trail (see Night in Athel Loren). If the players are led by the Dwarf, he invites the party to his hidden cave dwelling (Location 3) at the end of day one.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Mordin’s Cave</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the way to Mordin’s cave, the Dwarf appears conflicted about revealing the location of his home and argues over the subject with his wolfhound Varag (who apparently disapproves). As a result, Mordin leads the players through a series of convoluted switchbacks and trail reversals. PCs with the Track skill recognize that Mordin is trying to hide the location of his cave, but can identify the route with an Opposed Track Test.  The final approach to Mordin’s home is rigged with booby traps and chimes which he carefully diverts the party around. Shortly after arriving, Mordin excuses Varag and himself to check some nearby “critter traps” for dinner. The small cave itself is surprisingly well furnished with a dwarf sized bed, table and stools—all made of stone. The cave ceiling is too low to accommodate anyone other than Dwarfs or Halflings; others have to sit on the rocks outside. Nosy PCs will discover a suit of fine quality Dwarven Platemail hanging on an armour rack inside the cave. Mordin obviously spends a great deal of time polishing and caring for the armour, but players making a Routine (+10) Perception Test, notice the crown of the helm is cleaved open at a place matching the white streak on Mordin’s head. Hidden in a shallow niche under Mordin’s bed is a leatherbound journal wrapped in cloth.  The journal is written in Khazalid and tells the tale of a once great Templar of Grungi and his quest to recover a stolen family heirloom from a demented clan of Night Goblins. Apparently the Night Goblins in question had pilfered something called an “Aldrunr” (Arcane Dwarf rune), and Mordin has taken on a debt of honour to recover the Aldrunr at all costs.  The bulk of the entries describe Mordin’s relentless chase after the Night Goblins in question. In the final entry, Mordin debates whether or not to take a shortcut through a “dark forest.”  The sad truth behind Mordin’s tale is that the Night Goblins in question are long gone.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Upon returning, Mordin prepares a stew made from snake and other local “varmints” which tastes better than it looks. If questioned, Mordin has no recollection of the blow that stove in his helmet, nor any solid details previous to his time in Hunger Wood other than the vague story of the Aldrunr. After the meal, Mordin suggests an early end to the evening and shows the PCs to a grassy area where they can sleep outside, safe from his defences. Mordin warns PCs sleeping outside to keep the campfire lit and avoid wandering about the woods. PCs camping outside Mordin’s cave are subject to the Night in Athel Loren sidebar.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The War on Terrors</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The War on Terrors For over fifty years, Mordin Giltbiter has waged a secret war against the Wee Terrors from his hidden cave. In aeons past, the Terrors of Athel Loren might simply have been mischievous forest spirits, but the taint of Dhar has turned them into homicidal predators.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mordin is old and somewhat decrepit, with a scraggly beard and milky half-blind eyes that always seem to look past you. But the Dwarf is a skilled ranger and his pet wolfhound Varag compensates for his fading vision. Mordin knows the mushrooms of Hunger Wood well, having eaten them for many years. Mordin has no memory of the years before he came to Hunger Wood. He knows only that the Wee Terrors hold an object of great importance which he must recover to find peace in the afterlife.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mordin’s clothes are made of squirrel skins and he walks barefoot. A bundle of 8 snares is slung over his shoulder. In a ragged canvas satchel Mordin carries 2 doses of herbal antitoxins, a small knife and some dried Honeycups. Mordin’s cave, which is rigged with booby traps and chimes, is surprisingly well furnished with a bed, table and stools - all made of stone. Mordin’s wolfhound Varag never leaves his side.</p>","folder":"mF2lmkFMCmamukcB","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"xcdBouVomksZYYut","name":"The Altdorf Stage","content":"<p>Burdened as they are with a large and heavy crate and a delivery date that is approaching rapidly, the Characters must find a ride to Middenheim. The most obvious choice is to go by coach — the crate fits on the roof with other luggage, given a little work and a few Shillings to the coachmen — but this is not the only option.</p>\n<p>The Characters might hire, or even purchase, a cart of their own. While this saves them coach fares, they may find it harder to obtain accommodation for the night in coaching inns along the way. Most of the inns have arrangements with the most prominent coach runners, guaranteeing food and beds for their passengers, feed for their horses, top priority for any needed repairs, and security for their luggage: passing travellers, stopping in without advance notice, may find all of these things in short supply.</p>\n<p>Riding horses are quicker than carts and more independent than coaches, but the crate may be a problem. It is almost as heavy as a rider, and too big to sling over a saddle. A horse or mule requires a successful <strong>Average (+0) Charm Animal </strong>Test to accept the unusual burden, bucking it off if the test is failed. Be sure to describe the ominous crash the crate and its contents make when it hits the ground. </p>\n<p>More detailed rules for coaches, carts, and pack animals may be found in the <strong>Enemy in Shadows Companion</strong>.</p>\n<p>The rest of this chapter assumes that the Characters are travelling by coach. If this is not the case, feel free to make adjustments as necessary.</p>\n<h3>The Coaching Lines</h3>\n<p>A traveller wanting to go from Altdorf to Middenheim by coach has three choices: @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.wVPKOC48Odm7JJMQ]{Four Seasons Coaches}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.HqarwMVLyiaal4sK]{Castle Rock Coaches}, and @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.gCFx3Jzxj3h2EL49]{Ratchett Lines}.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.wVPKOC48Odm7JJMQ]{Four Seasons} is expanding rapidly, and its coaches leave its depot in Altdorf daily for all parts of the Empire. As part of its expansion, the house is acquiring coaching inns along all the major routes, for the exclusive use of its passengers. A coach departs for Middenheim daily year-round, leaving Altdorf at 10:00 am.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.HqarwMVLyiaal4sK]{Castle Rock Coaches} is based in Middenheim, and is fighting hard to keep its share of the capital’s route. It has made arrangements with many independent coaching inns along the way, and has blocked the efforts of Four Seasons to take control of several inns between Altdorf and Middenheim. Coaches leave for Middenheim every second day (Wellentag, Marktag, Bezahltag, and Angestag) at 7:00 am.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.gCFx3Jzxj3h2EL49]{Ratchett Lines} is a smaller operation, based in Altdorf like Four Seasons, though it is older. Some nobles prefer Ratchett because of its history, and because their families have always travelled by that line. Under increasing pressure from Four Seasons, the line’s coaches seem old-fashioned and a little shabby, but its employees pride themselves on the quality of their service. </p>\n<p>Ratchett Lines is trying to position itself as an exclusive and upper-class carrier, charging 10% more than its competitors. Its coaches do not depart according to a regular schedule: those engaged by noble passengers leave as soon as possible, regardless of the hour, while others leave when all the seats are taken.</p>\n<h3>Fellow Travellers</h3>\n<p>While the Characters might be able to book a coach all to themselves, it might be more entertaining to give them some interesting travelling companions. The number of possible companions depends on the size of the party and the capacity of the coach: most coaches can seat a maximum of six passengers inside and another six on the roof.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.Pa77IT9maJR1nU7M]{Alex Eisen}</p>\n<p>No matter how much care the Characters might have taken to avoid him, the insufferable boatman can always make a reappearance: perhaps his intended coach was full; or he was ejected because of offending another passenger of higher status, or the other passengers included nonhumans, or those from foreign lands, or people from one of the many other groups that he dislikes.</p>\n<p><em>‘Well, hello there!’ </em>says a familiar voice as the Characters board the coach.<em> ‘And there I was worrying that the journey would be dull! A slight change of plans, as you see, but it all worked out for the best! I never finished telling you about those Elves, did I? They plan to take over the rivers as well as the ocean!’</em></p>\n<p>The Characters’ hearts sink to their boots. It is going to be a long, long journey — especially if Alex’s loud opinions lead to conflict at an inn along the way. If the Characters are seen to be travelling with him, they could be thrown out as well.</p>\n<h4>The Jung Sisters</h4>\n<p>Ulrike and Bertha Jung, the daughters of a prosperous Altdorfer wool merchant, are travelling to Middenheim to visit their cousin @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}, a Lady at Court. They are accompanied by their bodyguard, Gunder.</p>\n<p>Both women are young (19 and 17 respectively) and clearly quite refined. If game stats are needed, they are both @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.2aKiMpKfVnXWNfmy]{Traders} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.0KNI4TzKqL2ZQfVl]{Clerks}, with Skills including Charm, Etiquette (Guilder), and Gossip, and Talents including @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.8lSoPDGrmeTIaapm]{Gregarious}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write}, and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.LPgjE0cexTVOBVCY]{Suave}.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Flying Death Skulls</span></h3>\n<p><em>Some grognard players may recognise these two ladies and their bodyguard from the adventure ‘Grapes of Wrath’, which was first published in issue 98 of White Dwarf magazine (February 1988) and was reprinted in The Restless Dead (1989).

His brow is thick and sloping, and his massive jaw seems to jut further forward than his twisted and flattened nose. He is clad in a leather jerkin and armed with a huge axe. He is a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.9q1yLMpfhX1bqvth]{Guard} and former @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.FgVH1pPS9oRq0o2Z]{Soldier}, with Talents including Menacing and Traits including @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.GbDyBCu8ZjDp6dkj]{Belligerent}and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.a8MC97PLzl10WocT]{Big}. His Intelligence is only 22, but given his strength and imposing nature he has never found this to be a problem.</p>\n<p>The young ladies are happy to engage in polite conversation on the journey, but woe betide any Character  who fails to show them proper respect. If the Characters have made a favourable impression on them by the time the coach reaches Middenheim, they may introduce them to their sister Kirsten. They are staying in guest-rooms in the outer palace during their stay in the city.</p>\n<h4>The Pilgrims</h4>\n<p>@JournalEntry[LsUklap1rbMtM7RO]{The Place of Shining Rock} is a shrine near Kutenholz that is sacred to followers of both Ulric and Sigmar. One or two pilgrims — devout followers of one god or the other, but not necessarily members of religious careers — board the coach at Altdorf and are let off near Kutenholz, where a side-road leads to the shrine. Such fellow travellers can be a good source of information about the religious situation — biased in favour of their own particular religion, of course. All this information can be found under ‘News and Rumours’ in this book and in <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>. This is a chance for you to feed the players any information that they might have missed.</p>\n<h4>The Mercenary</h4>\n<p>A military officer, recently retired from service, is heading for Middenheim, intending to enjoy the Carnival before enlisting with Baumann’s Blitztruppe, a famous ‘Free Company’ or mercenary unit that is mustering there before heading east on some undisclosed mission. While he knows nothing of the mission, he is able to fill the Characters in on the growing conflict between Ostland and Talabecland, which threatens to destabilise a significant part of the Empire. Like the pilgrims, this soldier can convey news and rumours that the Characters might have missed.</p>\n<h4>The Imperial Cartographer</h4>\n<p>A young man or woman, Bart or Bella Kurz, dressed in respectable but faded and slightly worn clothes boards the coach in Altdorf, after seeing several oddly shaped leather and wooden cases loaded on to the roof and secured with ropes. He or she is a cartographer working for the Imperial Survey Service, and has been sent to Middenheim to confer with members of the city’s cartographical service on the location of several settlements whose exact position is disputed.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have not yet heard the rumours of ducal cartographer Gulhein Tobwurst, who was recently fired over a number of egregious errors, Kurz will be happy to relate the tale in a gravely serious tone. It is said that Tobwurst’s maps show the town of Delberz in so many different places that emissaries have been sent from both Altdorf and Middenheim to search for it. Tobwurst is currently being held responsible for the tax revenue that has gone uncollected from the obscure settlement.</p>\n<h4>A Mission of Mercy</h4>\n<p>A Shallyan priestess or nun is travelling from Altdorf to take up a posting at the famed Great Hospice, a secluded hospital not far from Frederheim that treats disorders of the mind. More on the Great Hospice can be found in the companion volume to this adventure, <strong>The Power Behind the Throne Companion</strong>. If anyone aboard the coach is injured between Altdorf and Frederheim, she treats them; she gets off the coach at the small town, where a Shallyan nun meets her in a pony and trap.</p>","folder":"9l20ogJKAnhkPnIw","sort":275000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":275000}}}

Forenames include:</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Adhemar, Anders, Artur, Beatrijs, Clementia, Detlev, Erika, Frauke, Frederich, Gerner, Gertraud, Haletha, Heinrich, Helga, Henryk, Irmina, Jehanne, Karl, Kruger, Lorelay, Marieke, Sebastien, Sigfreda, Talther, Talunda, Ulrich, Ulrika, Werther, Willelma, Wilryn.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Human Names And Their Origins</em></h3>\n<p><em>Human names in WFRP are often taken from the real world, making it easy to research fun names online. The Reikland and much of The Empire uses Germanic names, the Wasteland has Dutch and Belgian influences, and Bretonnian names are loosely medieval French.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong>: Use the /name command to generate names.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Reikland, Human family surnames passed on from one generation to the next are most common in cities and towns, while in villages Humans are more likely to take on an individual surname when they reach adulthood. It’s common to take a surname from where you were born, such as ‘Wilhelm of Auerswald’. The nobility often have two surnames, one is the name of their House and the other is preceded by ‘von’ to indicate where their family holds land, such as Graf Zenechar Trott von Tahme, though individual family traditions vary widely.</p>\n<p>The most common surnames are derived from your occupation, or the occupation of a parent or grandparent. Examples include: Bauer (Farmer), Fleischer (Butcher), Schmidt (Smith), and Schuster (Cobbler). If a character has a particularly noticeable physical trait, this might be used as a surname. This can often be passed down from parents to children too, which can become confusing for literal-minded Dwarfs who may not understand a short person claiming to be Lang (Tall). Some other examples include: Augenlos (one eye), Dunn (very thin), Laut (loud voice), Stark (Strong).</p>\n<h3>Dwarf Names</h3>\n<p>Dwarf names are comprised of a forename, a surname, and a clan name.</p>\n<h4>Dwarf Forenames</h4>\n<p>Dwarf names tend to be short and sturdy like the people they represent, and are most commonly given to celebrate important ancestors, although individual clan traditions vary. Another common practice is to use a birthname to describe a key trait of a newborn in Khazalid, the Dwarf native language.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Alrik, Bronda, Dimzad, Fenna, Gottri, Gudrun, Snorri.</p>\n<p><strong>Khazalid examples</strong>: Baragaz (Cannon Mouth), Durak (Hard), Galazil (Golden Haired), Gnoldok (Wise Eyes), Nazril (Shimmering), Okri (Crafter)</p>\n<h4>Dwarf Surnames</h4>\n<p>Dwarf surnames are based on who raised the Dwarf, with the following suffixes the most common in use: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>sdottir: Daughter of…</li>\n<li>snev: Nephew of…</li>\n<li>sniz: Niece of…</li>\n<li>sson: Son of…</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Ariksson, Grunnasdottir, Skagnev, Sovrissniz</p>\n<p>It’s common as Dwarfs age and accrue deeds to their names to adopt a nickname based on physical appearance, prowess, or deed. These are usually bestowed by clan consensus, and it’s considered dishonourable to give a name that doesn’t represent the true character of a Dwarf. If such a nickname is adopted, it usually replaces the surname completely. So, Gerka Kardadottir would become Gerka Blackhand if she took the nickname ‘Blackhand’. Sometimes a nickname is marked in Khazalid, but Dwarfs usually translate such to Reikspiel in order to better explain themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Axebringer, Finehand, Forkbeard, Ironbraid, Redhammer, Stonefist</p>\n<h4>Clan Name</h4>\n<p>Finally, all Dwarfs bear a Clan Name (assuming they have not abandoned Dwarf tradition, which some Dwarfs living in the Empire have, especially rogue engineers). The Clan Name is always derived from the ancestor who founded the Clan, and is often sourced in a Nickname, often expressed in Khazalid. In practice, Dwarfs rarely use their Clan Name outside Dwarf society.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Reikland Clans</strong>: Ardrungan, Bryntok, Gazani, Gromheld, Harrazlings, Unboki</p>\n<p><strong>Common Grey Mountain Clans</strong>: Dokkintroll, Ganvalgger, Kvitang, Thrungtak, Wyrgrinti, Zankonk</p>\n<h4>Elf Names</h4>\n<p>Elves normally only admit to having names comprising of a forename and an epithet when wandering the Reikland.</p>\n<p><strong>Elf Forenames</strong></p>\n<p>The Elves use a naming system quite incomprehensible to outsiders. Eltharin (the common language of High Elves and Wood Elves, which has many dialects) is a language that relies on more than simple syllables to convey meaning. The easiest way to create an Elf name is to use the Elf Name Generator.</p>\n<p><strong>Elf Epithets</strong></p>\n<p>When travelling foreign lands, Elves typically present themselves with a forename and an epithet rather than attempt to explain the deeper concepts of Kindreds, Kinbands, or Houses. These epithets are always translated into Reikspiel as they are much easier for other species to pronounce and understand. Among High Elves, epithets usually describe character traits and physical appearance, but can be more obscure. Wood Elf epithets typically reference the natural world so beloved by the forest kin.</p>\n<p><strong>High Elf examples</strong>: Emberfell, Fireborn, Foamheart, Goldenhair, Silverspray, Spellsign</p>\n<p><strong>Wood Elf examples</strong>: Fleetriver, Shadowstalker, Treeshaper, Weavewatcher, Willowlimb, Windrunner</p>\n<h4>Halfling Names</h4>\n<p>Halfling names are comprised of a given name and a clan name at a minimum, with middle names included to ensure family trees are not confused.</p>\n<p><strong>Halfling Forenames</strong></p>\n<p>Halflings proudly bear grand names drawn from their long family trees, but they rarely use these outside official business. Normally, they are known by a cosy-sounding shortened form of their ancestral name. Some Halfling’s diminutives are completely unrelated to their formal names and are instead more descriptive, like Rosie or Scrumper. </p>\n<p>Halflings place great stock in their achievements and some elders will only answer to nicknames related to their job, such as Gaffer, Guv, or Nan. Halflings also have long had a habit of emulating their neighbours to the point that many grand, formerly-Human names have now become ‘traditional’ Halfling names. </p>\n<p><strong>Examples (with diminutives)</strong>: Antoniella (Anni), Esmerelda (Esme), Ferdinand (Fred), Heironymus (Hiro), Maximilian (Max), Theodosius (Theo), Thomasina (Tina)</p>\n<h4>Halfling Clan Names</h4>\n<p>Halfling clan names are almost exclusively related to food and drink, geographical or natural features, or personal characteristics of the ancestor who first took the name. Halflings who have the same surname are always related and can usually tell you exactly how. </p>\n<p>Human’s tendency to have the same surname despite being unrelated causes confusion among some Halflings, who will happily pinch pies from a Schmidt on one street because a Schmidt on another street short-changed them. </p>\n<p><strong>Common Reikland Clans</strong>: Ashfield, Brandysnap, Hayfoot, Rumster, Shortbottom, Thorncobble</p>\n<h3>Physical Details</h3>\n<p>When it comes to cosmetic physical details — those aspects of your appearance that don’t influence the game directly — you may either roll them randomly or choose from the range available to your Species. </p>\n<h4>Age</h4>\n<p>Average natural lifespans are around 60 for a Human, 120 for Halflings, and over 200 for a Dwarf, while Elves don’t appear to age at all and have been known to live for a thousand years or more. Choose your Character’s age or use the /char command.</p>\n<h4>Eye Colour</h4>\n<p>While most species roll once on the table below, Elves may roll twice: their innately magical natures mean they often have variegated colours, such as sapphire blue flecked with gold, or a mottled mixture of mossy green and warm chestnut.</p>\n<p>@Table[eyes]</p>\n<h4>Hair Colour</h4>\n<p>All species barring Elves have hair that slowly turns grey as they move through middle age, then eventually turns white as they reach old age. </p>\n<p>By comparison, Elves seem eternally youthful, never showing any signs of age. Humans and Dwarfs may also have significant facial hair, which is usually the same colour as head hair, but not always.</p>\n<p>@Table[hair]</p>\n<h4>Height</h4>\n<p>Average heights are: Dwarf (4’8”), Elf (6’5”), Halfling (3’6”), with Humans varying much more widely, averaging somewhere around 5’9” in the Reikland. If you want a truly random upper height for Humans, if either die rolls a 10, roll one more die and add it to the height total.</p>\n<p>Use /char to generate height.</p>\n<h3>Ambitions</h3>\n<p>Ambitions are a Character’s goals in life – what they want to achieve. All characters have both a Short-Term and Long-Term Ambition. </p>\n<h4>Choosing Ambitions</h4>\n<p>Consult with your GM when choosing your Ambitions. Your GM has final say on the acceptability of an Ambition, and whether it is short-term or long-term. Should you wish to change an Ambition, you may do so between sessions. </p>\n<h4>Short-term Ambitions</h4>\n<p>Short-term Ambitions represent your immediate goals. They are outcomes you wish to achieve within days and weeks, possibly sooner. Under normal circumstances, a short-term Ambition should take at least two or three sessions to complete.</p>\n<p>Example short-term Ambitions include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ruining the reputation of a romantic rival.</li>\n<li>Avenging a fallen comrade.</li>\n<li>Befriending a reclusive scholar. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Long-term Ambitions</h4>\n<p>Long-term Ambitions are goals you will need to work on for months or years to complete, and may never be achieved at all, perhaps taken more as a description of a primary motivation in your life than a realistic outcome.</p>\n<p>Examples of long-term Ambitions include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Owning your own coaching inn.</li>\n<li>Building your village into a thriving town.</li>\n<li>Ridding the Colleges of Magic of Elven influence. </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Nefarious Plans</em></h3>\n<p><em>You may want to keep your Ambitions secret from other players in your party, especially if they are controversial or clandestine. If you want to overthrow the Emperor, or legalise Necromancy in the Reikland, chances are your Witch Hunter ally won’t approve!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Achieving Your Ambitions</h4>\n<p>If you achieve your short-term Ambition, you will receive a bonus of +50 XP, and can choose a new short-term Ambition at the end of the session.  If you achieve your long-term Ambition, you may either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receive a bonus of +500 XP and choose a new long-term Ambition at the end of the session. </li>\n<li>Retire your Character — who becomes an NPC under your GM’s control — and gain a bonus of half your earned XP of your current character to spend on your next character.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Retired Characters will generally stay in place to take advantage of their achieved ambition. You can build them into the background of your new Character, so that they may continue to help you. If you want to reactivate a retired Character, talk to your GM about how best to bring that into the current story. Retiring Characters allows you to build a network across the Old World, and can be a great source of adventure leads. </p>","folder":"Q0UfttGS2ZpKyqfG","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Character"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Character","sort":100001}}}

A landslide might render a surface route impassable, and every year more underground territory is lost to the greenskins, or a once-safe bridge is torn down by the relentless gnawing of the Raki. It is the duty of the Karak Ranger to patrol these routes and keep them safe, or establish new paths where an old one has become too dangerous.</p>\n<p>A Karak Ranger&rsquo;s survival hinges on preparedness; there is little company or comfort to be found along the ancient dark tunnels or secret mountain passes, and even less chance of help should he encounter danger. One must be prepared to leap large chasms, climb sheer surfaces, or cross large bodies of water (or sewage, or even lava), depending on the route. Every bush, every shadow, may contain dangers, waiting to pounce. A Karak Ranger must be tough and adaptable to survive, by turns able to hunt, scout, and fight, or even repair a bridge mid-expedition.</p>\n<p>Karak Rangers often spend many months in the field, far away from civilisation. Where human or halfling rangers are often seen by society as becoming wild like nature itself (most dwarves believe elves were always uncivilised tree-lovers), a Karak Ranger remains true to his people; The mountains are brutal and unforgiving, and to live in &ldquo;harmony&rdquo; with them would be to abandon one&rsquo;s traditions and clan, an unthinkable prospect. Karak Rangers seek to tame the wilds, not submit to them. Some Rangers train animal companions such as dogs, birds of prey or even hardy mountain goats, both for company and aid in scouting and hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Dwarf</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Ranger</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Karak Ranger Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"height: 34px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 60px; text-align: center;\">WS</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 60px; text-align: center;\">BS</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 60px; text-align: center;\">S</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">T</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">I</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">Agi</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">Dex</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">Int</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">WP</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">Fel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 60px; text-align: center;\">I</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 60px; text-align: center;\">II</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 60px; text-align: center;\">I</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">I</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">III</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">IV</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px; width: 61px; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><strong>I. @Item[amIGaZ8f8VDB60FB]{Hold Runner}</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>II. @Item[dMGX6fWlht9e5RK7]{Karak Ranger}</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>III. @Item[w05Ao3Z3Wkwgva84]{Karak Pathkeeper}</strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>IV. @Item[8swVVRU1WcWa8EYt]{Karak Mountain Strider}</strong></h3>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/artisan.webp"}

Moderate influence (2 votes).</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Lives in the Outer Palace, but attends many Carnival events. In public she is accompanied by at least one other Lady at Court, a major NPC, or a senior member of the City Guard. She likes wining, dining, and dancing at high-class hostelries, informal theatrical events, and occasional modest gambling.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Characters without the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (Nobles or Servants)} Talent</strong>: –10 to Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Elves</strong>: +5 to Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Emmanuelle knows who has influence with the Graf. She also knows that he has been in a decline and increasingly follows the majority opinion. She is afraid of losing her position if she tries to influence political affairs, so she does not pry into matters of state, and does not know who is behind the taxes. She does know that now the tax changes have been enacted, a clear majority among the Graf ’s advisers will be needed to reverse them. She may reveal that the Graf told her that the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} was enthusiastic about the tax changes, while the @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Marshals} and @JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{wizards} argued against them.</p>\n<p>She may recommend @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} as a good source of court gossip. If the Characters are being sympathetic about the blackmail, she will suggest that they talk to Petra just generally, to see what she has heard. She suspects that someone with access to the Inner Palace must have stolen the letters, since there was no sign of a break-in.</p>\n<p>Emmanuelle may reveal that @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} has made advances to her if this seems relevant: she has not told @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} of this. From his talk about about illict herbs, she suspects the ‘Doktor’ is the worst kind of <em>bon vivant</em>. If the Characters know (or suspect) about the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor’s} addiction, they may falsely suspect Luigi of being his supplier.</p>\n<p>Emmanuelle is important because of her influence on @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris}, and her knowledge of who else influences him. The Characters should work hard and carefully to win her trust.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>None. Through talking with Graf Boris she knows who influences him, and how much.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Normally an avid seeker of wealth and position, Emmanuelle is concerned only with getting her neck out of the blackmail noose. She has considered fleeing Middenheim, but feels some guilt about leaving @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} to face the music alone. However, she will overcome this scruple if nothing changes soon. If the Characters mention blackmail, she may panic and flee — unless Ar-Ulric has already warned her that they are investigating the matter. In that case, everything depends on her assessment of the Characters: if confident, she will give them her full cooperation; otherwise, she will gather her valuables and flee at the first opportunity.</p>\n<p>If Emmanuelle flees, Ar-Ulric may panic, Graf Boris may begin an investigation, and @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} will do all he can to find out who has been stirring things up and have them killed (see ‘@JournalEntry[jepWFu96Qh64OlHw]{Pawns of the Evil Wizard},’). The Characters may have to pursue her and bring her back by force — but only if the adventure is progressing exceptionally well and a few days’ delay will not guarantee failure. Otherwise, let her stay in Middenheim and be as helpful as the Characters’ diplomacy warrants. She will only use her influence to support the Characters if the blackmail letters are recovered, and if they clearly have other supporters in court circles.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Loathes his stiff formality and insults him with backhanded compliments.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Knows him only from Kirsten Jung’s comments and from infrequent meetings. Thinks him kindly, strong, and attractive, but dull.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Fast friends and platonic companions, even after their brief affair four years ago. She has not told him of her affair with Ar-Ulric, and thinks him too trusting to suspect; she knows how he idealises females.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — the ‘Princess’:</strong> Resents her disdain for all the Ladies at Court. Has persuaded the Graf not to meet Katarina in her presence, to spare the ‘Princess’s’ feelings.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: Returns Hildegarde’s open contempt with hatred, and would love the chance to cut her down.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: No strong feelings. Schutzmann is a former lover, although they do not meet now. Knows that Von Genscher’s son, Anton, is having a sporadic affair with Petra Liebkosen. Thinks that von Genscher is a fine figure of a man.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Indifferent; no dealings.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Given her appetites and the Graf ’s decline, Emmanuelle was always likely to take another. Ar-Ulric is attentive, wealthy, and — given his position — guaranteed to be discreet. Emmanuelle is genuinely fond of him, but feels superior: less gullible, and tougher.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: She thinks Kirsten Jung kindly and good-natured, but a little prim. She dislikes Natasha because of  her haughty and condescending demeanour. She is perhaps closest to Petra Liebkosen, since their personalities are broadly similar — but worried that the gossip-loving Petra may unintentionally have helped the blackmailer.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Avoids him, but insults him behind his back for his lack of worldly intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: A long-time friend, Allavandrel introduced Emmanuelle to a theatrical contact, which led to her first acting break. The Elf is an amusing and trustworthy companion, and although they have never had an affair, they did share an occasional night of passion before Emmanuelle landed the Graf.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Despises him: he tried to buy her favours before she became a Lady at Court. Will take any opportunity to spread rumours about his business dealings, and his personal pleasures.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Alarmed by some quite explicit advances he made to her, she avoids him. Luigi made references to certain treatments he knew of that can enhance masculine fervor marvellously, which left Emanuelle too shocked to reply.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Has heard of them through Ar-Ulric, but does not know any of them personally. She thinks of them as capable men, who do their job well enough.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer: </strong>Schlagen remembers Rothbert as someone who occasionally hung around with her old theatrical friends. She’s wary of spending time with anyone associated with that time in her life. While she enjoyed it, she’s moved on.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Emmanuelle never liked Breugal, finding his manner off-putting while simultaneously hating herself for caring so much about what he might be thinking and searching for any signs that he is judging her. At first, she was afraid he knew about her involvement with the Graf; now, she worries that he might know about her affair with @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}. She avoids the chamberlain whenever she can.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Schlagen dislikes the High Priestess’s attitude and has wondered whether she is behind the blackmail letters.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>Considers her naive and distrusts anyone so apparently idealistic. She believes that Katarina confides important secrets to Isolde, which is not true but feels plausible.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Gymnasts}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Recitals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Lightsingers}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Flying Displays}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Water Polo Tournament}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<h3>Emmanuelle at the Carnival</h3>\n<p>Like the other ladies-at-court, Emmanuelle can be encountered at a number of Carnival events, although she is busy escorting visiting dignitaries and not generally available to talk. The Characters can make a good impression on her in passing, perhaps by dealing with a disturbance that threatens her safety or that of her charge, or just the reputation of the city in the eyes of a distinguished visitor.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have already made a good impression on @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} or @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen}, and proved themselves discreet and trustworthy, they might be introduced to Emmanuelle as people who could help with whatever has been making Emmanuelle so depressed lately.

It was sung to accompany a game in which one child, the Witch Hunter, chased others. Those the Witch Hunter caught joined the chase.

They were remarkable in two ways. Firstly they regularly made gifts of their booty to those most burdened by Beatrice's taxes. Secondly, whilst most of the outlaws were fully&nbsp;human, Max and his closest henchmen were&nbsp;mutants. For four years Max avoided the authorities, and became something of a local hero. However, his luck did not hold out forever. He was captured and taken to&nbsp;Altdorf&nbsp;for torture and execution. His horned head graced a spike on Altdorf's east gate as a warning against mutation and banditry for many years.</p>\n<p>In the time of&nbsp;Magnus the Pious&nbsp;the moral guardians of Altdorf tried to alter the meaning of the game and song, to imply that the chaser was a mutant who&nbsp;corrupted&nbsp;those he caught. This new version did not catch on, so a by-law was passed to the effect that anyone found playing the game or singing the song would be flogged.</p>\n<p>Max remained a popular boy's name in the town of Teufelfeuer until the turn of the millennium.</p>"}

{"_id":"zX6Bk4D4WLlCOZxF","name":"Isolde Begegnen - High Matriarch","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/isolde-begegnen.webp\" width=\"284\" height=\"292\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>Begegnen has an important role in Middenheim, as a religious leader and champion for the poor. At the temple, she oversees care for the sick and nurturing the orphans. Like the other high priests, she is consulted in matters of city government, but outside her domain she has little interest in the running of Middenheim.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>The High Matriarch has a small annexe in the temple where she sleeps and lives in contemplation. Begegnen’s cell is small and austere. She rises early to pray and begin a long, arduous day ministering to the sick and those in need. Most of the time she stays in the temple, but she also makes excursions into the @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}, @JournalEntry[y4MpfiD6PHBOAdX0]{Southgate}, and other poor parts of the city.</p>\n<p>From time to time she visits the palace or @JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Physician’s Guild} to meet with those who seek her counsel or support.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>The High Matriarch tries to see the best in others, whoever they are. Everyone starts with a +5 to Fellowship Tests, which is lost if they act or speak cruelly of other Humans, Elves, Dwarfs, or Halflings or dismiss their suffering. Brass Characters also get a permanent +5 to Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Begegnen does not have much insight into who can influence the Graf, but through her relationship with @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} she has realised that the ‘Princess’ is more influential than most would expect.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Other than @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina}, she believes that only the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{Law Lords}, @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}, and @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Midden Marshals} have any real influence on the Graf ’s decisions.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>The High Matriarch wants the tax to be repealed and will lobby to ensure this happens. She also seeks increased support for the Temple’s good works and improved sanitation in the poor parts of the city. She wants the @JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Physician’s Guild} to pay greater respects to Shallya and less to gold. Finally, she wants to know what made Ar-Ulric back the tax, as it seems to make no sense.</p>\n<h3>Influence</h3>\n<p>The High Matriarch has an active dislike of politics and dislikes those who deal in it. As such, she has no influence on the Graf.</p>\n<h3>Pressure Points</h3>\n<p>Begegnen founded the temple’s orphanage and school herself and she is very protective of the institution and its charges. If @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} were to threaten either the children or the reputation of the temple, she would become reluctant to support anyone trying to bring down the tax or investigate the conspiracy in the city.</p>\n<h2>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</h2>\n<p>She may disdain politics, but Isolde Begegnen is well connected in Middenheim.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>Begegnen has had dealings with many of the major NPCs.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: The High Matriarch has faint disapproval for the Chancellor, complaining that he knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmeidehammer} – Champion</strong>: Schmeidehammer has been known to donate to the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya}, so she holds him in some regard. She learned recently that he’d supported the taxes and was very surprised, more baffled than angry with him. It is very out of character and she wonders whether he has been bewitched.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: Although he brings joy to those around him, Begegnen finds Rallane too flippant.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: The High Matriarch has a very favourable view of Katarina, as the ‘Princess’ is a patron of the Cult of Shallya. The two have become formal but cordial acquaintances and the High Matriarch has offered some guidance to Katarina. She has also discovered that Katarina is more perceptive and intelligent than first impressions suggest. If Begegnen trusts the party and they can convince her of their noble intentions, she may be able to arrange a meeting with Katarina.  </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: They have a strained but respectful relationship — she believes that Zimperlich means well, but finds her snobbery and rigid morality difficult to tolerate.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: She has no real involvement with them.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Although the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Wizards Guild} has several supporters of the cult, the High Matriarch finds Helseher too detached from the real world. She understands that Eberhauer is a good person, but has had no dealings with her personally.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Before the new taxes, the High Matriarch had a good relationship with Ar-Ulric and she appreciated his insight and wisdom in religious matters. Ulricans and Shallyans are often at odds elsewhere in the Empire, but in Middenheim relations were relatively harmonious. This changed with Ar-Ulric’s support for the taxes. She is furious at his betrayal and struggles to reconcile her forgiving faith with her anger. She’s petitioned him, but noticed that he seems distracted and conflicted. If the party discover and explain his situation, she feels deep sympathy and help them by arranging a meeting with Ar-Ulric. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: She has no dealings with them, other than Kirsten who is a follower of Shallya. They are well-acquainted and the priestess supports her relationship with @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}. In a recent conversation with Kirsten she was surprised to hear that he had supported the tax.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} – Knight Eternal</strong>: No real dealings with him. She is occasionally forced to deal with orphans who have mocked him in the street. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: She believes that he’s a decent Elf, but sometimes gets the impression that Elves in the city look down on the Human pantheon.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: He donates to the orphanage anonymously, but Isolde discovered this and was quite surprised. She mentioned it to some of her subordinates and it’s becoming more widely-known… just as Wittgenstein planned.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: Pavarotti has not visited the temple, and Isolde is not impressed. As a physician, she would expect him to pay homage to the patron goddess of healing. She has petitioned the @JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Middenheim Physicians Guild} to investigate whether he is a fraud.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: She had a close relationship with Ehrlich, whose care for the poor made him a supporter of the cult. She’s worried that he seemed depressed last time he visited the temple. No dealings with the other two.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Despite her piety, the High Matriarch attends the Carnival to enjoy the more genteel entertainments.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Opera The Barbarian of Seville}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Pageant of Mummers}; @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{the Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Druidic life sculptures}; @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Elven lightsingers}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Black Pool Illuminations}</p>","folder":"hQfHL1VS2zKPRt1T","sort":900000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":900000}}}

{"_id":"zjcDY0QAa0NWiDBs","name":"Travel","content":"<p>Travelling in the Old World can be dangerous. Brigands, mutants, and beasts lurk in the shadows, an ever-present threat, perhaps joined by those specifically out to thwart the Players’ actions. Some parts of the Empire have been corrupted by magic, Chaos, Necromancy, or worse, and can easily consume the unwary traveller. Even the weather poses a threat!</p>\n<p>It’s up to you how you want to represent the dangers of travel in your game. Sometimes you’ll just want to get on with the adventure and deal with journeys with a simple description of how long the journey was, and the key points along the way. Most journeys will either be by road or by river, with road the more dangerous, and cheaper, option.</p>\n<h4>Travel by Road</h4>\n<p>The roads of the Reikland are often crude but reliable. The routes between major cities are relatively safe and well-maintained. However, far-flung routes can be little more than muddy tracks. Regardless of the quality, all roads need to be maintained, so most are tolled.</p>\n<p>There is an extensive network of coach routes throughout the province. The busiest routes have coaches running several times per day. The many Coaching Houses of the Reikland are in fierce competition, so the prices are often reasonable and reliability is good. The Four Seasons is the biggest coach company, and is represented along all the major routes.</p>\n<p>Roadside inns are often placed at the convenience of the Coaching Houses. Therefore, journeying by foot, especially away from the major routes, runs the risk of not reaching a safe place to rest before nightfall.</p>\n<h4>Travel by River</h4>\n<p>River journeys are often straightforward and perhaps even relaxing. However, this relies on finding a boat going to and from convenient locations. Dedicated passenger barges only travel between the major towns and cities, but can be bribed or persuaded to drop people off along the way. Getting to more obscure locations usually requires hitching a ride with a cargo boat, which can be difficult for large parties.</p>\n<h4>Travel Prices</h4>\n<p>The prices listed in Travel Costs do not include meals, lodging, or fodder, although coaches and passenger boats usually charge for the whole package for longer journeys. Package prices can be worked out by combining travel with food and boarding prices. On some ferries, lodging is not required, as passengers sleep on the vessel, either on deck or in a private cabin.</p>\n<p>Cargo barge travel-costs should be individually haggled with barge masters. Often, such passage can be secured for a greatly reduced price, or even for free, if the passenger is willing to work and they know what they’re doing.</p>\n<p>High class travel is available and de rigueur among the nobility, and can cost many times the listed price, typically ten times or more. Opulent passenger vessels ply between the great cities of the Empire, like the famous Emperor Luitpold plying the River Talebec between Altdorf and Talabheim.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Travel Costs</span></h3>\n<p><em>All the costs listed here are per mile travelled, and are loose guides only. Faster coaches and barges generally cost twice as much. Slower examples cost as little as half as much. Increase or decrease speed by +/– 1 for faster or slower examples. </em></p>\n<table style=\"height:153px;width:367px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\">\n<h4><strong><em>Transport</em></strong></h4>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\">\n<h4><strong><em>Movement</em></strong></h4>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\">\n<h4><strong><em>Cost</em></strong></h4>\n</td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\">\n<h4><strong><em>Distance</em></strong></h4>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>COACH</strong></em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>6</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em>Inside</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[2bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em>Outside</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[1bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>BARGE</strong></em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>8</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em>Cabin</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[5bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em>Deck</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[2bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>CAB</strong></em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>6</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[3bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per district</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>FERRY</strong></em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>4</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[1bp]</em></td>\n<td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per 20 yards</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Travel Times</h4>\n<p>Use Movement to determine travel speed in miles per hour. So, if a party’s slowest Movement was 3, it would travel at approximately 3 miles per hour. </p>\n<p>Taking into account rests, necessary stops, and a typical topography, a party can travel the equivalent of 6 hours a day without requiring Endurance Tests. If travelling faster or farther, give a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition to those failing this Test, with extra Fatigue if Encumbered.</p>\n<p>Barge speed can increase or decrease by up to 30% if going downstream or upstream, as you determine is appropriate.</p>\n<h4>Travel Events</h4>\n<p>Whether detailing daily travel or simply choosing to allow the party to pay an appropriate fee and then arrive at their chosen destination, every now and again it’s good to throw in some travel events. It’s an opportunity to show off a different aspect of the Old World, or to give a change of pace to the adventure. </p>\n<p>An intrigue-focused game can sometimes do with a clearly defined ‘goodies vs. baddies’ Beastmen attack. A tense, bleak session can benefit from a night’s entertainment sharing camp with a travelling circus. Further, you can work these encounters into your ongoing narrative if you wish. </p>\n<p>Finding the burned-out caravans of the circus later in the journey is a poignant way of making the antagonists’ actions personal. Travel events are also great for foreshadowing events to come, or reinforcing the themes of an adventure. </p>\n<p>It is up to you how much of an issue you want these travel events to be for your players. Some could simply consist of a brief description, while others could form the basis of an entire session of play. Some GMs prefer to roll [[/gmr 1d10]] per day of travel and have an event occur on the roll of an 8 (signifying the 8-pointed symbol of Chaos — something unexpected and random has occurred), others like a single event for each journey of a day or more. This is left for you to determine, though if you are playing a printed adventure by <strong>Cubicle 7</strong> that includes a journey, suggested events and travel times will be included. So, @Table[travel] can be used as you prefer, and presumes a single event for the journey travelled.</p>\n<p>You might like to give Players the opportunity to avoid nasty events with a successful Perception Test, or Outdoor Survival, or whatever other Test makes sense at the time. If they are travelling in paid-for transportation, you might decide that gives them help in overcoming any adversities. </p>","folder":"KBFMpqeeMFWhdpSI","sort":1200001,"permission":{"default":2,"uZJKPuqDv0BBLk9c":3,"VnnpieLwbiAu3Owf":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"},"wfrp4e-core":{"initialization-folder":"Rules","sort":1200001}}}
{"_id":"zm2zG5Tw0uj9H3ao","name":"The Powers That Be","content":"<p>This adventure requires the Characters to make the acquaintance of various figures in the upper echelons of Middenheim’s society, uncover the evil plot that has prompted the new taxes, and bring influence to bear on the Graf: both to repeal the taxes, and to deal with the plot’s architect.</p>\n<p>This chapter falls into three sections. The first part covers the information that the Characters can discover from various sources, which should lead them to conclude that they need to make the acquaintance of one or more major NPCs. The second part deals with meeting the major NPCs themselves, and beginning to unravel the evil plot. The third part presents a series of events and encounters that take place independently, regardless of where the Characters are in their investigations.</p>\n<h2>Encountering NPCS</h2>\n<p>Once the Characters have made some initial enquiries and realised that something strange is going on, you  can use one or more of these events to start the main part of the adventure. In most cases, the Characters cannot initiate these events, though they can react to them as they choose.</p>\n<p>The outcome of the first encounter with a particular NPC  sets the tone of any future interaction. The Characters must decide how best to approach each NPC, and there are a number of ways of doing so.</p>\n<p>The first is via official channels. Many of the NPCs have functions connected with the running of the City. Theoretically they should be accessible to anyone with a valid interest in their particular job. In practice, official channels may result in an appointment in 2–11 days’ time ([[/r 1d10+1]]), which is probably too late to achieve the party’s goals.</p>\n<p>The second method is to bump into the NPC in a social setting or at a Carnival event: at the opera, for example, or the Archery Tournament. This is both quicker and simpler, since it does not require an appointment or a cover story. Various GM aids (see <strong>Keeping Track</strong>, below) are provided which list the major NPCs’ movements  during Carnival week.</p>\n<p>The Characters can also meet some NPCs through sheer chance as they move around the city. (A few examples are given below.) Such chance encounters can help enliven an unproductive session of play, but they must be used sparingly, so the Players do not feel they can passively wait for the answers to come to them. Some NPCs, like the @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Graf ’s Champion}, are very easy to come across around the city, and do not need specially-designed ‘chance encounters.’</p>\n<p>The Locations section of an NPC Sheet tells where the NPC lives and how he or she can be encountered. The party must find this information out for themselves, but it should not be too difficult to do so: any Middenheimer ‘in the know’ able to tell the party — or at least, to make a shrewd guess — which NPCs will attend which events, and where they are likely to be found at other times. This is Middenheim’s celebrity gossip, after all.</p>\n<p>For example, Chancellor @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} is an ardent collector of antiques. An NPC merchant might boast of having him as a customer, which might give the party the chance to meet him as he looks over some item or other in a place off the beaten track. The following pages suggest various means by which the party can encounter each of the major NPCs.</p>\n<p>However, it is one thing to encounter an NPC, and quite another to engineer a meeting. For example, the @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Court Minstrel}, @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Graf ’s Champion}, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Master of the Hunt}, and the Ladies-at-Court are fairly easily encountered, but they are usually surrounded by an entourage of admirers, flunkeys, drinking companions, and friends — not to mention bodyguards whose job is to keep the riff-raff at bay.</p>\n<p>The exact composition of an entourage varies with the circumstances — the ‘Princess’ may be surrounded by the Town Guard on a walkabout, but her box at the Royal Opera House holds a much smaller group of close friends. Details must be improvised according to the encounter. The Standard NPC sheet covers minor NPCs of various sorts, which can be used as required.</p>\n<p>There is always the chance that the Characters might not recognise an NPC at the first encounter. For example, @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}, Chairman of the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}, dresses much like any other merchant, and may not seem particularly important if casually encountered in a tavern. If the Characters have a precise description of an NPC’s appearance, of course, that’s another matter!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>KEEPING TRACK</em></h3>\n<p><em>When running this adventure, you (the GM) need to know where every one of the 22 major NPCs is at any time, and also which major NPCs, if any, are in the same location as the Player Characters. At the back of this book are 15 NPC sheets, 21 NPC cards, one master NPC card, and a master attractions chart.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE NPC SHEETS AND CARDS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Detailed information on each major NPC or group of NPCs is found on the NPC Summary Sheets. The NPC sheets include profiles and descriptions for each NPC and summarise each one’s role at court, what they know, who they know, and what they think of them. The NPC cards give each character’s schedule for Carnival week. An NPC will attend the listed events unless there is a very good reason not to do so. If an NPC is listed as participating at an event it may be impossible to convince them to break such a commitment.</em></p>\n<p><em>The listing only covers major Carnival events. Whenever the NPC is not listed as being anywhere in particular, you may pencil in some other location and/or activity. With a few exceptions, the NPCs may be willing to change some of their plans to help the Characters out — but only if they are convinced that it is essential. Remember to update the Master Attractions Calendar as well as the individual NPC card.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE AQUAINTANCES &amp; </em><em>MACHINATIONS OF THE </em><em>COURT OF MIDDENHEIM</em></h3>\n<p><em>This two page spread summarises each NPC’s role, both at the Court and in the adventure, including ‘influence votes’ with the Graf, and other important relationships. NPCs are grouped according to social or political allegiance where possible. This chart should never be seen by players, as even a glance can spoil the plot.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE MASTER </em><em>ATTRACTIONS CALENDAR</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Master Attractions Folder shows when and where each Carnival event occurts, and which NPCs will be in attendance. Each day consists of a section on parchment which shows the time and location of each event. This section may be freely shared with players, as this information is widely available and many Middenheimers will have it memorised. The section not printed on parchment is for GM use only, and shows which NPCs are in attendance. While Characters may learn of some NPCs plans with ease, such as Dieters attendance at Challenges to the Grafs Champion, the schedules of important court officials are not generally shared publically. </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Dropping By</h3>\n<p>At home, an NPC is  protected by guards and servants, such as butlers and valets, who try to ensure that no one sees their master or mistress without an appointment, or at least without good cause. Some may  refuse to help the Characters simply to emphasise their own rank and position. Faced with an unyielding lackey, the Characters have various options.</p>\n<h4>Bribery</h4>\n<p>These are elite servants, and bribery attempts are more likely to offend them than persuade them to admit the Characters: all <strong>Bribery </strong>Tests should be at least <strong>Difficult (–10)</strong> and potentially <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong> to reflect this.  The difficulty should reflect your estimation of the NPCs initial attitude toward the Characters. Failure is likely to result in physical ejection from the premises, or even a call for the Watch.</p>\n<p>The roll should also be adjusted according to what the Characters are asking. It difficult to see a major NPC at home without an invitation or appointment, but if the Characters only want to know whether the NPC will be attending a certain event — something that is already public knowledge, or close to it, and something which, if asked later, the NPC can deny — the chances are far better. Remember that, regardless of the roll, no NPC is likely to do anything too stupid or ridiclous, especially if it would put their own position at risk.</p>\n<h4>Bluff</h4>\n<p>A less risky way of getting past servants is to bluff. The servant does not automatically know whether someone is lying, and if the lie seems convincing enough, it becomes more than the servant’s job’s worth to turn the Character away. What if he really is the Padishah Emperor of all Araby?</p>\n<p>Of course, the Characters should do more than simply arrive and hope for a successful <strong>Charm </strong>Test. They should look and speak the part, perhaps having ‘servants’ of their own to announce them. The appropriate @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette} Talent (Servants, Nobility, or Guilder)  informs a Character how best to approach them.</p>\n<p>To see @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor Sparsam}, for example, the party might use his interest in antiques by posing as merchants or fellow collectors. Once they are talking to the Chancellor, they can shift the conversation to the new tax laws — assuming, of course, that they do know something about antiques: bluffing Sparsam is far harder than bluffing his servants.</p>\n<h4>Gossip</h4>\n<p>Finally, the party might simply talk with a servant as an end in itself, especially in the early part of the adventure, when they are fishing for clues. While a successful Gossip Test might let a Character know how to approach this, make sure to let them roleplay the situation themselves, as this can be far more entertaining.</p>\n<p>For example, the Chancellor’s butler could be approached in the following manner: <em>‘Excuse me, but your master appeared a little unwell. Perhaps I’m wrong, but I wondered — probably foolishly — whether some help might not be solicited. I myself know a little about medical matters.’ </em>Faced with such concern and politeness, the butler probably won’t take offence — although whether he agrees with the Character is something else. Having buttered up the butler in this way, the Character might come back in a day or two to enquire further about the Chancellor’s health, and perhaps the butler might mention the visits of a certain lady...</p>\n<h3>Good Manners</h3>\n<p>The main reason for the Characters to seek out the major NPCs is to learn as much as they can about the tax changes, but in court circles one does not simply collar people and demand to know if they used their influence on the Graf for one thing or another.</p>\n<p>If the players do not realise this for themselves, a helpful NPC can tell them that one must be polite and tactful about such matters. Although a number of the NPCs are anxious about their positions, they won’t take rudeness or violence from total strangers lightly. The Watch is more than happy to oblige these prominent citizens by making inconvenient out-of-towners go away.</p>\n<h3>The Carnival</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[YPpM7Pg44EgT2yt5]{The Carnival} offers plentiful opportunities for the Characters to encounter members of the city’s elite, and if things are not going their way, then chance – or rather, you – can put other opportunities in their way. There are many ways to achieve this of course, and you should let the players find their own way, responding to the Characters’ actions as appropriate: still, the following notes may prove useful if the Players find themselves at a loss.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/sparsam-flees.webp","folder":"9nJ4brecw2MRO3vH","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":100000}}}
