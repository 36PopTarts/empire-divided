The following covers some of the more common other ways you can receive Damage during play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Drowning and Suffocation</h4>\n<p>If prepared, you can hold your breath for Toughness Bonus x 10 seconds without a Test. After that, you may start to suffocate or drown. If you are unprepared and suddenly deprived of air, you will start to suffocate immediately.</p>\n<p>Each Round you are being suffocated you lose 1 Wound. Should you reach 0 Wounds, you immediately receive the @Condition[Unconscious] Condition. After that, you will die of suffocation or drowning in Toughness Bonus Rounds.</p>\n<h4>Exposure</h4>\n<p>Every 4 hours spent in a difficult environment — such as sub-zero temperatures, a hot desert, or a howling storm — requires you take an Endurance Test. Extreme environments require a Test every 2 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Cold</strong>: Your first failure causes a penalty of –10 Ballistic Skill, Agility and Dexterity. The second failure reduces all other Characteristics by –10. Third and subsequent failures cause [[/r 1d10]] Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost. If you reach zero Wounds, you immediately take an @Condition[Unconscious] condition. Certain Trappings provide bonuses and penalties to these Tests. See pages @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.Ieyr3r0Skl57DkAJ]{Coat} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.IFtoI87gZ4phMHy9]{Bedroll }.</p>\n<p><strong>Heat</strong>: Your first failure causes a penalty of –10 to Intelligence and Willpower, and adds a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition. The second failure reduces all other Characteristics by –10%, and adds another Fatigued Condition. Third and subsequent failures cause [[/r 1d10]] Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost. Stripping off heavy Trappings cancels 1 failed test.</p>\n<h4>Thirst and Starvation</h4>\n<p>Running out of provisions can be bad. Running out of water is worse. Endurance Tests to withstand thirst and hunger become increasingly difficult (cumulative –10 for every test). Characters without food and water cannot heal Wounds or recover Fatigue naturally.</p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong>: Every day without water requires you make an Endurance test. The first failed Test causes a penalty of –10 Intelligence, Willpower, and Fellowship. Second and subsequent failures reduce all Characteristics by –10 and cause 1d10 Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong>: Every 2 days without food require an Endurance Test. The first failed Tests causes a penalty of –10 Strength and Toughness. Second and subsequent failures reduce all other Characteristics by –10 and cause [[/r 1d10]] Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost.</p>"}

To make a ranged attack, your weapon must be in range and your target visible in line-of-sight. For melee attacks, you must be adjacent your target with a weapon ready (see Engaged).</p>\n<h4>1: Roll to Hit</h4>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong>: To attack, perform an Opposed Melee Test with your Opponent (both you and your opponent Test your Melee Skill). Whoever scores the highest SL wins. If you win the Test, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage. If you lose the Opposed Test, your opponent gains +1 Advantage and your Action is finished.</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged</strong>: Roll a Ranged Test for the weapon you’re using. If you are successful, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage. If you fail, your Action is over. Your opponent doesn’t gain Advantage in ranged combat.</p>\n<p>In both melee and ranged Combat, it’s possible to score an impressive hit called a Critical, or to make a mistake, called a Fumble. See Criticals and Fumbles in the section below.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Test to hit your opponent with your weapon. This Test is Opposed in melee. Any winner gains +1 Advantage.</em></p>\n<h4>2: Determine Hit Location</h4>\n<p>If you successfully hit, find out where — reverse the roll to hit and compare this number to the Hit Locations table. So, a roll of 23 to hit would become 32 on the table, a hit on the Right Arm.</p>\n<p>Creatures with different body shapes may use different hit location tables.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong>Location is&nbsp;<strong>not reversed&nbsp;</strong>in Foundry. Instead, an entirely separate dice roll is performed to find the location. Additionally, you can assign a creature a specific hit location table in the configuration menu, accessible by the \"Configure\" button at the top of the sheet</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>3: Determine Damage</h4>\n<p>Once you have determined the hit location, it is time to work out how much Damage you deal. Each weapon has a Weapon Damage characteristic. This is usually your modified Strength Bonus for melee weapons, or a fixed number for ranged weapons. Take the SL of your Opposed Test and add it to the Weapon Damage of the weapon you’re using. This final number is your Damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong><em>: Damage = Weapon Damage + SL</em></p>\n<h4>4: Apply Damage</h4>\n<p>Using the Damage and the Hit Location you struck, you now see how many Wounds your opponent loses from your attack. Subtract your opponent’s Toughness Bonus and any Armour Points protecting the Hit Location from your Damage. The remaining Damage is suffered as Wounds by your opponent. If this is 1 or less, your opponent has shrugged off the worst of the attack and only loses 1 Wound.&nbsp; Should the Wounds lost exceed your opponent’s remaining Wounds total, your opponent takes a Critical Wound (see page 172) and gains the Prone Condition (see page 169).</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Wounds Suffered = Damage – opponent’s (Toughness Bonus + Armour Points)</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Opposing A Melee Attack</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">You can Oppose an incoming melee attack with more than just your Melee Skill. The most obvious choice is Dodge, which allows you to avoid incoming blows, but there are many other Skills that just might be useful in combat, including Intimidate, Charm, Leadership, and more. If your GM thinks it’s appropriate for the situation, and you’re happy missing out on the opportunity to score a Critical Hit against your opponent, then why not give it a go.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Engaged</h4>\n<p>Whenever you attack an opponent, or are attacked, in melee combat, you count as Engaged. This means you are tussling with each other in a fight, and others rules (due to Talents, Spells, etc.) for being Engaged might apply. If you don’t attack each other for a full Round, you are no longer Engaged.</p>","img":"","_id":"0axJFzuRiFgSagii"}

To help with this vital part of roleplaying, we&rsquo;ve outlined goals to follow, and a set of principles to help you choose between multiple courses of action.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The goals and principles are used in similar ways by many roleplaying games to help GMs answer the question &lsquo;<em>What should happen next?</em>&rsquo; These tools are designed to help novice-to-experienced GMs align themselves with <strong>WFRP</strong>, and to think critically about the kind of experience they want their Players to have.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These tools are not prescriptive. If you don&rsquo;t follow them, you&rsquo;re not playing the game &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;. But we encourage you to be open to trying them out &mdash; you may find they suit your group well!</p>\n<p>Lastly, this section details the thematic pillars that hold up Warhammer, and give some guidance on how to accentuate and focus on individual themes over the course of your campaigns.</p>\n<h2>The GM's Goal</h2>\n<p>The following list explains your goal as the GM, beyond that laid out in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. These four points should tell you what you&rsquo;re trying to do, and why. Everything you do as a GM should serve these four goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the Old World come to life</li>\n<li>Create gripping and action-packed&nbsp;scenarios</li>\n<li>Build a story together</li>\n<li>Understand the Characters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Make the Old World Come to Life</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;re there to make the Old World feel real, filled with believable people and places. But the Old World is a weird and often impossible place &mdash; with Beastmen, magic, mutation, and Chaos &mdash; so your job is to ground that in reality. What does it mean to have Second Sight? What is it really like to face a horde of ravening Greenskins?</p>\n<h3>Create Gripping and Action-Packed Scenarios</h3>\n<p>As a GM you&rsquo;re there to inject drama and conflict into the lives of the Characters. You&rsquo;re there to place walls between them and their Ambitions, and to tempt their Motivations with rewards. But Warhammer thrives on the mundane, juxtaposed with the epic. You&rsquo;re there to make injury and illness exciting, to make the quest to afford one more meal, or a roof over one&rsquo;s head, worthwhile.</p>\n<h3>Build A Story Together</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;re there to facilitate group storytelling. You&rsquo;re there to share the spotlight, as evenly as possible, so everyone at the table has the opportunity to contribute. You&rsquo;re not there to script the outcome of any action, but to interpret your Adventure, and the actions of your Characters.</p>\n<h3>Understand the Characters</h3>\n<p>You&rsquo;re there to discover how the Characters are going to get through the challenges you give them. You&rsquo;re there to be surprised and entertained, just like the other Players are! Don&rsquo;t bother writing Adventures with balance or solutions in mind &mdash; in fact, throw your own solutions out the window. Present problems, and let your Players solve them creatively.</p>\n<h2>The GM's Principles</h2>\n<p>The following principles should be a guide: advice on what to do and not do in general. These aren&rsquo;t specific instances of &lsquo;<em>when X happens, do Y&rsquo;,</em> but rather good ways to approach running a game of <strong>WFRP</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reveal the Old World</li>\n<li>Incorporate the Characters</li>\n<li>Embody Uncaring Gods</li>\n<li>Evil is Rampant, Good is Rare 0&nbsp; Focus on the Characters</li>\n<li>Everyone Has a History</li>\n<li>Lead the Players to Their Story 0 Be a Friend, and an Enemy</li>\n<li>Always Advance the Story&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Embrace Conflict</li>\n<li>Be Truthful (to Players)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reveal the Old World</h3>\n<p>The Old World isn&rsquo;t like most fantasy lands. It is full of juxtapositions and conflicts: a middle class rising up from the oppressed peasants under the boot of the tyrannical nobility; the conflicts of doctrine between the preaching, doom-laden churches of the myriad cults; the screaming of babies with empty stomachs, drowned out by the crashing of plate armour, and the beat of drums as the Imperial Army marches by. The Old World is grim, gritty, and largely &mdash; but not entirely &mdash; without hope. Flickers of life, of happiness, and a gallows-humour peek through, which prove the indomitable spirit of Humanity, and shed light on Sigmar&rsquo;s Heirs.</p>\n<p>You should work to cultivate knowledge, not just of the Old World as described in practical terms &mdash; the towns, rivers, forests, and so on &mdash; but also the themes and imagery that make it unique. You should consume media that shows off the glory and tragedy of the Renaissance, and then flood it with monsters, and magic at its edges.</p>\n<h3>Incorporate the Characters</h3>\n<p>Speak directly to the Characters, not the Players. State clearly the information that would be apparent to them. Remember that we, as people, take cues from our world: smells, sounds, the way someone twitches. These cues can be wrong, disguised, or misleading, but we still take them in. The Players should interrogate a scene by using their Character&rsquo;s Skills, but you should be vigilant to give that information up front &mdash; and direct it at the Characters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: &lsquo;Hans, you can tell the woman isn&rsquo;t saying what she truly feels. You can&rsquo;t tell why, but she&rsquo;s holding something back, and her hand keeps slipping to the belt at her waist. She&rsquo;s on edge, her eyes almost pleading with you not to force her to act rashly.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This passage tells us a lot more than a clinical description of what&rsquo;s happening: it breaths context and emotion into the Scene, and Hans&rsquo;s Player will feel it more. It&rsquo;s more visceral.</p>\n<h3>Embody Uncaring Gods</h3>\n<p>Look through the eyes of uncaring Gods! Nothing is sacred in the Old World, when you look at it from on high. Nothing is beyond being killed, burned, maimed, or crushed. Consider always how things could get worse, and put those threats against all of your creations. No NPC is safe, no boon given to a Character is permanent.</p>\n<p>Further, consider the malevolence of the Ruinous Powers. Always look for the failings in every Character that crosses your path. How can you tempt them? How can you corrupt them? How can you raise them up, only to bring them low again? Pull no punches.</p>\n<h3>Evil is Rampant, Good is Rare</h3>\n<p>Reward evil, punish the good. Crime pays. Chaos runs rampant not through the lack of heroes, but the abundance of villains. The easy way out is almost always unclean. The right thing to do comes without reward, without celebration, and often with a knife in one&rsquo;s back. Look always to offer easier solutions through compromised means, and stress that the world is unkind to optimists.</p>\n<h3>Focus on the Characters</h3>\n<p>Despite the Old World being an awful place to be, and our Characters are frequently far from heroes, in the end the story is about them. They may not always be the focal point of the stories unfolding around them, but they are our focus for how the story is told. They are our protagonists. You should be always hoping for the best for your Players&rsquo; Characters, whilst setting threats in their path. Every Combat should be one you hope they survive. Every moment your Players are on the edges of their seats, so you should be!</p>\n<p>But, like any good story, we can only hope if there is something threatening that hope. You are not focusing on your Characters if you fail to create appropriate challenges for them to tackle. By that same token, you do not focus on your Characters if you never let them celebrate, nor celebrate with them. You are not there to be their enemy, but to present enemies for them to &mdash; hopefully &mdash; overcome.</p>\n<h3>Everyone Has a History</h3>\n<p>Name everyone &mdash; give them a home and a heart. The Old World is made of regular people, not caricatures. Everyone has a name, a history, a home, and a heart. Though evil does truly exist in the Old World, it is almost always a tool to follow one&rsquo;s ambitions and dreams. No one commits evil for no reason, not even the monsters of the deepest darkest places.</p>\n<p>You should strive to give a reason for things, and for the actions of the NPCs. These need not be complex, covering multiple pages of notes, but they should exist. A good rule is to give every NPC a Motivation and at least one Ambition.</p>\n<h3>Lead the Playres to Their Story</h3>\n<p>Ask leading questions, and build on the answers. Don&rsquo;t just ask, &lsquo;<em>Johann, you&rsquo;re a soldier, do you have any scars?&rsquo; </em>but rather<em> &lsquo;Johann, who gave you your worst scar, and how does that memory haunt you to this day?</em>&rsquo;&nbsp; The latter invites creativity far more than the former. It gives agency to a Player to describe their Character in depth. Further, the answers should be used by you at a later point to give weight to a Scene. Perhaps Johann got his scar from a Beastman&rsquo;s axe? Later, maybe Johann finds a body in the forest, with wounds made by an axe that shares an uncomfortable similarity to his own scar&hellip;</p>\n<p>These questions can also be used to disclaim decision making, granting the authority to the Players. If they ask, &lsquo;<em>Is there a chandelier in this room that I can swing off of?</em>&rsquo; you could answer &lsquo;<em>Yes</em>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<em>No</em>,&rsquo; or better yet, &lsquo;<em>There wouldn&rsquo;t normally be, but why don&rsquo;t you tell me why there is?</em>&rsquo; These sorts of leading, disclaimed questions allow the Players to share in the world, and make it feel like their own.</p>\n<h3>Be a Friend, and an Enemy</h3>\n<p>Give with one hand, and take with the other. Warhammer isn&rsquo;t about getting what you want. Or rather, it&rsquo;s about getting what you want at horrendous cost. With every inch of ground the Characters claim, new problems, threats, and scars are sure to arise. They should pay for every victory in blood &mdash; often that of their enemies, but their own is very much on the line. Even simple things, like moving one rung up the social ladder, means someone else is displaced, and another enemy joins the fight against the Characters.</p>\n<h3>Always Advance the Story</h3>\n<p>Move off-screen, in the shadows. Whilst the story is about the Characters, it doesn&rsquo;t revolve around them. Keep the action flowing in the background. Have your NPCs act without regard for the Characters; living their own lives, pursuing their own Ambitions. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ambush the Characters, or to have opportunities pass them by. The Old World isn&rsquo;t waiting for them to solve its problems, but is driving full steam ahead toward the drop-off. If the Characters don&rsquo;t get in the road, or try to change tracks, it&rsquo;s gone &mdash; as it should be.</p>\n<p>This might mean that the Characters lose sometimes, or that they don&rsquo;t have time to solve every problem. That&rsquo;s perfect. In the real world, no one person has time to do everything, and can only act on their priorities. In the Old World, we can call our priorities our Ambitions &mdash; everything else has to fend for itself.</p>\n<h3>Embrace Conflict</h3>\n<p>Trust your Characters to create their own conflict. You rarely have to challenge the Characters directly to create conflict &mdash; trust in the Motivations and Ambitions of the Characters. Create situations that threaten those Ambitions, and promise Motivations, and your Players will get themselves into conflict. The best Adventures are ones the Characters choose to undertake themselves, so your job is to let them do that.</p>\n<h3>Be Truthful (To Players)</h3>\n<p>Speak truth to Players, speak lies to Characters. Never lie to your Players. Ever. But never tell your Characters the whole truth. This means being frank with your Players: tell them, right at the start, that not everything they&rsquo;re told will be true. But when your Players ask a question &mdash; when they use their Skills to interrogate a scene &mdash; be truthful with the information they gain. If they succeed on their Perception Test, tell them truthfully what they find. If they fail on their Intuition Test,&nbsp;tell them what they truthfully believe.&nbsp;Make sure your Players know&nbsp;the difference between&nbsp;their knowledge, and&nbsp;the knowledge of their&nbsp;Characters. Make&nbsp;them understand the&nbsp;difference between&nbsp;those truths.</p>","_id":"0hJn73SxER55dvmA"}

Most people in between are acutely aware of their standing, and preoccupied with improving it. This is represented by Status, which can modify the interactions between people of different social classes.</p>\n<h3>Tiers and Standing</h3>\n<p>Status is expressed as a Tier &mdash; from lowest to highest: Brass, Silver, or Gold &mdash; and a Standing &mdash; which is a number, generally from 1&ndash;5, showing how respected the character is within their Tier.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have a higher Tier than another character, you have higher Status. If you are in the same Tier as another character, then you are higher Status if you have a higher Standing.</p>\n<h4>The Three Tiers</h4>\n<p>The most important distinctions in Status are the three Tiers:</p>\n<p><strong>The Gold Tier</strong>: Reserved for the rulers of society; those who directly serve them as advisors, protectors, and maintainers of the law; and the independently wealthy. To reach this position requires hard work, success, and not a little luck. All in the Gold tier are rich, respected, and of higher Status than those in the Silver and Brass tiers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Silver Tier</strong>: Populated by well-to-do townsfolk and those following professions requiring skill and expertise. Tradesmen, craftsmen, and merchants make up most of the upper ranks of the&nbsp;tier, whilst the bottom is filled by those providing services. These folk lead relatively humble lives, but they are still respectable. People of the Silver Tier are of higher Status than those of the Brass Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>The Brass Tier</strong>: Occupied by peasants and those in the poorest professions which often require no particular skills. The Brass Tier also contains many criminals, ne&rsquo;er-do-wells, and those who don&rsquo;t make any living at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Determining Status</h3>\n<p>Your Status is determined by your Career level. Beside the name of your Career level is your Status, marked as &lsquo;Brass 3&rsquo;, &lsquo;Silver 1&rsquo;, or similar. This is the Tier and Standing. Should you change Career, check the new Status by the name of your new Career Level, and mark it on your Character Sheet.</p>\n<h3>Changing Status</h3>\n<p>Status changes for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You change Career.</li>\n<li>You gain a Talent that modifies Status.</li>\n<li>The GM imposes a change in Status due to in-game events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever causes a change in Status, you should take time to explain what exactly occurred, and the impact this has on your character. If you have changed to a different Career Level, say from a Student to a Scholar, what precipitated this? What subject did you study? And how does your character now feel after graduating? Taking time to explain your changing circumstances makes your character more rounded and believable.</p>\n<h3>The Effects of Status</h3>\n<p>Status influences a number of situations that impact your Character. Often these involve making Tests easier or more difficult. The GM may expand or limit these influences as they wish.</p>\n<h4>Charm</h4>\n<p>Status impacts Charm significantly, with those of higher Status more easily able to get what they want, and those of lower status finding it harder to secure influence. In most circumstances, those of a higher Tier gain a bonus of +10 to Charm Tests influencing those with a lower tier. Similarly, those of lower Tier suffer a penalty of &ndash;10 to influence those of a higher Tier. The GM may also apply these modifiers to those of different Standing in the same Tier, but this is rarer.</p>\n<p>If the target of the Charm attempt is atypical, this might not work as usual however. An individual who &lsquo;Defies Status&rsquo; would mean no modifiers apply, and one with &lsquo;Extreme Views&rsquo; might mean that the opposite modifiers apply (&ndash;10 rather than +10, for example).</p>\n<h4>Entertain</h4>\n<p>Status does not normally influence Entertain tests. However, a GM ought to consider that some entertainments are thought fitting to particular venues. A peasant playing a hurdy-gurdy is not likely to go down well at an opera house, whilst even a mediocre orchestra is likely to draw a significant audience if it starts performing on the village green.</p>\n<p>As such the GM might like to consider the sort of audience a performance is normally aimed at, and the audience that is actually available, and apply suitable modifiers.</p>\n<h4>Intimidate</h4>\n<p>If you have a higher Status than the target of your Intimidate, you typically gain a bonus of +10.</p>\n<h4>Gossip</h4>\n<p>Gossip tends to be stilted between people of different classes. Any Gossip Test between individuals of different Tiers suffers a penalty of &ndash;10.</p>\n<h4>Leadership</h4>\n<p>Status plays a very important role in Leadership. Indeed, the State Army normally only grants higher ranks to those of noble birth.</p>\n<p>If you are a higher tier than the target of your Leadership Test, you gain a bonus of +10. If you are two tiers higher, the bonus increases to +20.</p>\n<h3>Maintaining Status</h3>\n<p>In order to benefit (or suffer) from Status, you have to act in accordance with your role in society.</p>\n<p>It may be that you wish to pass incognito, presenting yourself anonymously. Typically, you will be counted as having a Status of Brass 3 if you do this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Hans the noble wears the latest fashions and always buys the best trappings. He rides his lovingly groomed horse into a village, pausing only to let his herald announce his presence to all. He fully benefits from his Gold 2 Status. His brother Heinrich dresses in old clothes, hides all his courtly garb under the bed, and acts like a nameless wanderer. He is treated as having a Status of Brass 3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Keeping Up Appearances</h4>\n<p>Characters need to spend a certain amount of money to maintain their lifestyle. As explained in @JournalEntry[The Cost of Living] there are minimum expectations of expenditure for each Tier.</p>\n<p>Should a character fail to live up to these levels of expenditure they will begin to be perceived as being of lower Status, losing 1 point of Standing per week.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To stop this decline, the character must resume spending the money expected of them, whereupon they regain 1 point of Standing a week until they recover the lost points.</p>\n<p>Should Standing reach 0, your tier drops by one and your Standing is set to 5. If you are already at the lowest tier, then your Status sticks at Brass 0.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Pietr is a Noble and has been slumming it in the East End of Altdorf for the last two weeks, letting his Standing of Gold 3 drop to Gold 1 as he eats poor food, drinks cheap beer, and hostels in flop houses. Should another week pass and Pietr does not change his ways, his Standing will drop to Gold 0, which immediately becomes Silver 5. Should this occur, Pietr&rsquo;s father will almost certainly step in to curtail the family shame&hellip;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Earning Money with Status</h3>\n<p>Your Status is directly linked to the amount of money you earn while working. The higher your Status, the more money you can earn as your good name attracts business. If the GM agrees, during play you can spend a week to work in your Career assuming you are in a place where such is feasible (it&rsquo;s hard to be a Watchman in the middle of a wasteland). This is called Earning.</p>\n<p>When Earning, make an <strong>Average (+20) Dramatic</strong> Test against the Earning Skill of your Career (the Skill marked in italics in the Career&rsquo;s first level). If passed, you receive the money marked in the table below. If failed, you receive half the money. If an Astounding Failure (&ndash;6) is scored, you have a very bad week, and earn nothing (or have your money stolen, or some similar mishap).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This total is not strictly speaking how much money you earn, it&rsquo;s more a representation of how much money you have left at the end of the week after all your expenses are taken into account.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is the same amount of coin earned with an @JournalEntry[Income] Endeavour.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Gunther the Coachman decides he&rsquo;ll work for the Four Seasons Coaching House for a week while his peers research a library for things he frankly doesn&rsquo;t understand, and secretly thinks may be heretical if he did. The GM agrees to let Gunther enact some Earning, so Gunther rolls against his Drive (Coach) skill (his Earning Skill for Coachman) and passes. Given his Status is Silver 2, he can roll 2d10 and earn that much silver. Unfortunately, he only rolls a 1 and a 2 for a total of 3 silver shillings; clearly Gunther was drinking a lot after his long work shifts, and has little coin remaining&hellip;</em></p>"}

Known for his black moods and erratic temper, folk claim his cult is needed more than any other, for if ever there is a god that must be appeased, it’s Manaan. He’s depicted as an enormous, black-bearded man with seaweed in his hair and a great, five-pointed crown of black iron upon his troubled brow. He’s said to dwell at the bottom of the ocean, the rise and fall of his massive chest forming the waves and tides as the greatest monsters of the deep gather in his court.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Manann is worshipped along coasts throughout the Old World, wherever people make their living from the sea or live close enough for storms and floods to threaten their homes. Even those who know little of Manann will throw a coin or other small treasure into the water before beginning a sea voyage in the hope of a smooth crossing.</p>\n<p>The cult has a significant number of orders, mostly monastic, tasked to guard isolated, sacred islands. The Order of the Albatross is largest, comprised of priests who maintain temples across the Old World and bless merchant or naval vessels with their presence. Often accompanying them, the Order of the Mariner is the military arm of Manann, the cult’s templar-marines, sworn protectors of Marienburg.</p>\n<p>Manann’s clerics usually wear robes of dark greenish-blue or blue-grey, trimmed with a white wave-pattern.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Manann’s temples are found in all coastal towns and cities, and in most river ports where seagoing vessels berth. The high temple is in the great port-city of Marienburg: a huge, lavishly decorated complex open to the tides. The Matriarch of the Sea, head of the Order of the Albatross, is based there, a woman who ostensibly leads the entire cult of Manann, although in practice the sea-god’s clerics are as mercurial as&nbsp; their god, and as likely to be stubborn as to serve.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cult also maintains many monasteries and abbeys on small isolated islands, most dedicated to one of Manann’s many saints.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances from Manann often involve hazardous, maritime pilgrimages, tests of sailing skills, or expeditions against the sea-god’s enemies, especially followers of the heretical cult of Stromfels, God of Pirates, Wreckers, and Sharks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"font-style: normal;\"><strong>Strictures</strong></h3>\n<ul style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n<li>No whistling or swearing when at sea or on holy ground.</li>\n<li>Never harm an albatross.</li>\n<li>First catch to Manann.</li>\n<li>A silver and fish to every Manannite temple and shrine approached.</li>\n<li>Hunt down the servants of Stromfels wherever they may hide.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Blessing of Hardiness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.eBRjKAF6U0yR0KK8]{Blessing of Savagery}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Blessing of Tenacity}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Geo6EAR39JzaP9P2]{Becalm}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.i5DW3xX2lGu6Pps6]{Drowned Man's Face}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.nQ9Fydtqshroi11E]{Fair Winds}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.IKW03JiqXVdDoPA6]{Manann's Bounty}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.VUyCJ5LRPkuC5iZx]{Sea Legs}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iWVQRVDVDCx1SyPA]{Waterwalk}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/manann.webp"}

Accidents happen, and whenever an Altdorfer hears of a careless traveller falling from the bridge, they mutter that the Daemon has taken its due.</p>"}

But try playing without that 10%, and you&rsquo;ll lose every time.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&ndash; Hermann Graumann, Gambler, Raconteur and Liar</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">During the game, you&rsquo;ll find yourself in all sorts of situations where the outcome your Character&rsquo;s action is uncertain. Will you jump the ravine or plunge to your death? Will you charm the officious courtier, or will the guards be summoned to deal with you? How well you perform these actions is determined by your Skills and Talents. In general, Skills describe the capabilities of your Character, and Talents are special abilities or tricks you&rsquo;ve learned.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Skills</h2>\n<p>Where Characteristics represent the raw potential of your body and mind, Skills represent specific areas of training, knowledge, experience. Each Advance you take in a Skill improves the odds of succeeding with appropriate tasks &mdash; Characters who are well trained or experienced may be able to best opponents who are more naturally gifted.</p>\n<h3>Determining your Skill Level</h3>\n<p>All Skills are associated with a single Characteristic, noted in the Skill&rsquo;s description. A Skill&rsquo;s rating is determined by taking its associated Characteristic and adding the number of Advances taken in the Skill. Space for recording your Advances for each Skill is provided on your Character Sheet.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Sigrid has a Fellowship of 41 and has taken 5 Advances in Charm, so her Charm is 46 (41+5=46).</em></p>\n<h3>Basic and Advanced Skills</h3>\n<p>Skills are classified as either <em>Basic </em>or <em>Advanced </em>.</p>\n<p>Basic Skills represent innate or common abilities that you might practice in day-to-day life. Basic Skills can be Tested even if you have taken no Advances in them. To do this, simply attempt a Test using the Characteristic associated with the Skill as described in Chapter 5: Rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Sigrid has no Advances in Athletics. However, as Athletics is a Basic Skill, she can still Test Athletics using the Characteristic associated with it: Agility.</em></p>\n<p>Advanced Skills require specialist knowledge, training, or first-hand experience to even attempt to use. You may only Test an Advanced Skill if you have taken at least one Advance in it. If you have not, you cannot attempt to Test the Skill. So, no matter how intelligent you are, you will not understand the finer points of law without the Lore (Law) Skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Adhemar has an Intelligence of 36 and no Advances in either the Basic Gamble Skill or the Advanced Heal Skill, both based on Intelligence. He can Test the Gamble Skill at 36% as it is Basic, and anyone can Test Basic Skills. The Heal Skill is an Advanced Skill, so Adhemar has no idea how to patch up wounds beyond screaming loudly for a doctor!</em></p>\n<h3>Grouped Skills and Specialisation</h3>\n<p>Some Skills are classified as Grouped . This means the Skill is an array of related Skills under one heading. Each related Skill is called a Specialisation . When a Specialisation is mentioned in the rules, it is marked in brackets.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Language is a Grouped Skill, thus represents many related Language Skills under a single Skill heading. Examples of the different Specialisations of Language are: Language (Bretonnian), Language (Magick), or Language (Mootish).</em></p>\n<p>When you gain an Advance in a Grouped Skill, you must allocate the Advance to an appropriate Specialisation. Sometimes the Specialisation options will be marked clearly in your Career, so you simply select one of the options on offer. In other cases &mdash; such as when a Specialisation is marked as &lsquo;Any&rsquo;, meaning you can choose one Specialisation &mdash; you will need to select a Specialisation yourself; should this be required, either refer to the relevant Skill description and choose from the sample Specialisations found there, or, with GM permission, create a unique Specialisation that fits the Skill and best suits your character.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Theodora has a choice of Lore (Any) in her career. When she allocates an Advance to that option, she has to decide which Lore Specialisation to take. After some deliberation, she chooses to advance her Lore (Theology), showing she has learned something of the Gods.</em></p>\n<p>Other than that, Grouped Skills are handled in exactly the same way as normal Skills, with each Specialisation handled like a unique Skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Sigrid has 8 Advances in the Basic Skill, Entertain (Singing), but nothing in Entertain (Acting). This means she Tests her Fellowship of 41 when attempting to act, and Tests 49 when singing (41+8=49). By comparison, Theodora has a single Advance in the Advanced Skill Animal Training (Pigeons), but no Advances in Animal Training (Horses). This means she can use the Skill to train her pigeons to drop bombs on unsuspecting enemies, but she cannot train her horse to do the same, as she has no idea how to train horses.</em></p>"}

Halflings are also a common sight in many of Reikland&rsquo;s villages, where it is not uncommon to find them employed to staff an inn or run a farm. They are communal creatures, preferring to live in close-knit family groups, sharing houses, rooms,and even beds with dozens of friends and relatives; everyone contributes and everyone shares. This interdependent lifestyle leaves many Halflings struggling with the concept of private ownership and space.</p>\n<p>Halflings are notoriously interested in recording their lineage, and many Halfling clans can trace their ancestry back many centuries to the very founding of the Mootland (their self-governed Grand Province in the Empire). The Elder of the Moot &mdash; currently Hisme Stoutheart &mdash; is the custodian of the <em>Haffenlyver</em> , an ancient embroidered scroll detailing the chief bloodlines of their primary clans, said to be the greatest treasure of the Halflings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another peculiar detail is the Halflings&rsquo; strange affinity for Ogres. Despite their ravenous appetites, and penchant for eating whatever is at hand, Ogres tend to respect Halflings. Indeed, gangs of Ogre labourers are often overseen by Halfling gaffers, and most Ogre mercenary bands have a Halfling cook on staff.</p>\n<p>Halflings are short, apple-cheeked and beardless, resembling big-eyed, round-faced (and round bodied) Human children, and their sunny dispositions and curly locks only reinforce this impression. They are known for their enormous appetites in all things and their lack of concern for personal space (they&rsquo;re huggers), social boundaries (&lsquo;Well me&rsquo; great aunt&rsquo;s just shacked up with me best mate, and you should hear what they&rsquo;ve been up to!&rsquo;), and property rights (&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s using it!&rsquo;); this last has landed more than one Halfling in jail for thievery.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opinions</h3>\n<h4>On Reiklander Humans&hellip;</h4>\n<p><em>&lsquo;Stiff-necked and pious, warlike and jealous&hellip; I could go on, but good manners halts me, and, besides, I like them, and they like me pies.

Unforgettable NPCs help create the impetus to roleplay and cause Players to become invested in what happens to them, and by extension, their own Characters. Not every NPC needs to be a tour de force of personality, but a few &lsquo;shining stars&rsquo; go a long way towards filling the firmament with light &ndash; or darkness, as the case may be.</p>\n<p>Every NPC you introduce into an adventure should be there for a purpose, which can vary wildly from &lsquo;background scenery&rsquo; to &lsquo;biggest bad-guy&rsquo; and everything in-between. Some you may place specifically because they can assist the characters or spur them onward by offering something valuable, e.g. knowledge, training, equipment &ndash; in exchange for something the Characters can offer them, e.g. investigative skill, money, directed violence. Others serve as potential antagonists or definite enemies, and consider having a few just because they&rsquo;re fun for you to play and your Players to enjoy.</p>\n<p>The following are the building blocks of an unforgettable NPC. You don&rsquo;t have to put as much detail into an NPC destined to be a &lsquo;prop&rsquo;, but that said, remain flexible. With practice, you may find that you create even minor NPCs memorable enough that your Players will occasionally promptly latch onto one, and even though you originally intended them to be nothing more than a bit of background flavour, they&rsquo;ll soon be dragged into the Characters&rsquo; adventures. Fortunately, <strong>WFRP </strong>has a designator for such folks &ndash; they make <em>excellent </em>Henchmen.</p>\n<p><strong>A Name</strong> &ndash; A decent name will do, but a really good name will stick in the mind. It will likely help you to create a small list of names in advance, checking them off as they get used. That way, if you have to come up with a name &lsquo;on the fly&rsquo; when the Characters insist on learning all about the innocuous barkeep, you won&rsquo;t have to fumble for one. Keep in mind that other points from later in this list may well be referred to in an NPC&rsquo;s name, especially if they are rare. There are a lot of forgettable &lsquo;Karls&rsquo; in the Empire, but &lsquo;Crimson Karl&rsquo; the gent that&rsquo;s eternally bright beet-red in the face from yelling? He&rsquo;ll stick out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong>Use the `/name` command to generate a name! <br />e.g. `/name human male` `/name welf male` `/name helf female`</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Appearance </strong>&ndash; What does the NPC look like? Some folks think they need to put a lot of detail into this, but really, too many details and your Players will just lose track, especially if you have a lot of NPCs. Always note species, but then, try to stick to, at the very most, two or three solid details that stand out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Height, weight, eye colour, and so forth, only need to be noted if they are unusual. Scars, odd tattoos, eccentric clothing choices, weird trappings, the fact they always carry a bedraggled cat with a tiny peg leg &ndash; these are the things people notice and Players remember.</p>\n<p><strong>Mannerisms </strong>&ndash; This is a big category, for it covers style of speech, personality traits, unusual quirks of behaviour, and how the NPC regularly deals with other folk. When determining how an NPC regularly acts, be wary of regularly using stereotypes &ndash; not every Dwarf is grumpy and short-tempered, but that said, there is a reason for that stereotype. A general note for an NPCs outward behaviour will often suffice. Are they friendly, taciturn, impatient, hostile?</p>\n<p>Think about what the NPC&rsquo;s voice sounds like. Especially if their voice sounds nothing like yours, it is okay to tell your Players what the NPCs voice may remind them of. If you want to do a different accent for a specific NPC and feel comfortable doing so, awesome, but be wary of giving strange voices to many NPCs, especially if they hurt your throat to do them. Instead, try playing with your vocabulary, speak in short sentences, using small words for a slow-witted Ogre; speak swiftly, on the edge of breathlessness, for a flighty Halfling.</p>\n<p>A quick search of the internet will yield more lists of example personality traits and quirks of behaviour than you can sic a small but vicious dog on. There are, in fact, whole websites dedicated to such and they can serve as inspiration, but be sure to consider how your Players, and their Characters, will react to certain traits &ndash; they are unlikely to want to deal a lot with someone really annoying (which, honestly, might be fun for you if they have to, for a time).</p>\n<p><strong>Career</strong> &ndash; What the NPC ostensibly does for a living. Most folk in the Old World are completely tied to their Class and Career and can generally afford to do very little outside of them, unless they are of a higher status with enough wealth to let them &lsquo;indulge&rsquo; in different pastimes. Many NPCs may well have had a different Career at one point, but only a few rare ones will have ever jumped between different Classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Unusual Qualities</strong> &ndash; This is a catch-all for traits others wouldn&rsquo;t suspect in the NPC. Particularly high levels of skill, Talents from outside their Career, strange knowledge, Traits from the Bestiary, and so on. Most NPCs should only have one or two Unusual Qualities at most, if any. Note that &lsquo;mutations&rsquo; generally fall under &lsquo;Problems&rsquo;.</p>\n<p><strong>Drives </strong>- Whole plots are driven by these most basic questions: What does the NPC want? What are they prepared to do to get it? Like Characters, important NPCs should have ambitions, though not every ambition has to be realistic. A low-born NPC may aspire to be a Baron one day. This is naught but a weirdroot dream for most folk, but society is changing in the Empire, and a driven merchant, or perhaps a crime lord, with the right connections might just achieve such a lofty goal. Your Characters will certainly have wanted to help such an individual along their way, or perhaps, did everything they could to stop them&hellip;</p>\n<p><strong>Problems </strong>&ndash; Finally, any NPC you know will interact with the Characters should have a problem or two that the Characters might be able to help them with, or take advantage of, which may, or may not, tie into their ambitions. Try to think of problems with multiple potential solutions, e.g. an NPC that has something the Characters desperately want, desires to advance in their Trade Guild, but feels trapped and doesn&rsquo;t know how to. Depending on the Characters&rsquo; skill sets, they could spread gossip about the superior nature of the NPC&rsquo;s wares, sabotage or kill their competition, bribe their superiors, etc. Some problems should actually be &lsquo;secrets&rsquo; which may, or may not, have an actual solution, e.g. hidden mutations, holding to a forbidden faith, an unrequited love, etc. Most such problems can&rsquo;t be &lsquo;solved&rsquo;, but they&rsquo;re ripe for blackmail.</p>\n<h2>Sample NPCs</h2>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.ePPk15Vxu9RxPtYV]{Dieter K&auml;segeier, Cheesemonger Extraordinaire}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Rs3lMA5UavTlTiJW]{Kastor Erichson, Jumpy Hunter}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.nRJxtciIhTHKqAvY]{Stellemar, Loyal Hound}</strong></p>","_id":"3gMb9oLfh3ng7KOE"}

If the Characters enter at night, Melone is not present, and is instead off somewhere feeding, to return come sunrise.</p>\n<h3>&lsquo;WHO&rsquo;S WITH ME?&rsquo;</h3>\n<p>The Characters may be uncomfortable about confronting a Vampire by themselves and may ask other tenants to help them deal with the problem. However, each has an excuse &mdash; whether valid or not &mdash; as to why they can&rsquo;t:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfortunately, Gino is far too large to fit down the stairs and would be less than useless in the cramped basement.</li>\n<li>Annika Passerine refuses to leave her children alone, especially if the Characters are foolish enough to tell her there is a Vampire on the loose.</li>\n<li>Sreluc White-Eyes likewise refuses to leave his brother. Srulem, on the other hand, is determined to come with the Characters but can&rsquo;t even stand without at least two Characters helping him.</li>\n<li>Eluharath Wavecrest won&rsquo;t even bother to respond to their pleas for help &mdash; he&rsquo;s going to protect himself, and that&rsquo;s it.</li>\n<li>The other tenants all nervously mill around the top of the stairs if they are told what is happening and that the Characters are going into the basement. None of them are brave enough to go looking for a Vampire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Basement</h3>\n<p>The basement of the tenement building is a foul place where folks stopped going decades ago due to the quagmire below leaking through the floorboards. Now, heaps of old laundry, festering ancient mattresses, crate upon crate of spoiled goods, loose rusty nails, and all manner of awfulness creates an absolute maze for the unwary. To add to these perils, an insane Vampire stalks between the stacks, fascinated and terrified by all the changes inflicted upon her.</p>\n<p>To determine where the Vampire is in the maze, the Characters will be required to perform a <strong>Very Hard (&minus;30) Track</strong> Test. Failure means the Characters continue to stumble through the maze and must roll 1d100 on the Maze Encounters Table, adding +10 to the result per &minus; SL. On a success, move to The Vampire&rsquo;s Lair. After every failed Test, the Test must be repeated, but at a cumulative +10. If the group is working together, they perform only a single Test, gaining additional Tests only if they split up (and therefore, suffering more consequences).</p>\n<h3>PROBLEMS ALONG THE PATH</h3>\n<p>If there is ever a question over which Character suffers the effects of an encounter, either determine the target randomly or use the Character with the lowest score in the associated Skill or Characteristic. Example: Loose Nail would target the Character with the lowest Perception Skill.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if Melone is present, she can perform an<strong> Easy (+40) Perception</strong> Test each Round the Characters spend in the maze. If the Characters are specifically choosing to be stealthy, the Character with the lowest <strong>Stealth</strong> Skill in the group may make this an Opposed Test. If Melone succeeds on her <strong>Perception </strong>Test, she will wait until the party is in an ill-opportune position and will ambush them. However, it takes her as many Rounds as the &minus;SL of the last Track Test (as the Characters are far away from her, and she must reach them herself through the maze, or along the ceiling).</p>\n<h3>The Vampire's Lair</h3>\n<p>Maria Melone&rsquo;s lair is hidden against one wall in the twisting labyrinth that is the basement of the Spittlefeld Tenement Building. She has a small, broken, polished mirror (into which she can often be seen staring, wondering where her reflection has gone), and a large stash of candles (though no way to light them, nor need to use them in the dark). She sleeps on a pile of soiled and bloody bed sheets, stolen from some of her victims. In one corner are broken and grime-coated cooking utensils, set up in a mockery of a fine noble kitchen.</p>\n<p>If the Characters manage to sneak up on Maria whilst she is in her lair, she is either staring at the mirror or pretending to cook something whilst humming to herself.</p>\n<p>She acts scared when confronted, but immediately turns feral &mdash; like a rabid wolf &mdash; when threatened. If the Characters treat her kindly, she will quickly be overcome with hunger and will attack them.</p>\n<p>Maria will fight to the death once her blood is up and has no sense of self-preservation. She has been driven entirely insane by her experiences and cannot speak in anything but clipped and babbled phrases. She appears to think she&rsquo;s being disciplined by her employer, whom she keeps calling &lsquo;Lord Bruner&rsquo;.</p>"}

Lost Wounds are considered to be small cuts, bruises, and other easily ignored injuries.</p>\n<h4>Healing Critical Wounds</h4>\n<p>If you have received any Critical Wounds, you are said to be Critically Wounded. Critical Wounds can be very serious. Refer to the appropriate Critical Table to see exactly what penalties you suffer for any Critical Wounds sustained. Critical Wounds do not count as healed until all conditions they inflict are removed, and all non-permanent negative modifiers are resolved. When you are Critically Wounded, you may still heal your Wounds using the normal rules.</p>\n<h3><strong>Medical Attention</strong></h3>\n<p>Several Critical Wound results and conditions cannot be resolved until you receive medical attention. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Successful use of the Heal skill.</li>\n<li>Application of a bandage, healing poultice, or similar.</li>\n<li>Successful use of a spell or prayer that heals Wounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Surgery</strong></h4>\n<p>Some wounds are beyond simple stitching and foul-smelling poultices. If you suffer a Critical Wound where surgery is required to attend to it (it will be marked: Surgery), you suffer the marked penalties until you visit an appropriately trained doctor or barber-surgeon, or somehow source a magical or divine surgery equivalent.</p>\n<p>Further, if you suffer an amputated body part, you cannot heal 1 of the suffered Wounds until a surgeon successfully treats it with a Heal Test.

She is the daughter of Verena and Morr, and the sister of Myrmidia. Shallya is normally portrayed as a young, beautiful maiden whose eyes are perpetually welling with tears as she weeps for the world’s pain. It is said Shallya’s compassion knows no bounds, and in some myths — such as the stories of Ranald tricking her into granting him immortality, or Manaan trapping her at the bottom of the sea — she seems trusting to the point of foolishness. However, her cultists maintain her mercy is available to all, without judgment. True foolishness consists of presuming to judge who is worthy of Shallya’s grace and who is not.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Most Old Worlders think of Shallya’s cult as composed of healers and physicians, but her worshippers also include many who work to help alleviate suffering of other kinds: charitable souls who help the poor; workers in orphanages, asylums, and refuges; and even brave folk who go in search of lost and missing people on behalf of their loved ones.&nbsp; The cult is ruled by the far-reaching Order of the Bleeding Heart, which maintains all the temples, hospices, mercyhouses, and other holy sites. The significantly smaller Order of the Chalice tasks its mendicants to cleanse the Fly Lord’s influence, tackling the worst diseases and plagues wherever they may fester.</p>\n<p>Shallya’s cultists all wear white robes, often hooded, with a bleeding heart symbol embroidered on the left breast.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>The high temple of all Shallya’s cult is in Couronne, Bretonnia, built over a famous healing spring. Locals claim the magical waters were once poured there from the same chalice Shallya used to grant Ranald immortality, which they claim is the holy grail of the Lady, the patron Goddess of Bretonnia. Whatever the truth, it is a popular destination for pilgrims, many of whom travel there to be healed from intractable disease. Elsewhere, every town or city of any size has a temple to Shallya, and most smaller settlements have at least a shrine dedicated to her. Temples of Shallya normally consist of a courtyard with a temple on one side and an infirmary on the other, all constructed in southern styles. Larger temples have smaller subsidiary chapels, commonly endowed by local families, and are often connected to hospitals. Shrines are usually simple, often with the dove or heart of Shallya carved into stone, or with small fountains gushing eternal tears from simple statues.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances set by Shallya always involve helping the sick, poor, or downtrodden. A cultist might be sent to a village struck by a plague to tend the sick until the disease has passed. Shallya often tasks her servants to help the wounded at war, or patrol popular pilgrimage routes for those unable to complete their journeys due to ill health.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Strictures</span></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Always render assistance without judgement, based only on a person’s need.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never kill except in self-defence or when facing followers of the Fly Lord.</em></li>\n<li><em>Hunt down servants of the Fly Lord wherever they may fester.</em></li>\n<li><em>Shallya’s work is never done, so turn not to self-indulgence.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never take up arms; a walking stick and courage will suffice.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.C92dpJPRYpkZFsGu]{Blessing of Healing}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Jkt465WPdRcejLwl]{Blessing of Recuperation}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Blessing of Tenacity}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.uMECZBuDnb3qkc7k]{Anchorite's Endurance}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.8LcAFB6W37LDN70K]{Balm to a Wounded Mind}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.UtgGJK46K08TZpP5]{Bitter Catharsis}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.YCjWyU567vb4Rs11]{Martyr}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.YAauxOwJJa3JahxQ]{Shallya's Tears}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.SItGUVYokyOo7csk]{Unblemished Innocence}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/shallya.webp"}

Currently in the safe-room is a sack of stolen coinage &mdash; 10d10 brass pennies, and 5d10 silver shillings &mdash; as well as 12 and a half pairs of stolen boots, 2 crates of stolen grog, and a box full of stolen medicines and poultices from an apothecary.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day the Characters may recall hearing Srulem yelling at the door to the penthouse.

While this is not one of the most populist movements in Altdorf, one of the main planks of her argument is telling bawdy tales that expose the hypocrisy of Magisters on this matter, which always gathers a fair crowd.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;It is so unfair I tell you! If Magister G&uuml;nter Hunold can attend the parties of Michaela von J&auml;nke and engage in unrestrained debauchery, then why cannot my Magnus spend a night with me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Luther Huss is in Altdorf and is to preach upon the subject of Valten&rsquo;s Heroism at the Mallusschmied Palais tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Johan Kyttlie &ndash; Weather Scryer</h3>\n<p>Johan makes his living selling weather forecasts to ship&rsquo;s captains and anyone else who wants one. To do this he employs many traditional Reikland techniques, almost all of which require string, dried fish and a limited ability to call on the Winds of Magic. If questioned, he will stress at length that he is not in fact a Hedge Wizard, and that all of his divination methods are done with science, not magic at all. In common with other Altdorf Weather Scryers, Johan wears tattered robes covered with divination trinkets and carries a copper shod staff with seabird feathers pinned to it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Something is not right, the weather has been wrong for the last two weeks and that incident with the burning barge just made it worse. There is a storm coming, mark my words!&rdquo;*</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A new guild of thieves from Stirland known as the Pale-Eye Gang has started up an operation on the docks, stealing whole cargos. It can only be a matter of time before they start an all out gang war with the Hooks or the Fish.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Last week, Joseph the pavement artist chalked up a drawing of Klaus von Tsch&uuml;tscher involved with a goblin. It was just outside von Tsch&uuml;tscher&rsquo;s townhouse; about an hour before the ambassador from Karak Norn was due to arrive. Well they found Joseph three days later, holed up in the temple of Shallya with all his fingers missing.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Wolfgang Meinerzhagen &ndash; Verenan Student</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A student at the Ulli von Tasseninck School of Religious Studies, Wolfgang is undertaking extensive theological and legal studies to become a Litigant in service to the cult of Verena. He owns a small flat in the Schlafstadt district, from which he undertakes many a nightly foray into the Three Toll Bridge in search of wine, weirdroot and political opinion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Michaela von J&auml;nke is somewhat of an expert on legal liberties. She is also said to hold some of the most exquisite parties in Altdorf.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A few weeks back the watch took hold of Andreas Gesetz the Cartographer, saying his maps were so contradictory he must have been taking Notropian Blue. It turns out though he was using a licensed supplier, so the case got dismissed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The problem is this city just does not value the written word! You can burn the works of Leonardo and suffer no more than a penny fine for destroying the parchment!&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Joey Proudhun &ndash; Halfling Agitator</h3>\n<p>A little man with big ideas, Joey came to the capitol of the Empire demanding reform of the outdated political system in favour of a thinking man&rsquo;s representative council based on the shire system of the moot. As a Halfling, Joey has been refused membership of every radical group he has sought to join, which he puts down to just another example of the outmoded &lsquo;bigist&rsquo; ideas of the supposedly civilised humans. Each day Joey preaches from a barrel top about political reform, handing out leaflets and quoting passages from &lsquo;the Blood of Innocents&rsquo; when the watch are not looking.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The Van Damneg Print-works does good rates per sheet, which is why they get so much custom. Everything from honest essays upon the plight of the working man to textbooks for surgeons and priests.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Michaela von J&auml;nke is just another example of the corrupt nature of the cities political elite &ndash; she is no friend of the common man regardless of his stature that is for sure!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The so-called rumours of Rat-men are no more than the Emperor&rsquo;s Lies to confuse the common man &ndash; The legions of Fishmen are the true hidden enemy of the Empire!&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>"}

Those who perform such feats are known by many names in different parts of the Old World — including: Living Saints, Gods’ Servants, The Hallowed, Divine Wills, Anointed Ones — but, in the Empire, they are most commonly referred to as ‘Blessed’, which is often used as a title. So, if Sister Anna where to be Blessed by Sigmar — i.e. granted Sigmar’s grace, able to have her prayers answered — she would become ‘Blessed Anna’, or, in full, ‘Blessed Anna, Sister of Sigmar’.</p>\n<h3>The Blessed</h3>\n<p>There are two Talents that specifically mark out those Blessed by the gods: @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.QyjWtSdnVMT04l5Y]{Bless} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.voV0C2ar1bKpcpnH]{Invoke}. Characters with the Bless Talent may enact Blessings, which are minor manifestations of divine will, while the Invoke Talent allows the Blessed to call on their gods for more powerful Miracles.</p>\n<h4>Blessings and Miracles</h4>\n<p>Blessing and Miracles are prayers spoken by one of the Blessed, and then empowered by a god. To enact a Blessing or Miracle, make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Pray </strong>Test. If you score a Success, your Blessing or Miracle manifests according to its rules, and a high SL will give you bonus effects. If you score a Failure, your words are spoken, but your god, for whatever reason, refuses to listen. If you Fumble the Pray Test, you have offended your god and must roll on the Wrath of the Gods table.</p>\n<h4>Limitations</h4>\n<p>You must be able to speak to intone the required prayer, rite, chant, or song to enact a Blessing or Miracle. Each of your Blessings or Miracles can only be in effect once, meaning you have to wait for an existing one to come to an end before using the same prayer again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Multiple invocations of the same prayer by different individuals do not offer cumulative bonuses. Thus, intoning two Blessings of Finesse will only provide a bonus of +10 to Dexterity.</p>\n<h3>Sin Points</h3>\n<p>The Blessed are watched closely by the gods, and risk gaining the disfavour of their deities if they should act contrary to their gods’ will. In game, this is represented with Sin points.</p>\n<p>If you violate any of the Cult Strictures listed under your god, the GM will award one or more Sin Points. Every time you receive a Sin point, it is added it to your running total. There is no maximum to the number of Sin points you can earn. The more points you have, the more upset your god is likely to be should you call upon divine aid.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>It's a Sin!</em></h3>\n<p><em>There are many different ways Blessed Priests can break their strictures; GMs should consider the scale of the infraction when awarding Sin Points, and allocate them proportionately, normally scoring 1 to 3. For instance, one of the strictures of the cult of Myrmidia is to respect prisoners of war. If a Myrmidian priest were to deny a thirsty prisoner of war a drink of water, this may earn a single Sin point. Beating a prisoner would be a great infraction, securing maybe 2 Sin points. Torturing or killing a helpless prisoner is unacceptable to Myrmidia, easily earning 3 or maybe more Sin points.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Kind GMs may wish to warn players before they commit infractions, especially if they are new to WFRP.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Sin and Wrath</h4>\n<p>Appealing to your deity when you have been acting contrary to the god’s wishes is risky. Whenever you make a Pray Test, if the units die of the result is equal to or less than your current Sin point total, then you will suffer the Wrath of the Gods, even if the Pray Test is successful.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Preach It, Sister!</em></h3>\n<p><em>Each of the gods have different styles of prayers, designed to be intoned in different ways. Whether these are the warcries of Ulric, the shanties of Manaan, or the threnodies of Morr, each requires the words be spoken (or sung) firmly, and with conviction.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>To represent this, the GM may require that any Pray Tests that are intoned quietly or without confidence have a higher Difficulty.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><em>You've Got To Pray!</em></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">If a character behaves in a particularly pious manner, such as completing an arduous pilgrimage, or making a significant donation to their cult, the GM may wish to remove one or more Sin Points with a successful Pray Test, used to show you are begging for absolution. This, of course, also risks the chance of Wrath of the Gods. Otherwise, the only way to remove Sin Points is by rolling on the Wrath of the Gods table.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Wrath Of The Gods</h3>\n<p>The Wrath of Gods table is referenced whenever you Fumble a Pray Test, or when the units die of a Pray Test is equal or lower than your current Sin points. The GM may also use it, or pluck results from it, whenever you foolishly insult any of the gods. When rolling on the @Table[wrath], add +10 to the roll for each Sin Point you have accrued. After rolling and applying the result, reduce your Sin points by 1, to a minimum of 0.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong>You can add a modifier to a table by right clicking the table link</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Penance</h4>\n<p>Some Wrath of the Gods results require penance. The GM can decide upon a suitable penance depending on your misdeed, or they may prefer you to choose your own penance, with further punishment awaiting if you are insufficiently penitent. Examples of typical penances are listed in each cult description. Penances may come in the form of a vision, divine inspiration or, very rarely, by direct communication from your deity. If you are not worthy of such contact, a penance may be conveyed through another member of your cult. Alternatively, a Divine Servant of the cult could manifest — this could be a dead teacher, a figure of legend, or an appropriate animal — and inform you what is required. The GM should consider the sins involved, and how the god in question would likely react to these.</p>"}

It shouldn&rsquo;t take the Characters long to decide to either speak to Passerine and attempt to get the diary from her, or to give chase to the child.</p>\n<p>Annika Passerine&rsquo;s Orphanage</p>\n<p>Annika Passerine runs an orphanage that spans half of the second and 3rd floors of Spittlefeld &mdash; the intervening ceiling between the floors having fallen in some time ago.</p>\n<p>The walls and floors inside the orphanage are peeling and heavily damaged but are otherwise clean, as Passerine works hard to keep her children in good standing.</p>\n<p>The orphanage has a kitchen where Passerine and some of the older children cook, a nursery where a half-dozen toddlers and babies sleep, and a dormitory where the older kids live. Passerine herself lives in a corner of the nursery and sleeps on a small cot.</p>\n<p>Annika Passerine will not take kindly to anyone asking questions about her kids. If the Characters pass a Challenging (+0) Charm Test and swear not to harm the children in any way, she will admit that one child, Trinity, has a bad habit of stealing things. She&rsquo;ll state the child is yet to understand why it&rsquo;s bad to steal, but will ultimately refuse to help them get the diary from him, unless they help her first.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Orphan Trinity</p>\n<p>No one knows where Trinity came from or what his name was before Passerine found him. Running out of names, his adoptive mother took inspiration from the three dots tattooed onto his back in a triangle. Now, two years later, Trinity can either be found clutching at Passerine&rsquo;s leg as she does her daily rounds, or crawling through the walls and under the beds of the guests and tenants of Spittlefeld.</p>\n<p>Trinity is still too young to understand ownership, and Passerine does her best to discourage his sticky fingers, which have a habit of picking up the most curious of collectables.</p>\n<p>Trinity is two and a half years old and tiny, with ruddy skin and a beaming smile. He doesn&rsquo;t talk much, but once he gets running, there are few who can catch him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Passerine has several sick children under her care at the moment and needs medicine to help them. Luckily, none of the children have fallen ill with the plague sweeping through the building, and they are expected to make a recovery if they can get the medicine they need. However, with the quarantine, no medicine can come in, and</p>\n<p>Doktor Giliani already used all of her supplies. Sreluc and Srulem, Dwarf brothers who live on the 4th floor, are the only people left in the building who have medicine.</p>\n<p>If the Characters can get some of that medicine for her, Passerine will convince Trinity to return the diary.</p>\n<h3>The Chase</h3>\n<p>Whether the Characters know who they are chasing or not, they may find themselves trying to catch Trinity when he runs away and hides in the crawl space between the walls. Unless there is a Halfling in the party who can squeeze in after him, this will be incredibly difficult.</p>\n<p>It will require the Characters to run ahead and take a gamble by blocking off exits.</p>\n<p>The chase should be run as a Pursuit (Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, page 166). For the purposes of the Pursuit, Trinity has the following Characteristics: Athletics 45, Movement 4. Trinity has a head start of 5 and will continue to move around until his lead exceeds 10, at which point he will leave the crawl space through one of the vents and hide somewhere. Unless the Characters are inside the crawl space, the Pursuit can never fall below 1 Distance.</p>\n<p>Trinity will only move between the ground floor and the first four floors, refusing to go to the penthouse on the 5th floor or to the basement. There is one entrance to the crawl space on each floor in the main stairwell for floors 1st through 5th, and another entrance in the flophouse and basement.</p>\n<p>A Character can use their turn to move up or down the stairs to block off an entrance, but it takes an entire Round just to get to the entrance. Alternately, they can jump over the railing on the stairs to travel farther. Refer to Falling on page 166 of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.</p>\n<p>Each landing is 4 yards above the one below.</p>\n<p>Blocking off an exit reduces Trinity&rsquo;s successive Tests by &minus;1 SL. If the Characters catch Trinity or manage to block off all the exits except the basement, Trinity will begin wailing for Annika and will try to come out. Through tears Trinity will scream that he is scared to go in the basement and will give up the diary. Hearing the child&rsquo;s cries, Annika rushes to help, demanding to know what&rsquo;s going on.

The conflicts created by these five themes can fuel almost any Adventure. And ultimately, these themes coalesce into the main looming peril of the setting: <em>The End Times</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Class Struggle — Rich vs Poor</li>\n<li>Ideology — Order vs Chaos</li>\n<li>Modernisation — Urban vs Rural</li>\n<li>Factionalism — Us vs Them</li>\n<li>Religion — Cult vs Cult</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Class Struggle</h3>\n<p>Class struggle underpins a lot of the Empire — rich vs poor. Given <strong>WFRP </strong>is focused on the everyday lives turned grim adventures of Imperial citizens, it is one that is seen everywhere. The poor under classes are constantly being pushed around by the rich upper class. The burgeoning middle class is driving a wedge between the two and making both, in many ways, redundant. Wealth, once clutched in the hands of the elite, is being hoarded by those who were born peasants, or whose parents worked the fields in serfdom. This struggle brings revolutionaries, agitators, criminals, and tyrants on to the centre stage, and helps feed into the conflicts presented in all four other major themes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Herr Dohrmann is a ‘merchant’ in the ‘very short-term loan’ business. Dohrmann is always looking for a ‘few steady hands’ to collect on his overdue accounts, occasionally with some violent interest. Characters working for Dohrmann soon find themselves collecting purses of silver from folk living in muddy hovels, while conversely stripping destitute nobles of their still-valuable, if faded, garments.<br><br></li>\n<li>Roswitha Sprenge is a malcontent demanding better treatment for the dockworkers of Kemperbad. While some of her points are valid, when the local merchant council actually tried to address her complaints, she immediately brought up new grievances and her rhetoric turned violent. The merchants want to know if she is an agitator with a grudge or a paid agent of nobles seeking to destabilize the freistadt.<br><br></li>\n<li>There is nothing to be done. The Baron Meinhard Tussen-Hochen is clearly within his rights to punish his peasants that fail to meet their grain quotas. That he should choose to hunt down and slaughter entire families via horseback with Blackpowder weapons is also his right. His fellow nobles will not intervene, the merchants cannot, and the commoners dare not. Will the Characters act or turn away?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ideology</h3>\n<p>Ideology is perhaps the main theme of Warhammer, but exists as a backdrop in the Empire — outside the walls is the untamed wilderness, filled with monsters and the hordes of Chaos, whilst inside them is the order of civilisation. This is, at least, how the powers that be in the Empire want it to seem, but everything exists in a liminal space between the two — Order vs Chaos. Mutants and Beastmen exist as clear evidence that it’s not black and white. Wizards represent Chaos-turned-Order. The barbarism of Witch Hunters, nominally agents of Order, is nothing short of Chaotic. The ever-present Chaos cultists — the dreaded Enemy Within — are everywhere in the Empire. This struggle is what eventually breaks the Old World in half, and leads to the End Times.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Characters are hired by faithful Shallyans to act as guards for the compassionate Doktor Carsta Velsinger, a gifted physician who administers to the poor for a pittance, but is in danger of being overrun by her many frantic would-be patients, and eliminated by agents of other less empathetic doktors who would see her ‘removed’. The real question, though, is what will the Characters do when they discover she is a mutant?<br><br></li>\n<li>Two whole villages burned, all their folk executed, for ‘heresy and acts of sedition against the Empire’ by the Witch Hunter Lothar Rieger — a man that everyone fervently praises, so long as his attention is turned elsewhere. Now, he has apparently set his sights on a village that holds friends and family of the Characters. Does Rieger even believe in innocence, or is he an agent of Chaos, unwitting or otherwise?<br><br></li>\n<li>While travelling by coach through the Reikwald, the Characters are waylaid by a large motley band but promised, in Ranald’s name, that no harm will come to them. It seems that the Outlaw Judge Jirl Strauchrichter needs some ‘objective’ jurists to help with the trial of some bandits who may have turned to Chaos and preying on their fellows. The Characters may learn some strange new ideas from Strauchrichter, who was named an Outlaw because he has odd notions, like people should be considered innocent until proven guilty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Modernisation</h3>\n<p>The Empire is in a state of industrialisation and innovation. Modernisation stretches out beyond the towns into the country increasing tensions — urban vs rural. The printing press puts reading and writing, once the purview of a select few, into the hands of commoners and pamphleteers. Black powder gives the power of the warrior elite to anyone who can point a metal tube at their neighbour and pull the trigger. Innovations in agriculture and manufacturing are seeing a glut of resources flowing into urban centres, which are becoming increasingly separate from their rural dependants. And the advances made in land and sea travel are making what was once a world of isolated pockets of civilisation into… something else. This, of course, brings resentment, and draws a far starker line between the other conflicts. Two peasants may be of the same status, but one can read, has travelled the world, and has seen the face of the Emperor, whilst the other knows only a pitchfork, immediate family, and the plot of land they are forced to work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professor Glockauer of the Imperial Engineers’ School of Altdorf has announced that he will soon unveil a radical new invention — a farming machine able to harvest whole fields in minutes. A group of Village Elders, concerned they may soon be rendered obsolete, hires the Characters to subtlety sabotage the machine so it will fail spectacularly when displayed.<br><br></li>\n<li>During a recent border skirmish between provinces, the Knights of the Sacred Flame suffered a disastrous defeat when a number of their fellows were gunned down by State Troop Handgunners. Their incensed Grand Master Feutchwanger has declared Blackpowder weapons should no longer be wielded by commoners and has already drawn many nobles sympathetic to his view. The Characters are hired by Nuln agents to convince him otherwise, or ‘remove’ him, if necessary.<br><br></li>\n<li>The Apothecary Anja Schwann has systematically expanded her business by making generic medicines using a ‘production line’ of workers. Her drugs aren’t nearly as effective as ones made following traditional ways, but they are far cheaper. The Dwarf Herbalist Kallon Rosewarden is furious with Schwann, both for abasing his work and for her business’ voracious despoiling of the herbs he needs. He hires the Characters to replace a few of Schwann’s medicines with some concoctions of his own.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Factionalism</h3>\n<p>Warhammer is filled with factions that operate under an us vs them mentality — the Elves vs the Dwarfs, the Empire vs Bretonnia, Reiklanders vs Middenlanders, Altdorfers vs Ubersreikers… Identity is everything, and unswerving allegiance to such, and the conflicts that that allegiance causes, are integral. As are the juxtapositions, stereotypes, and exceptions to that rule. Consider the stories told through the stubbornness of Dwarfs and Elves attempting to work together, or a Dwarf Slayer’s unlikely growing respect for an inexperienced Manling agitator. Often this theme is set against a backdrop of ridiculousness and farce — the conflicts are there, but if everyone just set aside their differences, things would go much smoother. And yet, there’s always someone ready to stoke those fires once more, and unpick any steps towards progress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trouble’s brewing on the docks as the Halfling Gaffers Guild recently started having their Ogre labourers haul all their building materials, bypassing the Human Stevedore Guild. The Halflings say they’ve done this because the Stevedores regularly overcharge them, while the Stevedores claim the Halflings unfairly demand that they haul as much as the Ogres can, at just as quick a pace. Both sides want the Characters’ help against the other, with each implying the real problem is just prejudice from the other side.<br><br></li>\n<li>The infamous bandit Gerlach the Gouger has finally been caught, but what should be a cause for celebration has turned nasty. As Gerlach was apprehended at a river crossing, patrols of both Road Wardens and Riverwardens are now claiming the collar, along with the heavy prize purse for catching the cruel Gouger. A fight is imminent, will the Characters help negotiate or grab the Gouger for themselves during the scuffle?<br><br></li>\n<li>The Jade Wizard Kistiane Brockdorf is tired of the endless suspicion she receives at the local market, the aggression of the Watch, and the relentless attention of the Witch Hunter Armin Geringliebe. She decides to give a series of free talks wherein she discusses the role of Wizards in the Empire and shows off a little useful Jade magic, so she hires the Characters to ‘occupy’ the Witch Hunter. The Characters soon discover that Geringliebe is anxious to attend each lecture but, strangely enough, desperate to prevent other Witch Hunters from doing so. It couldn’t be that he’s smitten with the beautiful Druid, could it?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>The Cults of the Empire’s religions are beset on all sides — fighting Chaos, monsters, magic, heresy, and each other: cult vs cult. Whether it’s Ulricans vs Sigmarites, Ulricans vs Taalites, Verenans vs Rhyans, or any other combination of conflicts, the Cults of the Empire are at each other's throats. Furthermore, the Cults are as political as any other group, and often more so than most. This leads to constant infighting, schisming, purges, synods, and other falling-outs among the Faithful. This constant squabbling from supposedly enlightened folk is a perfect symbol of the futility of the Warhammer world. The Gods may or may not be watching over us. They may or may not care what’s happening. Sure, they send us Miracles and Chosen to aid us in times of darkness… but they do nothing to keep their own houses in order, and show no signs of steering their own clergy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The poor folk of Geetberg are desperate, for a plague has afflicted them all, but the medicine needed to cure it is more costly than they can afford. A Priest of Ranald has a solution — use the silver coins interred on the eyes of the dead to save the living, but the Priests of Morr have forbidden it. Are the Characters up for some ‘noble’ graverobbing?<br><br></li>\n<li>Captain Rainer Brusdal of Middenland is offering gold to any mercenaries willing to join the final assault of a heavily fortified bandit stronghold in the Drakwald Forest. The attack will be near-suicidal as his martial advisor, Brother Ansgar, has rejected the cunning battle plan of Sister Dacia of Myrmidia as cowardly, though it would likely save many lives, in favour of an open forward assault to honour Ulric. The Sister’s plan doesn’t need many warriors though…<br><br></li>\n<li>A Warrior Priest of Sigmar, Father Helmut, has tried and convicted a squad of soldiers for failing to obey orders and abandoning their duty guarding one of Sigmar’s temples. Father Helmut doesn’t care that their town was on fire, or that lives were at stake — orders are orders. The Verenan Lorekeeper Irmgard will not let this injustice pass and, despite the potential ramifications, seeks to hire some brave souls to spirit the soldiers away before their execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The End Times?</h3>\n<p>Agitators, seers, and the insane have been declaring the end of the world for many centuries, without seeming effect, but the recent auguries are the most accurate yet. It seems the long-dreaded End Times may be at hand. What does it mean to adventure in a world seemingly headed for inevitable destruction? Are the Characters’ actions still important, or is the very notion of ‘heroics’ meaningless in the face of a looming apocalypse?</p>\n<p>Questions such as these are fundamental to the Warhammer experience, and are one of the main reasons why the focus for <strong>WFRP </strong>is on everyday people. We tell stories about a group of largely ordinary folks marked out for something extraordinary, and then get to see what happens. Will they learn of the pending doom? Will they stand against it? Will they be brought low and succumb to their baser instincts?</p>\n<p>We can’t answer these questions, nor would we, if we could. If each Campaign is built around answering a question, then <em>all </em><strong>WFRP </strong>Campaigns together are ultimately about these questions. As the GM, it’s worth presenting these questions and this theme, behind many threats, if the Characters dig deep enough.</p>\n<p>But the Old World is not without hope, nor without heroism. It’s up to your Players to decide how their Characters face the coming apocalypse and if, ultimately, they can avert it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A blind mystic accosts a Rogue Character on the street, seizes their arm, and whispers, <em>‘You will be the one to fulfil the Architect’s Plan, but it is not too late, turn back! Abandon this course while you still can!</em>’ The mystic then suddenly looks frightened and runs away. The Character is soon approached with several intriguing job offers, all of which sound very lucrative, involving thefts of holy relics. That night, they hear about an inexplicable fire that only took the life of one old witch…<br><br></li>\n<li>It is an open secret that the number of mutant births is on the rise, as are instances of spontaneous mutation. The Lady Silk Shein’s sideline business involving barber-surgeons removing ‘unwanted growths’ and ‘relocating sadly stunted babes’ is booming. She offers the Characters an exceedingly generous retainer to work for her. The job includes eliminating anyone interested in stopping the mutations or seeking their source. After all, can’t let a looming apocalypse interfere with the bottom line.<br><br></li>\n<li>Word has slipped out that in a small village deep in the Reikwald, a child has been born with birthmarks that resemble both the Twin-Tailed Comet and the dreaded Star of Chaos. Old prophecies speak of such a child, saying that they are marked for great and terrible purpose during the End Times. Now, multiple factions seek to hire the Characters to kidnap the child, protect the child, eliminate the child, etc. Whatever course they choose, someone powerful will be furious with them.</li>\n</ul>","_id":"BV0BU8yGiQ5XreF7"}

Though typically depicted as the wife of Taal, myths connect her to many gods, and she has children from many of those relationships. Most commonly portrayed as a tall, beautiful women wreathed in leaves and bedecked in fruit, Rhya’s statues are normally nude, pregnant, and surrounded by her children. Many theologians tie Rhya to the Old Faith, a prehistoric cult comprised of ancient farmers and hunters who wrested a living from the land before the Empire was born, and one still found in secluded communities to this day.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Rural folk across the Old World venerate Rhya, relying on her to provide the crops upon which their lives depends. Womanfolk comprise the main body of the cult, and most midwives pay at least lip-service to Rhya’s Wisdom, a set of oral traditions surrounding childbirth. Although she is not openly worshipped in the towns and cities — townsfolk often turning to Shallya in her stead — her name is frequently tied with Taal’s, so she is still well known amongst such people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because the cult has no great temples and protects no holy books or relics of significance, many scholars believe her worship to be declining, and possibly already dead. Her many cultists do nothing to contradict such talk.</p>\n<p>Rhya’s cultists have no fixed vestment or preferred garb, though greens are very common, as is using plants, flowers, or herbs to accessorise any clothing. They often dress in a fashion considered far too revealing by Sigmarite doctrine, which can cause friction as the Rhyans believe giving in to such prudishness is tantamount to encouraging the Prince of Excess into your lives, as it builds forbidden desires. Devotees of Sigmar invariably disagree, believing abstinence and restricting temptation is a better response to such dangers than indulgence.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Rhya has no large temples, though many ancient sites constructed from oghams (standing stones) are centres of worship for her cult, and some still echo each equinox with the cries of fevered celebrants.</p>\n<p>Shrines to Rhya are usually simple statues of the goddess, often piled high with offerings of food and drink. Older shrines are often made of small standing stones marked with worn, spiralled patterns.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Rhyan penances may involve replanting devastated areas, helping broken households, and maintaining sacred groves. It is also common to find Rhyans tasked to protect helpless families, which can often put them at odds with local bailiffs and law enforcement.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>Strictures</strong></em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Defend families, children, and crops from all harm.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never feel shame for the flesh Rhya gave you.</em></li>\n<li><em>Life is sacred, do no harm lest another life is in danger.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never judge whom another loves.</em></li>\n<li><em>Interrupt the work of the Prince of Excess wherever it may thirst</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.maUl7MoLvuvTOhM0]{Blessing of Grace}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.C92dpJPRYpkZFsGu]{Blessing of Healing}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Jkt465WPdRcejLwl]{Blessing of Recuperation}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.qB1T6ii29jreZBRP]{Rhya's Children}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.OiMiQmsv1mut24jD]{Rhya's Harvest}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.25trttu8NxFQQCo9]{Rhya's Shelter}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.pBWXlJDOE7tfl8hP]{Rhya's Succour}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0uT3mzx8v4H3gVQj]{Rhya's Touch}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.dDxhGgBBM9CugxsH]{Rhya's Union}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/rhya.webp"}

After Clemons fired the shot, he ran away. He denies picking up the gun.</p>\n<p>If the PCs leave it at this, he will destroy the box containing the powder and shot.</p>\n<p>The two clues that can prove his guilt is the top of the walking stick and the box. Both of these prove he was at the scene of the murder. The box is hidden at his house and ts engraved with Clemon&rsquo;s initials in the same style the gun is. Pallenburg carries the walking stick at all times, although he has similar sticks with different motrfs.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the PCs could bluff him with the threat of a witness.</p>\n<p>He remembers the drunk and could be forced into attempting to kill Erik or saying, \"That drunk wouldn&rsquo;t remember a thing.&rdquo; This should only occur once the PCs have done most of the investigating.</p>\n<p>It is quite possible Pallenburg will get away with the murder, even though the PCs know he has done it. Should they present the undeniable proof to him he will explain his reasons, believing the PCs will see his point of view.</p>\n<p>As to the book, he knows it was definitely there at the scene of the crime when he left, although Erik collapsed on it.

It is recorded with tokens — be these coins, cards, chits, counters, or specially designed Advantage tokens — or by a tally sheet on scrap paper.</p>\n<h3>Options: Limiting Advantage</h3>\n<p>Some GMs prefer a more controlled combat environment that isn’t so influenced by the whimsy of dice and luck. As Advantage can swing wildly during the course of a battle, and can have a significant impact, consider using one of the following optional rules if you wish to contain this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advantage has an upper level equal to each Character’s Initiative Bonus.</li>\n<li>Cap Advantage at a pre-arranged limit, such as 2, 4, or more. 10 also works well as you can easily track it with 1d10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Gaining Advantage</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advantage </strong>is secured each time you win an Opposed Test in combat, you assess the battlefield using your Skills, or when your spirits are lifted. The following provides some examples of this, but is far from exhaustive, and the GM is encouraged to hand out Advantage tokens as suits the circumstances.</li>\n<li><strong>Surprise</strong>: Attacking @Condition[Surprised] enemies brings +1 Advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Charging</strong>: Charging headlong into combat grants +1 Advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Assess</strong>: If you use one of your Skills to secure a tactical advantage, gain +1 Advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Victory</strong>: Whenever you defeat an important NPC, gain Advantage. Subduing a party nemesis may grant +2 Advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Winning</strong>: If you win an Opposed Test during combat gain&nbsp;Advantage.</li>\n<li><strong>Outmanouevre</strong>: If you wound an opponent without engaging in an Opposed Test, gain +1 Advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Benefits of Advantage</h4>\n<p>Each Advantage you secure adds +10 to any appropriate combat Test or Psychology Test. Thus, if you have 5 Advantage tokens, you have an impressive +50 bonus to hit, defend, and resist the influence of others.</p>\n<h4>Losing Advantage</h4>\n<p>If you lose an Opposed Test during combat, suffer any Conditions, or lose any Wounds, you automatically lose all Advantage. Further, should the combat end, all Advantage you’ve gained is lost. Lastly, if you have accrued no Advantage for the Round, or end the Round outnumbered, you lose 1 point. Advantage can also be used to Disengage from combat. There are also Skills and Talents that cause you to lose Advantage, or transfer Advantage to another character.</p>","_id":"EqJoeR63GVbZ8OWp"}

A list of all Skills and Talents is provided in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents. The Skills and Talents you have available to you at character generation are determined by your Species and Career.</p>\n<p>When you learn a Skill, note down the number of Advances you gain in the Advances box of the Skill. If you should learn this skill again, add the extra Advances to the old total to create a new number of Advances. If you learn a Talent, record it in your Talent list on your Character Sheet.</p>\n<p>Skills are classified as either <em>Basic </em>or <em>Advanced </em>. Basic Skills represent common abilities that everyone can perform &mdash; you can use these skills without any Advances in them, at a level equal to the governing characteristic.

Any Random Talents are determined by the Random Talent table. If you roll a Talent you already have, you may reroll. <strong>Note</strong>: All Characters are assumed to be fluent in Reikspiel,, the language of the Empire, and do not need to take it as a Skill.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong><em>The Species skills/talents are shown via the '/char' command, as well as the random talents.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Career Skills and Talents</h3>\n<p>You begin at the first Career level listed in your Career Path.

This is enough for you to add 5 Advances to every Career Skill if you wish, which is one of the required steps to complete your Career if you wish to move to a new one (see Changing Career on page 48). You may also choose a single Talent to learn.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:<em> Lindsay is creating a Human Noble Scion, which has the following Career Skills: Bribery, Consume Alcohol, Gamble, Intimidate, Leadership, Lore (Heraldry), Melee (Fencing), Play (Any).

Note: Lindsay can do this even if she has already allocated Advances to Leadership for being Human, as the limit of 10 Advances to a single Skill applies only during this allocation of 40 Advances.</em></p>","_id":"FOwE3F63OT83lSgV"}

For the Rogues in your party, two schemes concerning coins are worth knowing.</p>\n<h4>Counterfeiting</h4>\n<p>The diversity of coinage circulating the Empire means counterfeiting is rife. Reiklanders may be accustomed to seeing coins from other provinces, but are always wary of being scammed. A successful Evaluate Test will detect counterfeit coins, typically by inspecting coins for weight and hardness.</p>\n<p>Actually producing counterfeit coins is much harder. It requires an Art (Engraving) Test to carve a convincing stamping die, then a Trade (Blacksmith) Test to strike the coins, usually with the aid of an assistant. Including a higher precious metal content makes Evaluate Tests to detect counterfeits more difficult; using less than a fifth makes it much easier to spot the fake coins.</p>\n<h4>Clipping</h4>\n<p>Embezzlers can trim slivers of precious metal away from the edges of coins. This scam is called ‘clipping’ or ‘shaving’ and is practised mainly by shopkeepers or tollkeepers who have access to large quantities of other peoples’ money. Gold and silver filings are then melted down and sold to jewellers, counterfeiters, or fences. Clipped coins can be detected with the Evaluate Skill; the more of the coin that’s clipped, the easier the Test.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>The Nuln Standard</em></h3>\n<p><em>Altdorf may be the current capital of Reikland and the Empire, but coinage standards are established in the city-state of Nuln to the south. Historically, Nuln was the Empire’s capital until House Holswig-Schliestein restored the throne to Altdorf a century ago, and many imperial institutions still call that city home. The Nuln Standard only governs coin weight and metallurgy, not stamp imagery, which varies significantly across the provinces.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"Ge7BuImLEwzDFhnp"}

This chapter shows you how to make your own Character from scratch. Most begin the game as unremarkable inhabitants of the Empire &mdash; possibly destined for greatness, but no-one would guess it. That&rsquo;s not to say you can&rsquo;t rise from humble origins, just that you&rsquo;ve got a long journey ahead, and that you&rsquo;ll probably need a better pair of boots.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All the information describing your Character&rsquo;s abilities is recorded on a Character Sheet. We provide ready-made Characters and sheets in the <strong>WFRP Starter Set</strong>, and online at cubicle7.co.uk. Using ready-made Characters is a great way to start playing and find out how the game works, but sooner or later you&rsquo;ll want to create your own from the ground up.</p>\n<p>When deciding what your Character will be like, discuss the kind of group you want to create with the other players. This makes sure that the group&rsquo;s Characters complement each other and that together you will have a broad and versatile range of abilities. Your GM may also have a particular kind of game in mind, and you&rsquo;ll need to make sure you have the right mix of Characters. Perhaps the GM plans for you to join a group of apprentice wizards who know one another at the Colleges of Magic? Maybe you are part of a unit of soldiers who have all deserted? Or maybe you are one of a disparate band of Reiklanders press-ganged into service by a powerful noble? Knowing this is important to help you build a suitable character which will be more fun to play.</p>\n<h3>Creating a Character</h3>\n<p>In some sections, you can either choose an option or accept the result of a dice roll to make the choice for you. You may receive bonus Experience Points (XP) for choosing to accept random&nbsp;outcomes, as if the Dark Gods of Chaos themselves applaud your acceptance of random chance. XP represent learning from experience and are the principal way to improve your abilities &mdash; you will be able to spend these points to enhance your character&rsquo;s abilities. XP are covered in more detail in @JournalEntry[Advancement].&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Class and Career</h2>\n<p>Your Class determines your general place in society. Your Career describes your current job and determines your Status, which also influences how much money you earn.</p>\n<p>You can simply choose your Class and Career from the options below, write them down on your Character Sheet and move on to step 3. Alternatively, if you are unsure which to choose, or just want to randomly select for bonus XP:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Roll 1d100 on the @Table[career]{Random Class and Career Table}. If you don&rsquo;t like the result, move to step 2. If you keep the result, gain +50 XP.</li>\n<li>Roll twice more on the table, bringing your total to 3 choices. If one of the three now suits you, select one and gain +25 XP. If not, move to Step 3.</li>\n<li>Choose your Class and Career, or keep rerolling on the table until you get something you like.

That's Not Fair!</em></h3>\n<p><em>You may notice that not all characters are created equal. An Elf has significant Characteristic advantages, for example. Don&rsquo;t be deceived by numbers alone, there are many aspects to character generation and all the Species have advantages and disadvantages at each stage, some of them not always obvious.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>CHARACTERISTICS</h3>\n<p>Your ten Characteristics are used in Tests, to determine if you perform an action successfully. The Human average for these Attributes is 30. Those who are gifted, or well-practiced, may achieve scores of over 40; only the most dedicated and experienced will achieve scores over 60. Of course, other Species have their own strengths and weaknesses, so their averages are different, sometimes significantly so.</p>\n<p>Determining Characteristics</p>\n<p>When determining your Characteristics:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Step 1) Roll 2d10 for each of the ten Characteristics and make a note of the results. If you feel your Character would be improved if you swapped round some of the dice roll results between Characteristics, move to the next step. If you stick with your random results, add the die rolls to the modifier for each Characteristic from the Attribute Table, write them on your Character Sheet and gain +50 XP.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Step 2) Rearrange the ten numbers rolled under step 1, assigning each to a different Characteristic (and adding its modifier). If you&rsquo;re happy with this new mix, record them on your Character Sheet and gain +25 XP. If not, move to the next step.</p>\n<p>Step 3) If you&rsquo;re still not happy with your results, either roll again and swap the rolls around with no XP bonus, or you could ignore the dice completely! Instead, allocate 100 points across the 10 Characteristics as you prefer, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 18 allocated to any single Characteristic. Add the modifiers from the Attribute Table and record them on your Character Sheet. Like rolling again, there is no XP bonus for this option.</p>\n<p>Weapon Skill (WS)</p>\n<p>Your skill at fighting hand-to-hand, your ability to land a measured blow, and effectiveness in the free-for-all of a massed melee.

In that time, I have been attacked thrice, robbed twice, offered partnerships four times, and ignored by soldiers twice. I have also hidden from war parties six times, Human and otherwise, and fled those who would do me harm more times than I can count. Not once have I met someone who offered me a smile and a kind word without an ulterior motive. Everyone here has his own plan and will happily lie, cheat, steal, flatter, cajole, and murder to get it.</p>\n<p>How do people live like this?</p>\n<p>When not faced with other people, I have found the mountains bleak but not altogether unpleasant. The peaks are austere, stripped clean of plants and dirt by the ever-present wind, and the rock is good granite, strong and sturdy and sharp-edged. The sky is clear most days, a piercing blue broken only by the sun, and I would be sweltering in my leathers if not for the bracing wind. The footing is firm, the cliffs and ledges solid, and many small clearings exist for the nightly fire I must have to drive away the chill that settles in once the sun falls below the horizon. A man could be content walking these mountains all his life, admiring the rough beauty of the land here and the broad expanse stretching away below.</p>\n<p>Yet I am not here to be swayed by landscape, nor to cut myself off from the world. I am here seeking treasure, and my satisfaction or frustration can only be measured by my success in that endeavour.</p>\n<p>And thus far, I am most frustrated.</p>\n<p>I have not seen a single structure since I climbed the pass&mdash;no ruins, no chiselled stones, no remnants of door or wall or roof. Beyond the pass itself, I have found no trace that people have walked these peaks.</p>\n<p>Yet I know it must be here!</p>\n<p>My source claimed the tomb was within these mountains. That is why it had never been plundered, he said, because it is high above the reach of most thieves. They dig through the Borderlands, unearthing minor barrows and crypts, but the greatest tombs were fashioned here among the cliffs, where they could rest undisturbed for all eternity.</p>\n<p>Well, I mean to disturb them plenty.</p>\n<h2>Journal entry, day 50</h2>\n<p>When I awoke this morning it was with every intention of surrender. After more than two weeks here, climbing like some foolish goat from peak to peak, I have discovered nothing more valuable than a few chunks of granite. My source was either mistaken or deliberately false, and I have wasted time and valuable resources on a fool&rsquo;s errand. I will not compound my error further. Instead I will set out toward the pass again and descend from there to what the locals laughably refer to as civilisation. From there I can take a boat back up river and leave this desolate land behind me once and for all.</p>\n<p>Such was my intent. But plans never go as intended, and oft times that is for the best.</p>\n<p>As I clambered up yet another peak, seeking a view of the pass that I might orient myself, I spied something else instead. A flash of dull white, almost blinding in the glare of the rising sun and clearly visible against the dark granite. What could that be, I wondered? Ignoring caution, for after so many close calls here I have grown almost foolhardy to the notion of danger, I slid down the peak and moved as quickly as possible along an intervening ledge.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later, I was peering down into a tiny valley, really little more than a gash in the rock. And I was glad I had not given in to my first impulse to slide down there without first studying what might wait at the bottom.</p>\n<p>What I saw curdled my blood and froze my feet in place. My limbs felt heavy, my breath hot, and I could feel the sweat springing from my forehead to stream over my unblinking eyes. I might have screamed if my tongue had not turned to stone and my mouth filled with dust.</p>\n<p>Below me stood men.</p>\n<p>At least, those who had once been men.</p>\n<p>Now they were little more than bones, held together by some arcane art, yet still moving. It had been one of those bones, the flesh long since picked away, that I had seen from my previous perch. These were mere Skeletons, yet they walked&mdash;no, they marched&mdash;as I had seen soldiers do all too recently.</p>\n<p>And each Skeleton bore arms&mdash;swords and spears, with wicked blades, their edges untarnished. Several of the walking bones also carried helmets, breastplates, bracers, even greaves. It was as if a military patrol had been stripped of flesh without realizing it, and so they marched on, unaware of their own demise.</p>\n<p>I would have run, if I could. I would have stumbled backward on that ledge, until I was hidden from view, and then fled from that horrible sight, going anywhere as long as it was away. I could feel my sanity slipping as I gazed again upon these creatures, these mockeries of life. Yet, fear froze me, and I could not turn away.</p>\n<p>And for that I am forever grateful.</p>\n<p>For as I stared, I noticed something I had missed in my initial terror. The arms, the armour, they bore markings I had seen before. The style of the weapons, the materials used, the shape of the buckles holding greaves and bracers and breastplates in place&mdash;all these were familiar. I had seen them in paintings and on scrolls.</p>\n<p>They were the gear of Nehekharan soldiers.</p>\n<p>And if these monstrosities were Nehekharan, that could only mean one thing.</p>\n<p>The tomb I sought was nearby.</p>\n<h2>Journal entry, day 55</h2>\n<p>It was five days ago that I first sighted the walking dead. The fact that I can write that phrase with only a tiny shudder shows how numbed I have become to their horror.</p>\n<p>In that time, I have been careful to remain hidden from their patrols. I have watched, half-buried by loose rock, as the Skeletons marched past. I have lain beneath dirt and stone, while the creatures passed so close I could make out the hieroglyphs etched into their armour. If they breathed, I would have heard the rasp of their breath mere feet from my hiding places. Fortunately, these creatures seem less alert than their living counterparts&mdash;they have no noses, no ears, no eyes, after all, and while they are visibly alert to movement, they do not notice the subtle signs of my presence a living scout might have seen. Their empty sockets have scanned past my concealment many times, but not once have they paused.</p>\n<p>And for that I count myself among the luckiest of men.</p>\n<p>Two days ago, I saw others who were not so lucky. Three men were leading two donkeys laden with wares. Why they had forsaken the pass I do not know&mdash;perhaps it was to avoid the bandits who sometimes roam there. If so, they would have been safer with such thieves. The Skeleton Soldiers heard their approach, as did I, for in truth they made little attempt at stealth. The Undead turned as one and marched toward the sound, weapons raised. I crept behind, hoping they would not turn back, and indeed they did not, for the monsters were wholly occupied with their mission. They fell upon those travellers without a sound&mdash;no shouts, no curses, no bellows&mdash;only the dull clank of bone against metal.</p>\n<p>One of the travellers looked up and saw the Skeletons before they struck. He screamed and fell back against the lead donkey, scrabbling for the sword at his side, but the Undead were upon him before he could draw. A bronze axe rose and fell, lodging itself in the man&rsquo;s shoulder and chest, and he collapsed in a gush of blood.</p>\n<p>The bloodletting seemed to rouse something in the walking dead, and the ferocity of their attacks increased. They surrounded the travellers, blades stabbing and slicing and chopping, and before I could do more than crouch behind a rock, all three men had fallen. But the attack did not stop there. The Skeletons continued to strike, hacking without pause, and by the time they turned away, there was little left beyond hunks of flesh and a spreading pool of blood. The donkeys had panicked at the first smell of blood and had bolted, and I was surprised the Skeletons did not pursue them. Perhaps they felt mere pack animals were beneath their notice. I know I could scarcely breath as I flattened myself against the ground and prayed they did not retrace their steps, for if they did, I knew I would be next. But Ulric smiled upon me, and the fiends continued on across the narrow path the ill-fated travellers had found, scaling the cliff face beyond and vanishing over the ridge. Only then did my hands unclench and my mouth open to gulp at the cold mountain air.</p>\n<p>Never have I seen such ferocity, such single-mindedness, as that attack. I shudder to think what would happen were more such creatures to emerge from the tomb that must house them.</p>\n<p>But not all is gloom for me. Today I spied the Skeletons again and I followed them from a distance, careful to stay far enough back they would not detect my presence. Every time I thought they might see me, I ducked down behind rocks and waited several breaths before peering about. Fortunately, they are easy to spot against the dark granite, and I do not need to be close to mark their path.</p>\n<p>After several long hours, the skeletal patrol completed its rounds. I watched as they entered a small, circular valley&mdash;and disappeared through a crack in the western cliff wall! I waited several minutes and then, when nothing else had stirred, slid down to the valley floor. From this vantage I could see markings and shadows on that cliff face. They were clearly manmade.</p>\n<p>Looking more closely, I made out rough columns on either side of that crack. Detail was long since gone, worn away by wind and rain, but the shapes were there. And the crack was too straight, too even to be natural. Around it on both sides and above was a wide, shallow bump that ran even across the top and then smoothly down on both sides. It was a doorframe! The crack was no mere split in rock but the gap in a partially opened door!</p>\n<p>I knew for certain, and my heart sang with joy, when I spied the cartouche set near the junction between wall and floor, off to the left side. The hieroglyphs there were badly worn, but I could see enough to recognize them as Nehekharan and to make out the symbol for &ldquo;king.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I had found the tomb at last!</p>\n<p>Before the entrance to the tomb I discovered a stele inscribed with various languages, including Nehekharan and the runes of the Dwarfs. I have taken a rubbing. Perhaps it will be worth something to a scholar back in the Empire.</p>\n<h2>Journal entry, day 62</h2>\n<p>The tomb, the tomb! It haunts my dreams! I shall never escape those carvings, those murals, those lifelike statues!</p>\n<p>Within the entry chamber was a circular mosaic with a large scarab of black onyx set at its centre. The ceiling was decorated to show a miniature of the night sky and the walls were lined with statues of warriors in armour.</p>\n<p>The next contained a multiude of doors guarded by armoured skeletons who thankfully were immobile.</p>\n<p>The third chamber was a great hall, desiccated corpses posed upon benches or leaning on pillars in some obscene mockery of life.</p>\n<p>It was from this chamber that I discovered the chamber of sarcophagi. Twelve in total, they each bore a plaque and tapestry depicting their deeds in life. And each contained more riches than I had ever seen before. Much of it I had to leave behind, lacking as I did a pack animal to hold it. But I recorded the items contained within each sarcophagus and took a rubbing of each cartouche. They were as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 1]</strong></p>\n<p>Three ebony fingers.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 2]</strong></p>\n<p>A crystal eye, a false nose, ears and lips made from gold.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 3]</strong></p>\n<p>A jewelled arm.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 4]</strong></p>\n<p>A silver leg inlaid with jade and lapis lazuli.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 5]</strong></p>\n<p>A pewter torso, padded with silk.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 6]</strong></p>\n<p>A set of ivory teeth, a wooden arm and a clay foot.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 7]</strong></p>\n<p>Two ebony legs.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 8]</strong></p>\n<p>An ornate wig and a golden ear horn.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 9]</strong></p>\n<p>A black onyx hand.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 10]</strong></p>\n<p>A silver and marble face mask.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 11]</strong></p>\n<p>A wooden head, arms, body and leg.</p>\n<p><strong>[Cartouche 12]</strong></p>\n<p>A gold tongue and silver eyes.</p>\n<p>In that same chamber I discovered a golden sword in the hands of what I can only imagine to be a very unlucky tomb robber of some distant age. He did not manage to get very far with it, as I assume it came from that very same chamber. I took that with me in the hope it might afford some protection for the journey out of the damned valley.</p>"}

The council meets weekly in the Wilhelm Chamber of the Volkshalle in Altdorf to discuss matters of import. It is rare for more than six of the high lords to attend simultaneously, and almost unheard of for the prince to attend in person.</p>\n<h4>The High Lords of the Reikland</h4>\n<p>The Ten High Lords of the Council of the Reikland, are appointed by the grand prince. Whilst most commoners could never hope to encounter such luminaries, their agents and representatives can be found everywhere.</p>\n<h4>High Lord of the Chair</h4>\n<p>A close advisor to the grand prince, the High Lord of the Chair officially leads the Reikland Council in the elector count&rsquo;s stead.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord of the Chair, the stoic Graf Archibold von @JournalEntry[AhL154uxwRaa2157]{Lilahalle}, was granted the influential position after being gravely wounded whilst saving the life of Emperor Luitpold III from an assassin&rsquo;s blade. Lingering, painful injuries confine him to a steam-driven wheelchair; an irony only the unwise note aloud.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Steward</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Steward is the only man legally allowed to judge a crime committed by the lord of a Reikland Estate. As a High Lord Stewart&rsquo;s Court is rarely called &mdash; most lords being simply too powerful to call to task &mdash; the position is largely ceremonial. Nevertheless, the High Lord Steward is arguably the most senior High Lord, and often stands in for the Grand Prince when he is unable &mdash; or unwilling &mdash; to attend court.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Steward is Archduke Adelbert von B&ouml;genberg, a quiet man with little experience of the law, but a shrewd understanding of people. As much of the grand prince&rsquo;s time is taken up with imperial matters, he is arguably the&nbsp; de facto&nbsp; ruler of the Reikland, much to the High Lord of the Chair&rsquo;s chagrin.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Treasurer</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Treasurer is responsible for the Reikland&rsquo;s treasury and for raising revenues. The position is extraordinarily important and is almost always held by a close ally of the crown.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Treasurer is the aging genius Grafina Elena von Midwald, a dear friend of the previous grand prince, well known for her outspoken appreciation of fine wine and fine men.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Ambassador</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Ambassador organises the Reikland&rsquo;s foreign relations and runs the Altdorf Black Chamber: the infamous spies of the Reikland.</p>\n<p>Graf Liepmund Holzkrug, the current High Lord Ambassador, is an intense, fiercely ambitious man, whose family are strong rivals to House Holswig-Schliestein in Altdorf. He is known for his vindictive nature, his ruthless politics, and his love of hunting rare and exotic game.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Judge</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Judge is the ultimate voice on all Reiklander Law, which is quite different from Imperial Law.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Judge of the Reikland also serves as Supreme Law Lord of the Empire: Lector Agatha von @JournalEntry[eFOFM7fsXgfThWnV]{B&ouml;hrn} of Verena. She is experienced in all legal matters, and widely regarded as one of the most intelligent people in the Empire, especially by those who have bribed her.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Chancellor</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Chancellor is the crown&rsquo;s spiritual advisor, and oversees the Reikland Chancery and the Silver Seal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Chancellor is High Priestess Halma Habermann of Sigmar, a robust woman with a pale complexion, rosy cheeks, and thick limbs. Though generally charming and approachable, she is zealously out-spoken in her opposition to the Colleges of Magic, and rumours abound regarding the atrocities she witnessed during her service in the Order of the Silver Hammer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>High Lord Chamberlain</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Chamberlain runs the Palace of Altdorf and the adjoining Volkshall. The position is arguably one of the most influential in the Reikland, as most high-level imperial politics take place within the chamberlain&rsquo;s domain.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Chamberlain is rake-thin Duchess Elze von Skaag, an astute negotiator and careful planner who publicly supports Emperor Karl-Franz in all matters. Elze&rsquo;s husband, Duke Alardus von Skaag, is said to be deeply frustrated at his wife residing in Altdorf and not in Skaggerdorf with him; by comparison, it seems to suit her perfectly as most evenings she can be found carousing through the city with her bodyguards.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Reiksmarshal</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Reiksmarshal is responsible for leading the armies of the Reikland, and ensuring each of the Reikland State Regiments is raised, financed, and made available to the crown as required.</p>\n<p>The current Reiksmarshal is the veteran general Duke Kurt Helborg, close friend and tutor to the current grand prince &mdash; Emperor Karl-Franz &mdash; and said to be the finest swordsman&nbsp;in the Empire. Helborg&rsquo;s military commitments ensure that he rarely takes his seat on the council, a circumstance that suits his natural inclination.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Constable</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Constable is the ultimate authority on the genealogy and heraldry of the Reikland.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Constable is smiling Grafina Matrella von Achern, a woman with no interest in genealogy, but a voracious appetite for political intrigue. She has made the most of this relatively inconsequential position, by chairing several private councils on the Grand Prince&rsquo;s behalf. It is hard to reconcile the bubbly, maternal demeanour she projects, and her reputation amongst her peers as the most ruthless woman in the Reikland.</p>\n<h4>High Lord Admiral</h4>\n<p>The High Lord Admiral is responsible for the Admiralty of the Reik, and thus the entire Reikland navy.</p>\n<p>The current High Lord Admiral is the venerable Sea Lord Adalmann von @JournalEntry[mDwaCu4nzY0wHVWY]{Hopfberg}.

Barely any non-Halflings live in the district. Many of the buildings are Halfling-sized, and built to a homely rustic aesthetic. Newer buildings follow this trend. Old Big buildings are simply given extra floors by bisecting the original levels. Ubiquitous pot plants, small but thriving gardens, brightly painted buildings, coloured awnings, small ponies instead of horses, the scent of herbs, make the transition from the Big city to Haffenstadt unmistakable.</p>\n<p>Just as any visitor from the wider Reikland might find Altdorf uncomfortably overcrowded, Haffenstadt can seem unnaturally crowded to other Altdorfers. This is due to its tight enclosure on three sides by the looming city walls, its many tall and narrow buildings, and the bustling populace. Halflings, by nature, are sociable and gregarious and feel comfortable in these cramped conditions. A postern gate leads right into the heart of Haffenstadt, so first-time visitors to the city entering here get a strange first impression.</p>\n<p>Officially part of Grandmarkt, the Halflings of Haffenstadt consider the area to be its own distinct district. They are trying to convince the council of Grandmarkt to give them such independence. They have already set up their own &lsquo;shadow&rsquo; town council at the Quinsberry Manor with its own burgomeister. The burgomeister, Harpal Chard, struts around in his regalia as if his position were the most official thing in the city.

Forenames include:</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Adhemar, Anders, Artur, Beatrijs, Clementia, Detlev, Erika, Frauke, Frederich, Gerner, Gertraud, Haletha, Heinrich, Helga, Henryk, Irmina, Jehanne, Karl, Kruger, Lorelay, Marieke, Sebastien, Sigfreda, Talther, Talunda, Ulrich, Ulrika, Werther, Willelma, Wilryn.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Human Names And Their Origins</em></h3>\n<p><em>Human names in WFRP are often taken from the real world, making it easy to research fun names online. The Reikland and much of The Empire uses Germanic names, the Wasteland has Dutch and Belgian influences, and Bretonnian names are loosely medieval French.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong>: Use the /name command to generate names.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Reikland, Human family surnames passed on from one generation to the next are most common in cities and towns, while in villages Humans are more likely to take on an individual surname when they reach adulthood. It&rsquo;s common to take a surname from where you were born, such as &lsquo;Wilhelm of Auerswald&rsquo;. The nobility often have two surnames, one is the name of their House and the other is preceded by &lsquo;von&rsquo; to indicate where their family holds land, such as Graf Zenechar Trott von Tahme, though individual family traditions vary widely.</p>\n<p>The most common surnames are derived from your occupation, or the occupation of a parent or grandparent. Examples include: Bauer (Farmer), Fleischer (Butcher), Schmidt (Smith), and Schuster (Cobbler). If a character has a particularly noticeable physical trait, this might be used as a surname. This can often be passed down from parents to children too, which can become confusing for literal-minded Dwarfs who may not understand a short person claiming to be Lang (Tall). Some other examples include: Augenlos (one eye), Dunn (very thin), Laut (loud voice), Stark (Strong).</p>\n<h3>Dwarf Names</h3>\n<p>Dwarf names are comprised of a forename, a surname, and a clan name.</p>\n<h4>Dwarf Forenames</h4>\n<p>Dwarf names tend to be short and sturdy like the people they represent, and are most commonly given to celebrate important ancestors, although individual clan traditions vary. Another common practice is to use a birthname to describe a key trait of a newborn in Khazalid, the Dwarf native language.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Alrik, Bronda, Dimzad, Fenna, Gottri, Gudrun, Snorri.</p>\n<p><strong>Khazalid examples</strong>: Baragaz (Cannon Mouth), Durak (Hard), Galazil (Golden Haired), Gnoldok (Wise Eyes), Nazril&nbsp;(Shimmering), Okri (Crafter)</p>\n<h4>Dwarf Surnames</h4>\n<p>Dwarf surnames are based on who raised the Dwarf, with the following suffixes the most common in use:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sdottir: Daughter of&hellip;</li>\n<li>snev: Nephew of&hellip;</li>\n<li>sniz: Niece of&hellip;</li>\n<li>sson: Son of&hellip;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Ariksson, Grunnasdottir, Skagnev, Sovrissniz</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s common as Dwarfs age and accrue deeds to their names to adopt a nickname based on physical appearance, prowess, or deed. These are usually bestowed by clan consensus, and it&rsquo;s considered dishonourable to give a name that doesn&rsquo;t represent the true character of a Dwarf. If such a nickname is adopted, it usually replaces the surname completely. So, Gerka Kardadottir would become Gerka Blackhand if she took the nickname &lsquo;Blackhand&rsquo;. Sometimes a nickname is marked in Khazalid, but Dwarfs usually translate such to Reikspiel in order to better explain themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Axebringer, Finehand, Forkbeard, Ironbraid, Redhammer, Stonefist</p>\n<h4>Clan Name</h4>\n<p>Finally, all Dwarfs bear a Clan Name (assuming they have not abandoned Dwarf tradition, which some Dwarfs living in the Empire have, especially rogue engineers). The Clan Name is always derived from the ancestor who founded the Clan, and is often sourced in a Nickname, often expressed in Khazalid. In practice, Dwarfs rarely use their Clan Name outside Dwarf society.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Reikland Clans</strong>: Ardrungan, Bryntok, Gazani, Gromheld, Harrazlings, Unboki</p>\n<p><strong>Common Grey Mountain Clans</strong>: Dokkintroll, Ganvalgger, Kvitang, Thrungtak, Wyrgrinti, Zankonk</p>\n<h4>Elf Names</h4>\n<p>Elves normally only admit to having names comprising of a forename and an epithet when wandering the Reikland.</p>\n<p><strong>Elf Forenames</strong></p>\n<p>The Elves use a naming system quite incomprehensible to outsiders. Eltharin (the common language of High Elves and Wood Elves, which has many dialects) is a language that relies on more than simple syllables to convey meaning. The easiest way to create an Elf name is to use the Elf Name Generator.</p>\n<p><strong>Elf Epithets</strong></p>\n<p>When travelling foreign lands, Elves typically present themselves with a forename and an epithet rather than attempt to explain the deeper concepts of Kindreds, Kinbands, or Houses. These epithets are always translated into Reikspiel as they are much easier for other species to pronounce and understand. Among High Elves, epithets usually describe character traits and physical appearance, but can be more obscure. Wood Elf epithets typically reference the natural world so beloved by the forest kin.</p>\n<p><strong>High Elf examples</strong>: Emberfell, Fireborn, Foamheart, Goldenhair, Silverspray, Spellsign</p>\n<p><strong>Wood Elf examples</strong>: Fleetriver, Shadowstalker, Treeshaper, Weavewatcher, Willowlimb, Windrunner</p>\n<h4>Halfling Names</h4>\n<p>Halfling names are comprised of a given name and a clan name at a minimum, with middle names included to ensure family trees are not confused.</p>\n<p><strong>Halfling Forenames</strong></p>\n<p>Halflings proudly bear grand names drawn from their long family trees, but they rarely use these outside official business. Normally, they are known by a cosy-sounding shortened form of their ancestral name. Some Halfling&rsquo;s diminutives are completely unrelated to their formal names and are instead more descriptive, like Rosie or Scrumper.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Halflings place great stock in their achievements and some elders will only answer to nicknames related to their job, such as Gaffer, Guv, or Nan. Halflings also have long had a habit of emulating their neighbours to the point that many grand, formerly-Human names have now become &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; Halfling names.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Examples (with diminutives)</strong>: Antoniella (Anni), Esmerelda (Esme), Ferdinand (Fred), Heironymus (Hiro), Maximilian (Max), Theodosius (Theo), Thomasina (Tina)</p>\n<h4>Halfling Clan Names</h4>\n<p>Halfling clan names are almost exclusively related to food and drink, geographical or natural features, or personal characteristics of the ancestor who first took the name. Halflings who have the same surname are always related and can usually tell you exactly how.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Human&rsquo;s tendency to have the same surname despite being unrelated causes confusion among some Halflings, who will happily pinch pies from a Schmidt on one street because a Schmidt on another street short-changed them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Common Reikland Clans</strong>: Ashfield, Brandysnap, Hayfoot, Rumster, Shortbottom, Thorncobble</p>\n<h3>Physical Details</h3>\n<p>When it comes to cosmetic physical details &mdash; those aspects of your appearance that don&rsquo;t influence the game directly &mdash; you may either roll them randomly or choose from the range available to your Species.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Age</h4>\n<p>Average natural lifespans are around 60 for a Human, 120 for Halflings, and over 200 for a Dwarf, while Elves don&rsquo;t appear to age at all and have been known to live for a thousand years or more. Choose your Character&rsquo;s age or use the /char command.</p>\n<h4>Eye Colour</h4>\n<p>While most species roll once on the table below, Elves may roll twice: their innately magical natures mean they often have variegated colours, such as sapphire blue flecked with gold, or a mottled mixture of mossy green and warm chestnut.</p>\n<p>@Table[eyes]</p>\n<h4>Hair Colour</h4>\n<p>All species barring Elves have hair that slowly turns grey as they move through middle age, then eventually turns white as they reach old age.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By comparison, Elves seem eternally youthful, never showing any signs of age. Humans and Dwarfs may also have significant facial hair, which is usually the same colour as head hair, but not always.</p>\n<p>@Table[hair]</p>\n<h4>Height</h4>\n<p>Average heights are: Dwarf (4&rsquo;8&rdquo;), Elf (6&rsquo;5&rdquo;), Halfling (3&rsquo;6&rdquo;), with Humans varying much more widely, averaging somewhere around 5&rsquo;9&rdquo; in the Reikland. If you want a truly random upper height for Humans, if either die rolls a 10, roll one more die and add it to the height total.</p>\n<p>Use /char to generate height.</p>\n<h3>Ambitions</h3>\n<p>Ambitions are a Character&rsquo;s goals in life &ndash; what they want to achieve. All characters have both a Short-Term and Long-Term Ambition.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Choosing Ambitions</h4>\n<p>Consult with your GM when choosing your Ambitions. Your GM has final say on the acceptability of an Ambition, and whether it is short-term or long-term. Should you wish to change an Ambition, you may do so between sessions.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Short-term Ambitions</h4>\n<p>Short-term Ambitions represent your immediate goals. They are outcomes you wish to achieve within days and weeks, possibly sooner. Under normal circumstances, a short-term Ambition should take at least two or three sessions to complete.</p>\n<p>Example short-term Ambitions include:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ruining the reputation of a romantic rival.</li>\n<li>Avenging a fallen comrade.</li>\n<li>Befriending a reclusive scholar.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Long-term Ambitions</h4>\n<p>Long-term Ambitions are goals you will need to work on for months or years to complete, and may never be achieved at all, perhaps taken more as a description of a primary motivation in your life than a realistic outcome.</p>\n<p>Examples of long-term Ambitions include:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Owning your own coaching inn.</li>\n<li>Building your village into a thriving town.</li>\n<li>Ridding the Colleges of Magic of Elven influence.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Nefarious Plans</em></h3>\n<p><em>You may want to keep your Ambitions secret from other players in your party, especially if they are controversial or clandestine. If you want to overthrow the Emperor, or legalise Necromancy in the Reikland, chances are your Witch Hunter ally won&rsquo;t approve!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Achieving Your Ambitions</h4>\n<p>If you achieve your short-term Ambition, you will receive a bonus of +50 XP, and can choose a new short-term Ambition at the end of the session.&nbsp; If you achieve your long-term Ambition, you may either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receive a bonus of +500 XP and choose a new long-term Ambition at the end of the session.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Retire your Character &mdash; who becomes an NPC under your GM&rsquo;s control &mdash; and gain a bonus of half your earned XP of your current character to spend on your next character.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Retired Characters will generally stay in place to take advantage of their achieved ambition. You can build them into the background of your new Character, so that they may continue to help you. If you want to reactivate a retired Character, talk to your GM about how best to bring that into the current story. Retiring Characters allows you to build a network across the Old World, and can be a great source of adventure leads.&nbsp;</p>","_id":"JBOYi8HqD07VmHPN"}

There are High Elves with diplomatic positions in Karl-Franz I&rsquo;s court, as well as traders and merchant princes in many of the great cities of the Empire, but the majority of the Asur avoid entanglements with Humans (not to mention Dwarfs) and few would call a Reiklander &lsquo;friend&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wood Elves are even more removed; nearly mythical, rarely seen, and when they do appear they always have their own concerns that they rarely share with others.</p>\n<p>Between adventures, all Elven characters must undertake one Endeavour maintaining contact with their own kind, seeing to their responsibilities to their people. High Elves commonly give reports on interesting things they&rsquo;ve learned to agents of Ulthuan in either Altdorf or Marienburg, whereas Asrai do the same with the spies from their arboreal homes. This Endeavour offers no advantage beyond the inherent advantage of being an Elf. Note: Elves only lose an Endeavour if the Between Adventures section is at least 3 weeks long, thus the Elves have at least 3 Endeavours to complete.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic;\"><strong><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Elf Esteem</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">You will note high-ranking Elven characters who do not wish to lose Career status will only be able to undertake a single &lsquo;free&rsquo; Endeavour.

So declaimed by Fra Albus Dominus of Wolfenburg, priest of Sigmar, this three hundredth day of the year 2510, to a great congregation of good folk in the high temple of that burg, and writ down as perfect testimony by R. Josephus, rubricator. Commend me, oh lord, to his Imperial Majesty Karl Franz, hammer of the heathens, everlasting in Sigmar&rsquo;s grace, world without end.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Gather close and listen now, be you ploughman or warrior, high-born or low. Attend me now. These words are meant for you, for are you not all men born of the Empire?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I see you nod. Aye, listen then, and consider. To be a man born of the Empire is to be one little part of a greater thing, and to play that part, a man must know his place in the workings of the World.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The first duty of a man is to rejoice! For the Empire is a glory upon the earth! It is the light by which the outer dark may be driven back! Never before, since the birth of the Ages, has man wrought such a great and civilising estate upon the face of the World!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;To the common-born man, this is a thing he must know, even though he cannot see it. Even the blessed Emperor himself, from the highest battlement of his palace, yet even from the loftiest tower of Middenheim, cannot see the edges of his dominion all of a whole. It has been said that a man, even with a good mount, will ride for a full half-year of his lifetime if he wishes to cross the Empire from one margin to another. And how many men, of the base and common kind, never venture further than the limits of their village, or the boundaries of their parish? Such men know nothing of the greater thing, except that which they are told by travellers and scholars; such men never behold a building more splendid than their own burg&rsquo;s small guild hall, or a tower more massive than the spire of their poor village church.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Yet, as the thinkers of antiquity have taught us, just because we cannot see a thing, does not mean it is not there. We do not see the lamp of the sun at night, but we know it sleeps safe in its cavity beneath the earth. We do not see almighty Sigmar, yet we do not doubt that He watches over us always.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;So it is with the Empire. We are girt about by its vast domain, wherein are mountains and moors, forests and pastures, rivers and vales, and many towns and greater cites, peopled by the common crowd and the noble born both. But we never see it whole and all together.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;To imagine it in full, imagine this in its part. In fair Altdorf, in the gleaming halls of Grand Cathedral of Sigmar, there is a chamber of most wondrous beauty. The pillars of the walls are wrapped entire with gold leaf, and the great casements look out across the River Reik itself, a splendid vista. Upon the walls hang many an arras tapestry on which are threaded scenes of hunting and sport, of war and victory, of Lord Sigmar and the Unberogen. Marvellous to behold! But it is the floor which most arrests the eye.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Into this wide surface is inlaid, by means of handsome craft, a mosaic of lacquered wood and polished metals, forming in all detail a mappa mundi, a chart of this world that is the Empire. Few men have had the privilege of seeing this mappa mundi, but just because you cannot see a thing, does not mean it is not there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;I have seen it. I have seen it lit about with tapers. Such a thing it is...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The limits of the Great Chart are made of satin wood and silver thread, showing the icy bounds of our domain. Almost unbroken, a majestic circle of mountains surrounds the Empire, like the high brim of a vast chalice. Within that chalice bowl, the precious life-blood of the Empire and all its wealth is cupped.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Lime and rose wood segments interlock with burnished panels of green copper and ruddy brass to represent the extents of the eleven provinces, and rosettes of oak and maple, wound with gold wire, mark the places of the great city states. Each town or prosperous burg is a flat button of ivory. The web of rivers and their tributaries is chased out in bars of pearl and loops of spun steel. Lakes are slivers of looking-glass. The mighty forests of the realm, chevron darts of ebony, speckle the entire floor like the coat of a brindled mare.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Admire such craftsmanship! Here is Nordland, facing the sea. Here, if you look, Ostland, and Hochland too, dressed in forests, athwart the jumbled masses of the Middle Mountains. To the east there, Ostermark, guarding the line of the north against the cold encroach of Kislev, there rural Stirland and the Moot, the World&rsquo;s Edge Mountains climbing beyond them. To the south, Averland and Wissenland, contained to the east by the Black Mountains and to the west by the ancient forest tracts known as Loren. And there Talabecland, Middenland and Reikland.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Look closer now, at the proud cities: Nuln, pungent with black powder, the foundry of the Empire; Talabheim, the Eye of the Forest, its impenetrable wall protecting its pasture lands from the woods without; Middenheim, the city of the White Wolf, a craggy bastion raised above the world; and Altdorf, royal Altdorf, jewel of the Empire. And here too Wolfenburg, our own fair city, stalwart guardian of Ostland&rsquo;s reaches.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Marvel at it; rejoice! This Empire of man! Picture that fine chamber again, picture it as on a fair summer&rsquo;s evening, such as was the occasion when I witnessed it. Servants appear, dressed in fine livery. Flaming candles are brought out on golden sticks&mdash;one! two! a dozen! more!&mdash;and placed, each one particularly, upon the Great Chart to indicate the mighty cities and city-states. Then smaller tapers too, aflame also, carried in by more servants and set upon the mark of every noted town and burg. Such a sight! In the last rays of the sunlight falling in through the casements, the Great Chart is ablaze with a thousand points of light, a constellation that shapes out in scintillating glory the immensity of our domain!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Thus may a man rejoice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;But attend me now. If a man&rsquo;s first duty is to rejoice, his second is to beware. For all the golden splendour of the Empire, for all its worth and lore and monuments of stone, there stands against it great and perpetual jeopardy: enemies more numerous than all the trees of the forest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;They coil in the darkness; the ice-darkness beyond the rampart mountains, the shadow-darkness of the deep forests, the tomb-darkness of the pits beneath the earth. They lurk in ruins, in desert places, in the long grass of forsaken fields, in the creaking, green-black shade of forlorn woodlands. They scuttle in dry catacombs, they claw beneath the flint and granite of the lonely hills, they haunt the tumbledown ruins of villages long since abandoned by man. They even stalk our own dreams. And, as night comes, they keen with the whippoorwills and move against us; curious, greedy, wild, rapacious, hungry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The enemies are older than us, older even than the tribes we men of the Empire sprang from. Knowing only the clarion-cry of &ldquo;Murder All!&rdquo; they would set the world ablaze, make doom upon us, and carry off our heads on pikes!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;You quake and you tremble! Justly so! They would make battle trophies of us, cast down our walls, and burn our crops! Our womenfolk, our children, none may be spared the dreadful butchery!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;So we must watch for their first stirrings, and sharpen our blades. Place sentries on the walls. Close our gates at nightfall. Listen to the whisper of the wind and the sounds it may bring. Trust not the dark, or the scratching of rats, or even the neighbour whose ways seem alien. The enemy comes in all shapes and guises.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Some are beasts, some are wild, barbaric tribe-kin, some are vermin within our very walls. Most know nothing of our proud, fair gods, or if they do, know them only as bright things that they yearn to tear down and trample. They have spirits of their own, feral godlings and daemons which they worship with gleeful lust and to whom tributes are made in blood. In the name of Sigmar, we renounce all such misbegotten spirits!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;What enemies, you mutter. I work my craft and pay my tithe and sleep soundly, and I have not seen the like of them. Just so? Yes? Beware! Just because you cannot see them, doesn&rsquo;t mean they are not there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Consider their handiwork. There are bleak places in the Empire, out of the way of man, where certain ruins stand, open unto the elements. I have seen a few such edifices myself, and can attest to them. Time and weather have worn them plain, but it is still possible to discern that these ruins were not raised by human hands. They are the work of other kinds, other races that dwelt in these lands long before the rise of the Unberogen. We may suspect they are the relics of the fading races; the halfling men, the indomitable Dwarfs we sometimes welcome as allies, even, perhaps, the Slight Ones themselves, who linger in the ancient forest paths.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Whatever their makers&rsquo; identity, they are just ruins now. Cold and dead. But they tell of huge strength and formidable defence. Indomitable bastions, high towers, earthworks, siege walls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Yet none remain. For all their strength, they were overcome in the early times, and put to flame, and ransacked. Even they could not withstand the feral onslaught of the enemies in the dark. Even they could not withstand!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;But we must. This I say to you with the force of my heart. We must beware at all times, and be ready, peasant farmer and spurred knight alike, to fight, for Sigmar, for the Emperor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Empire has stood for twenty-five centuries. It has driven back the green-skin brutes from the mountains, the tribal hordes from the north, the incursions of the blasphemous Dark Gods themselves. If the Empire is to stand for another twenty-five centuries, it depends on each and every man born its son! You, and you, and you!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Rejoice, but beware! Rejoice, but beware! That is balance every man must keep in his mind. Picture the Empire again, the glorious chart, lit by a thousand candle flames. Its achievements are manifold, its power great. No feat of mankind is more worthy of protection and safeguard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;But now the evening light fades, and night closes in outside the casements. In the splendid chamber, shadows gather, deeper, darker, until we cannot see the map at all anymore. Only the taper flames burn, a thousand furious, fragile lights in the dark.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;How small they seem now, how far apart from each other! What tracts of darkness separate one flame light from another!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;And in that darkness, we cannot see. But just because we cannot see, doesn&rsquo;t mean there isn&rsquo;t something there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The night wind picks up outside the casements. Close them fast, before it is too late! The scattered flames flutter, frantic in the black. One by one, they sputter and die.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;How quickly they go out. How easily they are extinguished.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;How total the darkness that remains.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Go from this place. Praise Sigmar, and go about your lives. Peddler, provost, woodsman, soldier, barkeep, coachman, chandler, goodwife... go to your varied callings and prosper. But keep the holy days and the festivals, bar the door at night, whet your blade&rsquo;s edge, and, in the name of Sigmar, keep watch against the dark.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;How quickly the lights go out!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Here ends the lesson.</p>"}

During the closing stages of the War of the Beard, most Elves retreated from the Old World, but a few remained and withdrew to the depths of the magical forests they now called home. Over three thousand years of isolation, hardship, and warfare then ensued, leaving &lsquo;Wood Elves&rsquo; culturally very different to their High Elf cousins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wood Elf life is entwined with nature, with a society intermixed with spirits of the forest. They are separatists who work hard to hide themselves away, with arboreal outposts cunningly concealed with powerful illusions and misleading magics. On the rare occasions they travel beyond their borders, it is usually for war, as often with their neighbours as with darker forces, leaving other peoples of the Old World deeply unsure of the fae, capricious Elves.</p>\n<p>There are two kiths of Wood Elves most commonly seen in Reikland. The &lsquo;Asrai&rsquo; from Athel Loren across the Grey Mountains, and &lsquo;Eonir&rsquo; of the Laurelorn Forest far to the north in Nordland.</p>\n<p>The ruthless Asrai of Athel Loren are xenophobic and secretive, and rarely venture beyond their borders. However, a decade ago, Naith the Prophetess foresaw the possible death of Athel Loren. In response, the King and Queen of the Wood, recognising the fate of their forests may lay in the hands of outsiders, sent tattooed kinbands out from Athel Loren to take action, hunting the enemies of the forest at the source.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These ferocious bands are sometimes led by a spellsinger who calls upon the old, magical paths of the Worldroot to transport them between Athel Loren and the depths of other forests long lost to the Elves, but not yet consumed by civilisation or Chaos. Occasionally, these wild hunters perceive some common cause with other Old Worlders and an individual may step from the shadows to join with those fighting a greater evil.</p>\n<p>By comparison, the Queen of the Laurelorn takes a very different path to the foretellings given to her and has recently sent a sizeable delegation to make camp in the deep forest of the Amber Hills just south of Altdorf. These Elves observe Human politics concerning the Laurelorn and beyond, and occasionally intervene on matters deemed important. The camp is viewed as a &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; solution by the Elves, but the meaning of that word is very different to the long-lived species. Because of this camp, these Wood Elves are a growing presence in Reikland as they venture from the trees and wander according to their inscrutable purposes, often as hunters or entertainers.</p>\n<h3>Opinions</h3>\n<h4>On Reiklander Humans&hellip;</h4>\n<p>&lsquo;I see hateful creatures with darkness in their hearts and a complete disrespect for order. But they are widespread, warlike, and, most importantly, easy to manipulate.

Unlike the High Elves, neither of the Wood Elven kiths care much for any form of conventional civilisation, seeing it as a threat to their beloved forests and way of life. However, they differ in how they choose to express this.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>The Laurelorn Wood Elves proactively engage in politics to protect themselves, mixing with others, and are not above stoking the fires of hatred between other groups to shift focus to their preferred targets. Thus, in character, they are more like the High Elves, whilst still having the Skills and Talents of the Wood Elves.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>By comparison, the Athel Loren kinbands prefer to hide in the shadows, shunning contact with all others, instead striking deadly blows designed to cause fear and terror in the hearts of any who would look to the forest with greed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/hunter.webp","_id":"KmMpOZd0EaPItYpy"}

Spending time in Wheburg prior to marriage has become something of a rite-of-passage for well-heeled Reiklanders, and it&rsquo;s common to hear men and women calling out, &lsquo;what happens in Wheburg, stays in Wheburg!&rsquo; from many a street corner.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"}

The staff are:</p>\n<p>&bull; Wertha Trotz - Manager</p>\n<p>&bull; Faustmann the Killer - Pit Fighter</p>\n<p>&bull; Bruno - Barman and Wierdroot Dealer</p>\n<p>&bull; Gebhard - Barman</p>\n<p>&bull; Hans and Hans - Potboys</p>\n<p>&bull; Petal - Halfling Cook</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-style: italic;\">Bill of Fare at the Mermaid</h3>\n<ul style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n<li>Mug of Altdorfer Alt Ale &ndash; An amber beer with a strong taste of hops &ndash; 2d</li>\n<li>Mug of Dunkel Schwarzbier &ndash; A strong and dark lager &ndash; 4d</li>\n<li>Tankard of Gaslicht Zum Ale &ndash; Locally brewed nutty flavoured bitter &ndash; 3d</li>\n<li>Tankard of Scallop&rsquo;s Lobster Skrumpy &ndash; Very strong cider flavoured with fish wine &ndash; 5d</li>\n<li>Glass of Wine &ndash; Cheap white Reikish Hock from a barrel &ndash;&nbsp; 4d</li>\n<li>Spitchcocked Reikeels &ndash; Traditional Altdorf docker&rsquo;s fare &ndash; 6d</li>\n<li>Smoked Mackerel Pottage &ndash; A filling meal with cheap homemade bread &ndash; 1/-</li>\n<li>Pickled Fish and Fig Tart &ndash; A decent size pie suitable for two meals &ndash; 1/3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What has happened here?</h2>\n<p>Bruno had been supplying Hugo Shortshank with Wierdroot. In Altdorf at this time a dealer must be a paid-up member of the Apothecaries&rsquo; Guild in order to supply the drug, as the Watchmen will know on a successful <strong>Lore (Law)</strong> Skill Test.</p>\n<p>Bruno has a few friends in the bar who rely on him to supply their own habits, so this scene is a good opportunity for a fight.</p>\n<h2>Gossip in the bar</h2>\n<p>There is a hubbub of conversation going on in the Mermaid, and whilst some of it will die down when the Watch enter they may be able to spark up a bit of a conversation with customers on a <strong>Difficult (-10) Gossip</strong> Skill Test.</p>\n<p><em>&bull; Hieronymus Juniper keeps on coming in &lsquo;ere bothering our Petal &lsquo;e does, claims he&rsquo;s checking that she&rsquo;s being looked after properly, but I reckon &lsquo;e&rsquo;s just got a fancy for &lsquo;er is all.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; I seen some posters showing them ratmen on them I have, just put up freshly this morning, round the corner by the square.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; Trouble, ain&rsquo;t been trouble in &lsquo;ere for a while. Not since Wertha took the plunge and banned Tarwin Fleischer from the bar. A bad sort that one, now you can get a nice quiet drink in &lsquo;ere without fear of a brawl.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; I reckon this Runt Render&rsquo;s a Watchman meself. It&rsquo;s good business for them whenever one of these pattern killing sickos appears. Gives &lsquo;em a reason to get more funding, so&rsquo;s they can bother law abiders like me who just want a bit of peace and quiet and a few drinks now and then.</em></p>\n<h2>How to uncover Bruno</h2>\n<p>Werther, Faustmann, Bruno and Gebhard will all try to convince the Watch that no one at the Mermaid has done anything wrong and will try to cover for one another where possible - Bruno&rsquo;s side business is a nice little earner and brings in a good few extra customers. They will also moan that only last week a Watch patrol came into the tavern and broke up a brawl, causing more damage than the brawlers did. Hans and Hans know nothing but Petal will be more helpful. It was she who tipped the Watch off in the first place. However she is frightened of</p>\n<p>repercussions and will have to be reassured that she will be looked after if anything goes wrong.</p>\n<p>Anyone who can read<strong> Secret Signs (Thief) </strong>will notice that &ldquo;Bruno is the dream dealer&rdquo; is scratched on a chalk slate next to a darts board if they pass a Perception Skill Check.</p>\n<p>If the Watch conduct a search of the staff they will find half a dozen chunks of wierdroot on Bruno on a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Skill Test.</p>\n<p>Should they then try to arrest him Bruno will try to fight his way out. He will have Faustmann on his side and three customers will help him out too.</p>\n<p>Wertha and Gebhard will not try to help Bruno but they will try to defend the tavern from any damage. Gebhard will keep the fight covered with a Blunderbuss and scream regularly for people to calm down.</p>\n<p>Hans and Hans will run for cover whilst Petal hides in the kitchen. She may help out in a slapstick fashion, banging an opponent of the Watch on the head with her frying pan when he is looking the other way, or something.</p>\n<h2>Interrogating Bruno</h2>\n<p>Should the Watch ask Bruno if he has any information on Hugo have them make an <strong>Intimidate</strong> Skill Test, if it is passed Bruno will tell them that the last time he came in the halfling was in the company of a man with fair hair wearing a black leather waistcoat.</p>\n<p>Asked if he recalls anything more about the man Bruno will let them know he had a very irritating laugh and that he laid a sheaf of papers down on the bar when he was there (Draygo&rsquo;s pad of reporter&rsquo;s notes). He also notes that recently he has seen him again, he came into the bar again looking for some cheap smoking weed, and he carried an instrument, some sort of large wooden horn. This didn&rsquo;t strike Bruno as odd, as all sorts of entertainers are taking advantage of Altdorf&rsquo;s music week to earn a few extra shillings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

{"_id":"NOjdioCY5f3Dg9Bj","name":"Summary","permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"DMQs1UveUtlyzPKt","sort":900001,"flags":{},"content":"<p>In this scenario the PCs are a group of Watchmen sent out to patrol the notorious docklands of Altdorf. This adventure consists of a number of set scenes. Only @JournalEntry[jb3aJ8BLgyGHPLmG]{The Briefing} needs to be played out first, other scenes are then played out depending on the decisions of the patrol.</p>\n<p>Some scenes are optional, and are to be fitted in if the GM feels the party need a helping hand, or if a violent or investigative scene might improve the pace of the scenario.</p>\n<p>Hopefully by the end of the session the PCs will have amassed enough information to arrest Drago Vedris, a vicious serial killer of Halflings, as well as solving other crimes, keeping the peace in Altdorf and, perhaps, earning a few backhanders.</p>\n<p>The following is a recommended running order for the scenes of the scenario, GMs may find it easier to force the action along in this way, but we encourage you to allow players to decide what leads they wish to follow. If they make progress a little too quickly throw in a couple of petty crimes for them to deal with, such as witnessing a burglary or assault, in order to complicate matters.</p>\n<h2>BEFORE YOU BEGIN</h2>\n<p>Make sure that all the players have read their character information and that all the players have seen the copy of the Altdorf Speiler in the handouts section. The stories in the Speiler are common knowledge around Altdorf at the time of the scenario, so even if the player&rsquo;s characters can&rsquo;t read let them look at the newssheet.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[jb3aJ8BLgyGHPLmG]{The Briefing}</h2>\n<p>Captain Trenker fills the PCs in on the latest cases. From here the patrol could take on the following cases in any order they wish:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@JournalEntry[rJuorWdIjMar3Kdh]{The Case of the Goblin Sighting}</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[MqWOss5hlnG2YY8F]{The Case of the Weirdroot Ring}</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[ZbDsbmx9A22WB2ST]{The Case of the Beaten Bawd}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During these cases the PCs will uncover clues to the other cases; they can also come across the following cases whilst on their rounds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@JournalEntry[QMXMUKqElq4nKmT0]{The Case of the Agitator}</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[WjAqI9KPA8hXSLQk]{The Case of the Halfling Spokesperson}</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[ekuOD5t7AJvJvdvJ]{The Case of the Arrested Noble}</li>\n<li>@JournalEntry[5zopWtNNkCYdQ0ow]{The Case of the Upset Tileans}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these have no relevance to the bigger picture, whilst others give extra clues as to other crimes in the city. Hopefully by the end of the game the PCs will have amassed enough info to go about @JournalEntry[ldcldXAuCAVsJ0D3]{Confronting Drago}.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[rJuorWdIjMar3Kdh]{The Case of the Goblin Sighting}</h2>\n<p>The Hooks and the Fish are two of Altdorf&rsquo;s most violent dockside gangs. They are often out to try and discredit one another.</p>\n<p>Recently a member of the Hooks spotted a greenskin in one of the warehouses on the dockfront. This caused some uproar and word spread fast before the leadership of the Hooks decided to be responsible and inform the Watch about what was going on.</p>\n<p>The Fish had stolen the greenskin from a boat carrying supplies and specimens to the</p>\n<p>University of Altdorf. As soon as the Hook who discovered the greenskin ran off they hid it elsewhere, hoping to sow confusion amongst the Hooks, have them loose customers (who don&rsquo;t want to use a greenskin infested warehouse) and discredit them with the Watch.</p>\n<p>The PCs can investigate the warehouse and find clues to the whereabouts of the goblin. This will win them the thanks of the Hooks but the enmity of the Fish. Or they can fail to find anything and move on with the other cases, meaning that neither of the dockside gangs think any differently of them</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[QMXMUKqElq4nKmT0]{The Case of the Agitator}</h2>\n<p>At some stage in their investigations the Watchmen see a young man looking a bit suspicious next to some recently pasted up flyers about the existence of Ratmen. They can attempt to arrest him, leading to a chase, and take him to the station if they catch him. He speaks Tilean and can help them solve @JournalEntry[5zopWtNNkCYdQ0ow]{The Case of the Upset Tileans} (see below).</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[WjAqI9KPA8hXSLQk]{The Case of the Halfling Spokesperson}</h2>\n<p>Heironymous Juniper, a self styled representative of Altdorf&rsquo;s Halfling population, has been appearing regularly and demanding to know how the case is progressing. He sometimes brings along journalists and members of the cult of Verena with him.Trenker has accused him of wasting Watch time&nbsp;and, in turn, Juniper has accused the Watch of institutionalised prejudice against Halflings, and he has threatened to ask Priests of Altdorf&rsquo;s Temple of Verena to take a close look at the matter. He may appear at junctures where the watch party are not busy with a Verenan Investigator in tow, demanding to know what latest leads have been examined in the case of the Pattern Killer.</p>\n<p>He may also appear with a writer for the Altdorf Spieler, who will interview the party.</p>\n<p>Heiro is merely a nuisance character used to waste party time. Some may feel that his interest may conceal a guilty secret, but he has done nothing wrong.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[MqWOss5hlnG2YY8F]{The Case of the Weirdroot Ring}</h2>\n<p>The last victim of the Halfling Pattern Killer was a wierdroot addict, and Captain Trenker has suggested that the Mermaid tavern staff might have supplied the drug based on evidence given by witnesses who saw the victim regularly visit the tavern, but not drink there.</p>\n<p>One of the barmen at the Mermaid has been dealing wierdroot. He will not go without a fight though. He may be able to give them some info about the wierdroot habits of his former customers if beaten into submission.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[5zopWtNNkCYdQ0ow]{The Case of the Upset Tileans}</h2>\n<p>These Tileans are the crew of a vessel who have had a Hobgoblin specimen stolen. They have come to the Watch station to complain, but no one there speaks fluent Tilean. Until the party turn up with someone who can speak Tilean they will hang about trying to communicate in mime or just jabbering amongst themselves.</p>\n<p>They saw distinctly that a man hung about their boat prior to the theft. They can give a description of him. He wore a symbol of a fish stitched to his jerkin.</p>\n<p>They used to have a halfling Burgher/Scribe/ Navigator with them who was their interpreter, but he hasn&rsquo;t been seen since this morning.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[ZbDsbmx9A22WB2ST]{The Case of the Beaten Bawd}</h2>\n<p>Tristran Mahler, a local Bawd with a violent reputation, stumbles into the station covered in blood.</p>\n<p>It seems he has had some merchandise stolen from his warehouse, though he isn&rsquo;t keen to explain where he received his injuries.</p>\n<h2>@JournalEntry[ekuOD5t7AJvJvdvJ]{The Case of the Arrested Noble}</h2>\n<p>In the cells is a noble who has been arrested for assaulting a working girl. He plays no part in the adventure really but is an excuse for some important NPCs to be unavailable in the adventure. If the PCs return to the station they find that many of their superiors are busy trying to, at first, threaten the noble, then, having realised how important he is, attempting to appease him. Later they will be in an office with him and a member of the local Verenan clergy to discuss proper restitution.</p>\n<h2>THE PATTERN KILLER</h2>\n<p>The big story in Altdorf at the moment is that of the Pattern Killer, a man who has slain three halflings whose bodies have been discovered every second Aubentag for the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>The Watch are desperate to catch him, if only to get Hieronymus Juniper off their backs.</p>\n<p>Drago Vedris is the killer. He has abducted a halfling from a Tilean barge and holds it in a bedsit he has hired near the docks, planning his latest fiendish ironic death for the runts he so irrationally despises.</p>\n<p>The party are up against it to gather all the clues they can in order to rescue the victim and bring Drago to justice before the scenario is finished.</p>"}

Specialising in his Ground Pork and Fig Pies, which he proudly proclaims contain absolutely no rat at all, Roscoe is a popular figure on the quayside, selling to boatman, Fish and Hook alike.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Hans Zweifel is selling fried slices of parsnip flavoured with exotic spice from the sun drenched Islas of Estalia!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Mermaid&rsquo;s a sound tavern.

Schl&auml;ger is a brute of a man who grew up in Altdorf&rsquo;s notorious Drecksack Slums, where he learnt the fine arts of gutter fighting and bare knuckle boxing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Verkn&uuml;pfung is a sound trader.

Schygulla used to run with the Hooks and also has strong links to the Luitpoldstrasse Watch, making him in his own way one of the most powerful men in the Niederhafen Bezirk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Typical trick this.

While this is not one of the most populist movements in Altdorf, one of the main planks of her argument is telling bawdy tales that expose the hypocrisy of Magisters on this matter, which always gathers a fair crowd.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;It is so unfair I tell you! If Magister G&uuml;nter Hunold can attend the parties of Michaela von J&auml;nke and engage in unrestrained debauchery, then why cannot my Magnus spend a night with me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Luther Huss is in Altdorf and is to preach upon the subject of Valten&rsquo;s Heroism at the Mallusschmied Palais tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Johan Kyttlie &ndash; Weather Scryer</h3>\n<p>Johan makes his living selling weather forecasts to ship&rsquo;s captains and anyone else who wants one. To do this he employs many traditional Reikland techniques, almost all of which require string, dried fish and a limited ability to call on the Winds of Magic. If questioned, he will stress at length that he is not in fact a Hedge Wizard, and that all of his divination methods are done with science, not magic at all. In common with other Altdorf Weather Scryers, Johan wears tattered robes covered with divination trinkets and carries a copper shod staff with seabird feathers pinned to it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Something is not right, the weather has been wrong for the last two weeks and that incident with the burning barge just made it worse.

The injury rules show you how to deal with them and how to heal them, when possible.</p>\n<h3><strong>Wounds, Critical Wounds, and Death</strong></h3>\n<p>Wound loss represents minor cuts and abrasions, bruises and bashes, and even the depletion of spiritual and mental energy reserves. By comparison, Critical Wounds are much more severe, expressing serious injuries, broken bones, torn muscles, and ripped flesh. Gain too many Critical Wounds, and you risk death.</p>\n<h4><strong>Wounds</strong></h4>\n<p>Wounds are lost by sustaining Damage. Each time you suffer a point of Damage, you lose 1 Wound. So, if you suffer 8 points of Damage, you lose 8 Wounds. Often, especially in combat, your Toughness Bonus or Armour Points may reduce suffered Damage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, if you were hit in the arm for 10 Damage and your Toughness Bonus was 3, and you had leather armour on that arm for 1 Armour Point, you would suffer 6 Wounds (10–3–1=6). The rules will tell you when you can or cannot reduce Damage with Toughness and Armour Points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you lose all of your Wounds, your collected injuries overwhelm you, and you gain the Prone Condition. Until you heal at least 1 Wound, you cannot lose the Prone Condition; worse, if you’re not healed within a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus, you will pass out, gaining the Unconscious Condition. You will not regain consciousness until you heal back at least 1 Wound (see @JournalEntry[Healing]).</p>\n<p>If you take enough Damage that you would be taken to negative Wounds — say you suffered 5 Damage when you only had 2 Wounds left — you suffer a Critical Wound. If you suffer fewer negative Wounds than your Toughness Bonus (so, fewer than –4 Wounds if your Toughness Bonus is 4), you subtract –20 from your Critical Table result, with a minimum result of 01 (see page 174). Note: You never actually go into negative Wounds. The lowest number of Wounds you can ever have is 0.</p>\n<h4><strong>Critical Wounds</strong></h4>\n<p>Critical Wounds are most commonly suffered in combat when something really wants to hurt you. The two most frequent sources of Critical Wounds are when a Critical Hit is scored, or when you lose more Wounds than you have (see @JournalEntry[Combat] for more on how Critical Hits happens).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each Critical Wound you receive will impact your ability to function in a different way. To determine what effects a Critical Wound has, refer to the Critical Tables (see page 174).</p>\n<h4><strong>Death</strong></h4>\n<p>If you take the @Condition[Unconscious] Condition and have 0 Wounds, compare the total number of Critical Wounds you currently suffer with your Toughness Bonus. If you have more Critical Wounds than your Toughness Bonus, you succumb to your horrific wounds and will die at the end of the round unless, by some miracle, someone heals one of your Critical Wounds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, if you have the Unconscious Condition, anyone attacking you with suitable weapons can kill you, should they wish.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Though, in the thick of combat, those lying apparently dead on the floor are almost always ignored in favour of combatants still standing.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a few results sourced from the Critical Tables can result in death. Should any of these occur, it is time to permanently spend a @JournalEntry[Fate and Resilience]{Fate point} if you have one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Pulling Your Blows</h3>\n<p>The rules assume you wish to inflict every possible Critical Wound you can. However, it’s also possible you may just want to subdue, not kill, your opponents. Or you may be sparring. With that in mind, you may ignore any Critical Hit you should inflict upon your opponents if you declare you are ‘pulling your blow’ before you roll to hit. If you do this, make sure you describe the situation appropriately, making it clear you’re using the flat of your blade or otherwise doing what you can to avoid properly hurting your opponent.</p>\n<h3>Options: Sudden Death</h3>\n<p>Rather than worrying about Critical Wounds and protracted deaths, you may simply wish to know if someone is dead or not. The GM can do this by using the Sudden Death rules, which significantly accelerates play. When your targets suffer more damage than they have Wounds, they simply die in a suitably dramatic fashion or immediately gain the Unconscious Condition. Your choice.</p>\n<p>Sudden Death is especially useful for quickly dealing with minor foes such as Brigands, Cultists, or Wild Animals, although it should not be used for PCs or important NPCs.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Old Worlders do their best to stay on the right side of their gods.</p>\n<p>High-ranking clerics are wealthy and powerful, wielding as much influence and prestige as the greatest nobles. At the other end of the scale, village priests tend to the spiritual needs of rural communities, preaching the tenets of their faith and interceding with their patron deities on behalf of their flocks. Several faiths also support templar orders: these private armies of priest-soldiers answer to the head of their faith rather than to any noble or elector count, which can cause significant political friction.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Gods</strong></h2>\n<p>The people of the Old World recognise many deities. Some are worshipped across the whole of the Old World; some are restricted to one nation or region; and some are patrons of just a single town or occupation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Gods Of The Empire</strong></h3>\n<p>In the Empire, the pantheon of gods is split into three broad categories: the Old Gods, the Classical Gods, and the Provincial Gods. Standing apart from these is Sigmar, the first Emperor, and patron deity of the Empire as a whole.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Old Gods</strong></h4>\n<p>The Old Gods refer to the pantheon of deities worshipped when the Empire was unbroken forest populated by wandering tribes of barbarians. Many Old Gods stood as patrons to one of the tribes, and to this day some are still associated with the old geographical hunting grounds of those ancient peoples. Although few say so out loud, many citizens of the Empire regard the Old Gods as the true deities of the Empire, and the Classical Gods as relative newcomers.</p>\n<p>As time passed, five gods rose to prominence amongst the Old Gods, worshipped by dominant cults spread from one end of the Empire to the other: Ulric, Taal, Rhya, Manaan, and Morr, representing the primal spheres of war, nature, fertility, seas, and death.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Classical Gods</strong></h4>\n<p>The Classical Gods spread from the southern lands of Tilea, Estalia, and the Border Princes through trade and diplomatic contact. Today, their worship is popular in the cosmopolitan towns and cities, and some nobles and townsfolk secretly regard them as more sophisticated than the Old Gods — though few would risk voicing such opinions aloud!</p>\n<p>The most widespread cults of Classical Gods in the Empire are dedicated to Verena, Myrmidia, Shallya, and Ranald, patrons of wisdom, strategy, mercy, and trickery. Hiding behind these, there is also Khaine, the God of Murder, though his cult is outlawed in most places.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Provincial Gods</strong></h4>\n<p>The Empire hosts a wide variety of deities — patrons of provinces, towns, forests, lakes, rivers, crafts, and much more besides. Formed into complicated pantheons by local legends and myths, the Provincial Gods often have small cults dedicated to them, but few have much influence. However, there are exceptions: standing high above other Provincial Gods, worship of Handrich, the God of Trade, has spread significantly with commerce and now boasts a significant cult-presence amongst the Empire’s rising merchant class.</p>\n<h4><strong>Sigmar</strong></h4>\n<p>Sigmar founded the Empire over two-thousand years ago, and his legend recounts how he conquered unthinkable foes and overcame impossible odds. Reigning for fifty years, he eventually abdicated and turned east to return his magical warhammer, Ghal-Maraz, to its forgers: his old allies, the Dwarfs. He was never seen again. Not long after, oracles and prophets claimed Sigmar had ascended to godhood, invested by Ulric before the entire pantheon of old gods and new.</p>\n<p>Today, many centuries later, the cult of Sigmar, patron of the Empire, has spread to such an extent that its leader, the Grand Theogonist, is arguably more powerful than the emperor himself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Gods of the Reikland</strong></em></p>\n<table style=\"height: 115px; width: 573px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 34px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 74px; height: 34px;\"><em>Bögenauer</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 63px; height: 34px;\"><em>River Bögen</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 91px; height: 34px;\"><em>Boatmen, Merchants, and Bögenhafeners</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 130px; height: 34px;\"><em>Coins, sheaves of reeds, rolled stones</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 199px; height: 34px;\"><em>A single temple in Bögenhafen with no full-time clerics; shrines line the river.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 74px; height: 17px;\"><em>Borchbach</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 63px; height: 17px;\"><em>Rhetoric</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 91px; height: 17px;\"><em>Agitators, politicians, lawyers</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 130px; height: 17px;\"><em>Written speeches, acorns, quills</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 199px; height: 17px;\"><em>Several shrines and two temples to Borchbach are found in Altdorf.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 13px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 74px; height: 13px;\"><em>Clio</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 63px; height: 13px;\"><em>History</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 91px; height: 13px;\"><em>Scholars</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 130px; height: 13px;\"><em>Fruit, honey, menses</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 199px; height: 13px;\"><em>A significant temple to the Classical God Clio is attached to Altdorf University.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 74px; height: 17px;\"><em>Dyrath</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 63px; height: 17px;\"><em>Women</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 91px; height: 17px;\"><em>Womenfolk</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 130px; height: 17px;\"><em>Beer, eels, silver</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 199px; height: 17px;\"><em>Dyrath has no temples; instead, a secretive cult is spread through the villages and hamlets of the Hägercrybs.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 74px; height: 17px;\"><em>Grandfather Reik</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 63px; height: 17px;\"><em>River Reik</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 91px; height: 17px;\"><em>Merchants, bargees, fishermen</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 130px; height: 17px;\"><em>Coins, jewellery, clothing</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 199px; height: 17px;\"><em>Shrines dot the length of the river Reik, but there is no formal cult.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 74px; height: 17px;\"><em>Katya</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 63px; height: 17px;\"><em>Disarming Beauty</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 91px; height: 17px;\"><em>Bawds, lovers, the lonely</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 130px; height: 17px;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 199px; height: 17px;\"><em>Temples to Katya double as brothels in the towns of the Vorbergland.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Other Pantheons</strong></h3>\n<p>The different countries and species of the Old World all have deities of their own. Some, according to theologians, are aspects of other deities worshipped under different names. Others are&nbsp;particularly revered by a particular species: examples include Grungni, the Dwarfen God of Mining and Dwarf Pride; Isha, a Goddess of Fertility and Nature who is seen as the mother of all Elves; and Esmerelda, the Halfling Goddess of Hearth, Home, and Family.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Chaos Gods</strong></h3>\n<p>The Daemonic gods of the Realms of Chaos are the greatest threat to the Old World, each determined to bring absolute ruin to the mortal realm. Their worship by lost and damned souls is pervasive and clandestine, with uncounted dark cultists infiltrating all levels of society. Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and Slaanesh: Gods of Rage, Despair, Ambition, and Excess. Few dare whisper their twisting names, for they harbour malevolent power, and leave mutation and horror in their wake.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Cults</strong></h2>\n<h4><strong>Orders</strong></h4>\n<p>Most Old World cults are split into orders, with each order focussing on different aspects of their god’s concerns. Orders come in many different forms, including monastic orders of monks or nuns, templar orders of knights, priestly orders that attend to holy needs in the community, and mendicant orders of friars that wander the Old World, usually subsisting from alms. Each order is organised differently according to individual cult law and tradition, but in all cases they swear allegiance to the head of their cult, not the local nobility.</p>\n<h4><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h4>\n<p>The cults maintain holy sites across the Old World, many of them associated with legendary deeds of the gods from mythical times. Most are protected by buildings such as temples, abbeys, chapterhouses, or monasteries. Some older sites, or those not so well known, may only be marked by a shrine or unattended chapel. Cult buildings are usually decorated beautifully inside and out with scenes from the religion’s mythology. They vary widely in size and layout and often follow regional styles of architecture. Some hold extreme wealth, especially in the towns and cities where a more affluent population provides greater tithes. Larger cult buildings support dozens of people, including lay craftspeople, guards, and servants, while smaller sites are run by a handful of staff aided by volunteers from the community. In villages, a single priest is the norm, supported by the faithful.</p>\n<p>Shrines and chapels are more modest affairs, the size of a one-room house or smaller. They do not normally have a full-time priest, although they may come under the charge of a nearby temple or — especially in rural areas — a wandering priest who travels from one village and shrine to another. In a priest’s absence, local villagers pray unsupervised, leave small offerings, and keep the shrine in good repair.</p>\n<h3><strong>Primary Cults of the Empire</strong></h3>\n<p>Although many hundreds of gods are worshipped across the Empire, ten are of particular importance, each worshipped by cults spanning the grand provinces and granted a special position by Magnus the Pious over two-hundred years ago.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Grand Conclave</strong></h3>\n<p>When Emperor Magnus the Pious rebuilt the Empire after the Great War Against Chaos, he realised previous schisms and civil wars besetting his realm were often sourced in religious unrest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To help prevent this happening again, Magnus created the Grand Conclave, a meeting of the primary cults in the Empire held every five years to air grievances and discuss resolutions, with the emperor sitting as chair.</p>\n<p>Though enormously controversial at the time, the Grand Conclave is now fully accepted, and is held alongside great celebrations and festivities, with the representatives of the following gods required to attend: Manaan, Morr, Myrmidia, Ranald, Rhya, Shallya, Sigmar, Taal, Ulric, and Verena. Although other influential cults exist — such as the Cult of Handrich, which is currently lobbying for a seat on the Conclave — the ten currently sitting are widely perceived as the most important in the Empire.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Cult of Manann, God of the Sea]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Cult of Morr, God of Death]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Cult of Myrmidia, Goddes of Strategy]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Cult of Ranald, God of Trickery]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Cult of Rhya, Goddess of Fertility]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Cult of Shallya, Goddess of Mercy]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Cult of Sigmar, God of the Empire]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Cult of Taal, God of the Wild]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Cult of Ulric, God of War]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Cult of Verena, Goddess of Wisdom]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dwarven Ancestor Gods</h2>\n<p>The Dwarfs venerate their ancient ancestors, valuing tradition above all else. Though the Time of the Ancestor Gods was many thousands of years ago, the Dwarfs still hold records of that time in their oldest Holds. Many names echo from that era, creating a broad, inter-related pantheon, but three Ancestor Gods are of especial importance and are known by all Dwarfs: Grimnir, Grungni, and Valaya, each a progenitor of the species as a whole. In addition to the oldest Ancestor Gods, Dwarfs also revere the founders of local clans as guardian deities.</p>\n<h3>Dwarf Priests</h3>\n<p>Those dedicating themselves to the cults of the Ancestor Gods do not use the Priest, Nun, or Warrior Priest Careers, as Dwarfs have a very different relationship with their gods, seeking to emulate them rather than worship or appease them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because of this, if you wish to play a Dwarf dedicated to one of the Ancestor Gods, simply choose an appropriate career to best act like that god. So, if you wanted to emulate Grimnir, effectively becoming a priest of Grimnir, perhaps play a Slayer and join the Cult of the Slayer, or maybe become a Soldier.</p>\n<h2>Elven Gods</h2>\n<p>The Elves worshipped their own gods long before Humans and most other species existed in their current forms. Their pantheon is extensive, with different groups of deities being held as important by Wood Elves and High Elves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Loosely, there are two groups of gods, the Cadai and the Cytharai. The Cadai rule the heavens, and have strong connections to their Elven worshippers, directly helping where they can. The selfish Cytharai rule the underworld, and care little for the Elves. Standing apart from both these courts are a loose group of unaligned gods, the most prominent being Morai-Heg the Crone, Goddess of Fate and Death.</p>\n<p>The High Elves especially revere the Cadai, and have sophisticated priesthoods dedicated to their teachings. They appease the Cytharai when necessary, but it is unlawful to worship any but Mathlann, whose aid is sought by mariners. According to their myths, Asuryan, the God of Creation, is king of all the gods, able to pronounce judgement upon them all.</p>\n<p>The Wood Elves take a much more balanced approach and have temples and shrines to all the gods impacting their lives, be they Cadai or Cytharai. Because of their close association with the woods and forests, they revere Isha the Mother and Kurnous the Hunter above all others, and rumours persist that both gods take a direct hand in Wood Elf affairs.</p>\n<p>According to some theologians — mostly Elven — the deities of this pantheon are the true gods, and those worshipped by other species are simply different aspects of the Elven originals.</p>\n<h3>Elven Priests</h3>\n<p>Both High Elves and Wood Elves have priesthoods for the gods, but they do not have blessings and miracles. The Elves don’t believe the gods manifest in this fashion, and instead see magic as a gift from the gods. Because of this, if you wish to be an Elven priest, use the Wizard career, and chose from an appropriate Lore to represent the magic your god has gifted. So, a ‘priest’ of Kurnous would use the Lore of Beasts, a worshipper of Isha, the Lore of Life, and devotees of Asuryan use the Lores of Light or Fire.</p>\n<h2>Halfling Gods</h2>\n<p>Some say that Halflings are superstitious rather than religious, and the bulk of their deities support this impression. Most Halfling gods and goddesses have to do with hearth and home, cooking, herb lore, earthy matters, and general day-to-day concerns. Halfling gods are practical rather than philosophical: as the saying goes: ‘Deep thoughts butter no parsnips’. Halflings also show respect to certain Human deities — Sigmar, Taal, and Rhya in particular — but this is more from a desire to avoid conflict than from any sincere devotion.</p>\n<h3>Halfling Priests</h3>\n<p>Halflings don’t really have priests, and they certainly don’t build temples (though Humans seem happy to do it for them, especially Sigmarites). There are better things to do than warble on about someone else’s business. Of course, they respect the gods, and have shrines on-hand should they need to have a quick natter, but none make a career exclusively talking to just one god — why make yourself so exclusive? Should a particular god need to be appeased, it is usually left up to a local elder to do what’s required on behalf of the community, often after a great deal of talking with relevant experts and peers.</p>\n<h2>Chaos Gods</h2>\n<p>The Ruinous Powers of Chaos are the foremost existential threat to the Old World, but much about them remains a mystery. Merely seeking such knowledge is punishable by death without permission from the Cult of Sigmar. And seeking such permission attracts intense scrutiny of your person and motives, and is seldom granted.</p>\n<p>The Ruinous Powers are seen by the common folk as the punishing manifestation of sin, and the reason that all must behave within socially acceptable boundaries as espoused by the cults. Indulging in violence, lust, slovenliness or unseemly curiosity has direct repercussions for the individual (as they are corrupted and come to a sticky end) and for their community, as their deviant behaviour attracts the destructive attention of these evil forces.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The average person will know of the most powerful of these forces through euphemistic names, such as the Blood God, the Plague Lord, the Lord of Change, and the Prince of Pain. Even the most learned scholars of this forbidden lore can only guess at what motivates these obscene powers, or if they even have an agenda beyond their primal impulses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It seems there are competing factions dedicated to different aspects of ruin, and they are as much enemies to each other as to the rest of the Old World. On the rare occasions when they co-operate, much like they did during the Great War Against Chaos over two-hundred years ago, the world trembles. Some claim cults dedicated to the Chaos Gods have infiltrated the Empire. Most dismiss this as nonsense, for no right-thinking individual would be so foolish as to worship one of the Ruinous Powers.</p>"}

Although the University of Nuln is technically an older building, a tradition of sharing knowledge and keeping records is said to have been practiced in Sigmar&rsquo;s Reikdorf. Today, the walled university complex is one of the Empire&rsquo;s famous wonders. Five gates provide access to a sprawling maze of lecture halls, dormitories, and office buildings. A confusing array of staircases connect the multi-tiered open quads where students hurry between classes. Visitors without guides are bound to become disoriented.</p>\n<p>The university&rsquo;s five most prestigious colleges are those of law, medicine, military history, alchemy, and bestiara. Nuln is generally considered to have superior faculties of mathematics, science, philosophy, theology, and literature; however, Altdorf is somewhat less exclusive, making it more accessible to middleclass students. The diversity of the student body encourages vibrant intellectual discourse, and the nearby Street of a Hundred Taverns is abuzz with academic debate. Minor gods and their esoteric cults also find favour with the students; agitators compete for attention at the adjunct temple of Borchbach and the columned hall of the University&rsquo;s sanctuary to the classical god Clio houses archaeological finds discovered in and around Altdorf.</p>\n<p>A meister represents the professors of each college, and reports to the chancellor and vice-chancellor. Meisters are concerned with securing as much financing for their faculty as possible from the chancellor&rsquo;s office. The Komission of Procuration handles admission, funding, and discipline. The university employs its own watchmen (called &lsquo;porters&rsquo;) and enforces night curfews with a variable degree of success. The gates are closed during curfew hours, but adventurous students have found that sections of the wall are easy to climb down from within (although getting back inside can be difficult).</p>\n<h3>The Lodge of the League of Karl-Franz</h3>\n<p>The university&rsquo;s oldest lodge receives funding from aristocratic alumni. Its lodge is a turreted, stone building ornamented with wolf and griffon statuary. The League of Karl-Franz is infamous for the debauched behaviour of its membership,</p>\n<p>who revel in both this reputation and their apparent immunity to consequences for it. By long tradition, the revered bust of Ulric in the front hall is turned towards the wall between dusk and dawn so that he doesn&rsquo;t have to witness League members disgrace themselves. Membership is restricted to noble students, few of whom would be tolerated if not for their family titles.</p>\n<h3>Ulli von Tasseninck School of Religious Studies</h3>\n<p>The university&rsquo;s theological college operates with funding from the Knights of Everlasting Light and the noble von Tasseninck family. In front of the modern, brick building is a statue of Ulli von Tasseninck, an Ostland nobleman who was executed without trial during the 2506 Waterfront War. A vandal removed the statue&rsquo;s head some time ago, and pranksters often substitute it with a pumpkin. The student body includes initiates and lay scholars of both noble and common parentage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Map</h3>\n<p>@Scene[4hXNIoTga5SlXpER]{Altdorf University}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>NPCs</h3>\n<p>@Actor[GxtHDkmCefBgxN74]{Chancellor Eberhardt von Festschrift}</p>\n<p>@Actor[tc4WITZkNwFsHUYG]{Professor Quintus Fassbinder}</p>\n<p>@Actor[X63X3ysiHiqyYkuq]{Professor Frederich &lsquo;Old&rsquo; Weirde}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@Actor[GjSHESknElpcsOlJ]{Gerhardt von Jungfreud}</p>\n<p>@Actor[HocaZJvFpAgLwcUR]{Michaela von Janke}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Tables</h3>\n<p>@RollTable[9oygZV4n0WQuuX13]{University Watchmen}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Finding Fassbinder</h3>\n<p>Once the PCs arrive at the University, they can follow the signs to the administrative offices. As with most bureaucracies, there are more people seeking assistance than there are clerks on duty helping them. After waiting for quite a while, the PCs are able to obtain directions to Fassbinder&rsquo;s office. Likewise, general inquiries at the University will also lead them to Fassbinder, although they are likely to be directed to a handful of other Professors first, spending probably half a day identifying the right man to ask. If they ask about the Doktor&rsquo;s hours, the clerk lets out a snort and replies that Doktor Fassbinder tends to keep rather unusual hours, so it&rsquo;s hard to tell if he is in or not.</p>\n<p>Following the directions, the PCs come to a closed door at the end of a dimly lit hall in the basement of the College of Imperial History.</p>"}

He is the husband to Rhya, and father to Manaan, and is perceived by Taalites to be the king of the gods, though other cults dispute this. All nature is under his purview, from the snaking rivers to the tallest mountains, from the smallest insect to the greatest beast. He is normally portrayed as a powerfully built, virile man with long, wild hair and great spreading antlers, and is known for his volatile moods and his need to hunt.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Rural folk across the Old World venerate Taal, and any who make their living in wild places take care not to offend him. Taal is the patron deity of Talabecland in the Empire, where his cult holds significant sway, influencing all levels of society.</p>\n<p>Taal’s cult has a variety of smaller orders dedicated to holy sites and groves throughout the Old World, but two orders drive the cult forwards. The Order of the Antler are the priests of the cult, who are tasked to teach Taal’s ways and protect the wild places from intrusion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These Taalites are particularly widespread in Talabecland, and their forest temples are hubs of activity for rural folk. The Longshanks are a mix of warrior-priest and templar who typically wander as individuals, cleansing Taal’s wild places of corruption and ensuring rural communities do nothing to upset Father Taal.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Normally, temples to Taal are small, rustic affairs, built of wood and rough stone in a manner unchanged for countless centuries. They are usually sited close to natural features of wonder such as waterfalls, swirling pools, and mountains, and often have small sweat lodges attached. The high temple of Taal in Talabheim is something of an anomaly when compared to this. It appears more a well-maintained, albeit wild, noble garden than a temple, and huge services are held there under the spreading rowan trees weekly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Officially, the Hierarch leads the cult from there, though he spends most of his time in the wild groves of the nearby Taalgrunhaar Forest. Shrines to Taal are barely structures at all. Some old trees are regarded as sacred, and offerings pile up at their bases. Caves, forest groves, and other natural places are also used as shrines, and usually only a local or a devout follower of Taal can find them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Taal’s penances usually involve clearing diseased or mutated monsters from wild areas, replanting sacred trees, and maintaining groves important to the cult. A cultist might also be ordered to climb a high mountain and leave a stone on a cairn at the top, or clear an obstruction at the top of a waterfall. Whatever the specific task that must be undertaken, Taal’s penances almost always challenge the cultist to survive in the wild.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><em>Strictures</em></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Offer a prayer of thanks for every animal taken.</em></li>\n<li><em>Spend a week alone communing with the wilderness every year.</em></li>\n<li><em>Eschew metal armour; clad yourself in the hides of Taal.</em></li>\n<li><em>Rely on your own skill, not the advances of gunpowder or cold technology.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never harm an animal except in self-defence or for food or sacrifice.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.TKHvOsihelBStO6i]{Blessing of Breath}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Blessing of Hardiness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.eBRjKAF6U0yR0KK8]{Blessing of Savagery}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.By5dc8Q7ZAGpr177]{Blessing of The Hunt}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.SZ88OXYo6F2q3vWb]{Animal Instincts}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.n8MfaJhczROmscCR]{King of the Wild}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.mXKrxO8WRZ9QLHA6]{Leaping Stag}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.JxmIQjVuoPcQnyPF]{Lord of the Hunt}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ONz21FviMRk3AyvE]{Tanglefoot}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.PcKMAEF6UoaPSK6d]{Tooth and Claw}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/taal.webp"}

Carriages deliver nobles and merchants to the busy commodities exchange daily.</p>\n<p>The district&rsquo;s restaurants and taverns range in quality from peasant slop-houses to fine banqueting halls. Several restaurants that cater to merchants hold regular competitions. The customer who recorded the highest daily profit usually eats for free. These restaurants are members of a culinary society called the Grandmarkt Gourmand Club. The Halfling chefs of Haffenstadt are rumoured to have secret deals with Gourmand Club restaurants.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Handelshafen</li>\n<li>Altdorf Commodities Exchange</li>\n<li>The Grandmarket</li>\n<li>Palmerio's Emporium</li>\n<li>Herr Hohenzoll, Wool Merchant</li>\n<li>Riechenfeld-Kuypers Exotic Imports</li>\n<li>Talabec Bastion</li>\n<li>Salzenmund Export Company</li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Salzenmund Export Company - front for @Actor[xZZazeJDaUjqvNGI]{Nastassia Hess}</p>\n</section>"}

Indeed, so massive is the river that almost half the fresh water of the Old World ﬂows down its length, for it not only drains all the Reikland with its many tributaries, but most of the Empire beyond. By the time the Reik ﬂows into the Reikland, it is already so wide it frequently appears more lake than river, leaving it impossible to bridge using standard engineering methods. As this immense watercourse approaches @JournalEntry[Altdorf] to meet the dark waters of the Talabec, both rivers split into a complex network of channels that spread outwards to form the foggy @JournalEntry[Altdorf Flats]. Many of the thinner distributaries caused by this are bridgeable, ensuring Altdorf is a natural center for trade as it is the only place where the Reik can be crossed on foot for many hundreds of miles. This single fact has secured Altdorf&rsquo;s dominance of the area, both militarily and fiscally.</p>\n<p>Beyond the Altdorf Flats, the boggy channels reconverge and the Reik begins its long journey westwards to the sea. By this point, it is so wide the opposite bank sometimes slips into mist, and is so deep that even the largest sea-faring vessel can navigate without fear. Resultingly, warships of the Imperial Navy, some so large to have crews out-numbering the populations of smaller towns, not only patrol these waters, but are built there, most launching from the Reiksport, a deep-water harbour built on the shores of @JournalEntry[Altdorf] . Rocky islands are common in this last stretch, most of which are secured with ancient fortresses, overridden by river pirates, or abandoned completely, boasting nothing more than a handful of old smugglers&rsquo; coves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Powerful and dangerous folks tend to take it very, very poorly if someone refuses a Favour owed them, so bloody consequences may follow.</p>\n<p>The powerful often find it is far more useful to have various individuals owing them Favours than merely soliciting money in return for their help. What’s more, it can be an investment: help a student today, call in a favour from a successful Lawyer years later.

She is generally depicted as a tall, classically beautiful woman, and usually carries a sword and a set of scales. As the patron of justice she is concerned with fairness rather than the letter of the law: she opposes tyranny and oppression as much as crime.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Verena is worshipped throughout the Old World, especially in the south. Her devout followers include scholars, lawyers, and magistrates, as well as some wizards of the Colleges of Magic, particularly of the Grey and Light orders.</p>\n<p>The cult of Verena has no rigid hierarchy: it is said that Verena alone heads the cult, and no mortal intermediary is needed because truth is self-evident and requires no interpretation. Temple priests from the Order of Lorekeepers are tasked to preserve knowledge and communicate it to the community. They keep up a voluminous correspondence with each other, exchanging information and news.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Priests from the equally influential Order of Scalebearers are much sought after to act as judges, arbitrators, and go-betweens, because of their famed impartiality and mastery of the law. The Order of Mysteries is much smaller and less well-known, and contains warrior-priests who seek lost and forgotten lore, wherever it may lie. The last major order is the Knights of the Everlasting Light, templars famed for their sword skills, sense of fairness, and legendary bad luck. Verena’s cultists usually wear plain white robes, symbolic of pure truth and impartiality.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Temples to Verena can be found in most cities and larger towns, generally situated in the administrative or university quarters. Most libraries and court-houses include a shrine to the goddess, and smaller shrines can be found in the homes of many scholars and lawyers. Temples usually have colonnaded facades, with symbols of the goddess and allegorical figures of learning presented in low relief. Inside is a large statue of Verena, normally seated with a book in her lap, a pair of scales in her left hand, and her right hand resting on the hilt of a sword. Smaller rooms lead off from the main temple, including a library and chambers for the attendant priests. Each temple has at least one meeting room where negotiations can take place under the eyes of the goddess.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances set by Verena normally involve the recovery or preservation of knowledge, the righting of an injustice, or the resolution of a dispute. Cultists may also be sent to recover a long-forgotten book of lore, or to mediate in a difficult quarrel. This could be anything from a farmers’ boundary dispute to unpicking the complicated politics of two realms on the brink of war.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Strictures</span></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Never refuse to arbitrate a dispute when asked.</em></li>\n<li><em>Always tell the truth without fear or favour.</em></li>\n<li><em>Protect knowledge at all costs.</em></li>\n<li><em>Combat must be a last resort when all alternative routes are fruitless.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never become a tool of injustice or heresy.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iIfYOlNrLb0uiV8c]{Blessing of Fortune}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.2WN0muIB2BFd4kBO]{Blessing of Righteousness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.FRkIz2sR7ZC92W2G]{Blessing of Wisdom}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tMocig1z9dHKNiCT]{Blessing of Wit}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.jXyyzYWid3nruQmc]{As Verena is My Witness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.R6Q16WOXcPfaHnOb]{Blind Justice}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.oI3iwxVEXHRLSael]{Shackles of Truth}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.o5soyuEJoUk9HmCC]{Sword of Justice}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.DA4ZB3HkOh51vhuB]{Truth Will Out}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.fAlQcNUb6TZtPKqk]{Wisdom of the Owl}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/verena.webp"}

He then leads each soul from there to its final resting place: either Morr’s Underworld, or the afterlife of another god.

Most are plain structures of dark stone, distinguished by a broad doorway with a heavy lintel-stone — representing Morr’s Portal. The doors are always open, like the doors to the Kingdom of Death.&nbsp; Inside, the temples are bare. Any necessary furniture and other equipment is kept in storage until it is needed for a funeral service. Shrines to Morr also take the form of a gateway, usually consisting of two plain pillars and a lintel. In some cases, one pillar is white marble and the other black basalt.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Morr’s penances typically involve hunting Necromancers and destroying Undead, or finding and restoring burial places and holy sites fallen to disuse and disrepair.

Karl-Franz would love to issue an edict limiting ownership of the bridge, but Altdorf &rsquo;s wealthier burghers demand the defence of private property rights despite the inconvenience.</p>"}

Both Altdorf and Nuln boast sizeable districts populated by High Elf merchants who ship goods down the Reik through Marienburg to the sea. These merchants are by far the most numerous of the High Elves found in Reikland, alongside diplomatic entourages and support staff. Aloof, alien, and long-lived, they are a passionate, emotional folk widely perceived in the Reikland to be the most beautiful of the species, and also the most arrogant.</p>\n<p>Tall and slender with delicately pointed ears, most Elves have long, fine hair and melodious voices. Although they might look frail, their physiology is not only surprisingly strong, but also extraordinarily agile and dextrous. There are very few noticeable gender differences between Elves, which often causes confusion among Humans who interact with them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The High Elves, who call themselves &lsquo;Asur&rsquo;, are native to Ulthuan, a magical island lying to the west of the Old World. A proud species, they boast of being amongst the oldest of the world&rsquo;s civilisations. High Elves show considerable disdain for Dwarfs, with whom they have a long history of conflict. Since their abandonment of the Old World in the aftermath of the War of the Beard, the Asur have been torn apart by civil war, the &lsquo;kinstrife&rsquo;, although this isn&rsquo;t something they discuss openly with outsiders. As a result of this millennia-long struggle, Elves from the war-torn north of Ulthuan tend to be hard-bitten, practical, and ruthless.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>High Elven society is tightly-bound by ritual and discipline, intended to keep soaring emotions in check and provide focus for their complicated intellects. Seeming contrary to this, some Asur revel in wild adventure. The term &lsquo;Sea Elf &rsquo; is often used by other species to describe the dauntless High Elves who venture beyond Ulthuan&rsquo;s safe shores as mariners, traders, and diplomats, and who stand in stark contrast to any grim Asur accompanying them who follow warrior lifestyles.</p>\n<h3>Opinions</h3>\n<h4>On Reiklander Humans&hellip;</h4>\n<p><em>&lsquo;They are corrupt, jealous, and rapacious in their short-lived hungers.

The cells are independent of each other and members do not know the identity of members of other cells.</li>\n<li>The cells have different plans and goals.</li>\n<li>A Purple Hand cell normally consists of nine members, and a town or city can have three or even more cells depending on its size.<span style=\"font-family: ACaslonPro-Regular; font-size: 9pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><br style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /></span></li>\n<li>In large cities such as Altdorf, Nuln, and Middenheim the cult is better organised. Groups of cells are organised under the auspices of three governing Ordos. These are the <strong>Ordo Impedimentae</strong>, the <strong>Ordo Novitiae</strong>, and the <strong>Ordo Terribilis</strong>.<span style=\"font-family: ACaslonPro-Regular; font-size: 9pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><br style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /></span></li>\n<li>The Magistri of a branch will meet on occasion for certain ceremonies (keeping their identity a secret).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Ordo Impedimentae</h3>\n<p>The Ordo Impedimentae are tasked with securing funds and resources for the cult. Their members fulfil the roles of treasurer and quartermaster, and stand at the apex of a wider network involving burglary and racketeering. Whilst the Ordo Impedimentae operates like an organised criminal gang they must be exceedingly careful. Regular criminals benefit from a loose but mutually supportive code of conduct, but only the most depraved crime lord would consider extending such niceties to followers of Chaos. Criminals must be wary of alerting the town guard, but they don&rsquo;t normally have to worry about the more meticulous investigations of witch hunters.</p>\n<h3>The Ordo Novitiae</h3>\n<p>The Ordo Novitiae are concerned with scouting for talent and recruiting new members. Whilst they do occasionally resort to blackmail or force, hard lessons have taught them to identify and recruit true believers, rather than attempt to coerce people into the worship of Tzeentch. The members of this Ordo have to be particularly ruthless and hard-nosed, as it falls to them to silence any cult novice who turns out to be a security risk.</p>\n<h3>The Ordo Terribilis</h3>\n<p>The Ordo Terribilis handle research and development for the cult. They instruct magically adept members of the cult in the rituals and spells of Tzeentch, consort with Daemons, and study forbidden lore. Given the limited pool of expertise available to the cult, the Ordo Terribilis in each major city focuses on a particular field. In Nuln they carry out a sociological experiment encouraging mutants to build communities within the confines of the city. In Middenheim they experiment on fusing the dark arts of the Daemonologist with those of the Necromancer.</p>\n<h3>Leadership</h3>\n<p>Each Ordo is headed by three <strong>Magistri</strong>, who tend to be accomplished in another useful field (such as wizards, scholars, or assassins) or who have worked their way into a position of authority outside of the cult (such as guild chairpersons or members of the aristocracy). Together the Magistri from the three Ordos form an<strong> Inner Circle</strong> of nine.</p>\n<p>Within the Inner Circle the individual heads of each of the Ordos form a governing council known as the Triumvirate.</p>\n<p>At the top of the hierarchy the Triumvirate elect one of their members to be the regional cult leader: <strong>Magister Magistri</strong>.</p>\n<p>The cult&rsquo;s inner circle are usually ignorant of each other&rsquo;s identities. They meet only twice a year on Hexenstag and Geheimisnacht, when Morrslieb waxes full. Donning cult robes and elaborate masks, they share their achievements and draw up plans for the next phase. On ending their business, they undertake forbidden rites, sing praises to Tzeentch and conclude with a human sacrifice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many secret societies in the Empire who work in good faith to promote needful reforms. Unfortunately, such groups provide the Purple Hand with rich recruiting opportunities, as well as a degree of cover for their more sinister plots. All too often witch hunters have put na&iuml;ve revolutionaries to the flames whilst true Chaos followers escape. Characters may find themselves drawn into reformist movements only to discover that they are being manipulated by darker designs.</li>\n<li>Cult meetings held on nights when Morrslieb is full present witch hunters with their only real opportunity to catch a number of cultists at the same time. Were the characters to learn about such a cult meeting they could be richly rewarded, and offered a chance to join in the effort to capture the inner circle at work.</li>\n<li>Cult gatherings are an opportunity for Purple Hand members to update their recognition codes, a series of gestures by which they identify co-conspirators. Some cultists with imperfect memories might make note of these codes. If the Characters were to stumble across such notes they could begin to thoroughly infiltrate the cult.</li>\n<li>Individual Magisters Magistri coordinate the cult operations of a given region or city, but there is no record of them ever consulting formally with one another. Is the Purple Hand an informal network of cults who share regalia and modus operandi, or is there a higher authority to whom the Magister Magistri are subordinate?</li>\n</ul>"}

As noted in Money to Burn, all coin remaining at the end of your ‘Between Adventures’ phase is lost before the next adventure begins unless it is saved with this Endeavour. So, if you have a lot of money spare it may be worth a trip to the bank. If you are using a Banking Endeavour to retain your money, you must first decide whether to save your money by investing it with a reputable banking institution, or to stash it somewhere less secure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Investing</strong>: You must be of the Gold and Silver social tiers to save with a banking house. Your money will be reasonably safe and it should accrue interest. When undertaking a Banking Endeavour to deposit money in a bank, determine the interest rate of your account, by choosing a number between 1 and 10 (alternatively you may simply roll 1d10). This is the rate of interest you will accrue, and also how risky the investment is. Withdrawing funds requires another Banking Endeavour. This may take place immediately after the initial Endeavour, or after subsequent adventures have occurred. Roll 1d100: if you roll equal to or less than your rate of interest, the venture has gone bankrupt and you have lost all of your money. If you roll over the interest rate, you receive your initial funds, plus the interest accrued.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stashing</strong>: All characters may choose to stash their loot. This is a risky strategy, involving hiding it on your person, in your mattress, or burying it somewhere. Stashed money never accrues any interest. Players may withdraw money from a stash before the start of an adventure, without undertaking an Endeavour. Roll 1d100: if you roll 10 or lower, your stash has been found and you have lost all your money, otherwise you recieve your initial funds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you successfully withdraw your funds they will be available for you when you start your next adventure, in addition to any funds secured via an Income Endeavour.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:<em> Gerhard and Ulli’s courage in the face of a Greenskin horde (not to mention some judicious looting) has earned them a haul worth 10 gold crowns each. The ever-prudent Gerhard decides to place his money with the esteemed banking house Bent, Crooke &amp; Scarper. The GM rolls 1d10 with a result of 6. Gerhard will earn 6% interest on his deposit (12 silver shillings, see page 288), and the bank will fail if he rolls 6 or less on d100 when he tries to make a withdrawal.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>Ulli — a gambler at heart — buries his money near a mile-marker on the road to Ubersreik. He doesn’t need to make an Endeavour to get access to his loot, but tragically he rolls 07 when he tries to recover it, and finds nothing but freshly disturbed earth, an empty chest, and whole heap of regret.</p>"}

{"_id":"TzRMvkOA1BuSJIum","name":"Scene 4 - The Investigation","permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"nIM7VxtzVOzcOrxh","sort":400001,"flags":{},"content":"<h2>Scene 4: The investigation</h2>\n<p>There are a few hooks that the PCs could investigate. One way or another, I expect their investigations will lead them to the docks, and then to the Black Eagle for @JournalEntry[vIvbA3n23gB3IoQk]{Scene 6} and the climax of the adventure. The shorter encounters in @JournalEntry[x0QhtZboWNFz4oAC]{Scene 5} can also be used to add a bit of local colour, and to slow down the pace of the investigation a little if needed. Ideally, the scenario should end with a fight, so that we can test out the combat rules, so I don&rsquo;t intend to make the investigation too difficult for the PCs.</p>\n<p>The docks have been hit by the recent economic slumps, and quite a lot of the area was very rundown to begin with. There&rsquo;ll be a lot of boarded up windows, a strong smell of piss and rotting fish and occasional seagulls fighting over a fish carcass. Examples of typical graffiti might include a crude painting of a fish devouring a man (a gang symbol of the Fish), a bloodied docker&rsquo;s hook (a gang symbol of the Hooks), or a sketch of Emperor Karl Franz with a penis in his mouth and the written slogan &ldquo;The Ratman Cometh&rdquo; scrawled underneath it.</p>\n<p>Typical dockland NPCs will include whores and their pimps, beggars, sailors, stevedores, discharged soldiers and apocalyptic preachers. There are probably also a fair few Hooks and Fish about, some of whom might take the PCs presence as a provocation, particularly if they linger here for too long. This could potentially be another way to end the session with a fight scene if the investigation isn&rsquo;t getting anywhere.</p>\n<h3>Investigating the silverware:</h3>\n<p>The stolen silverware will have been fenced with a pawnbroker. I&rsquo;m imagining a dilapidated and heavily shuttered shop in a shady part of town. They can either interrogate the owner or ransack the place to find the stolen silverware. Either way, some sort of test is probably required. The silver goblets have been melted down, but PCs who find the crucible filled with freshly melted silver will hopefully feel they have enough evidence to start asking more pointed questions.</p>\n<p>The pawnbroker&rsquo;s of Bretonnian heritage, and is known locally as &ldquo;Jacques the Hat&rdquo; because of the battered tricorn he wears to conceal his receding hairline. Jacques doesn&rsquo;t feel any particular loyalty to his clients. Jacques won&rsquo;t be willing to implicate himself (and would like to keep the silverware if at all possible) - but he will rat out the seller fairly quickly if the PCs start applying pressure. Assuming they&rsquo;ve found the silver, a <strong>Routine (+20) Intimidate </strong>Test will be enough to make him spill the beans: this becomes <strong>Easy (+40)</strong> if they rough him up a bit, or offer some sort of financial reward for his assistance. The PCs should really return the silver to the Ottingers, but if they&rsquo;re irredeemably corrupt then they could probably sell it on for about 2 GCs (subject to Haggle checks etc). Jacques will claim to have a receipt for the silver, but it&rsquo;s a fairly transparent fabrication &ndash; the receipt purports to show that he bought the silver from a ship captain (&ldquo;Jan Schmidt&rdquo;) who was travelling downriver from Marienburg.</p>\n<p>The silverware was brought in by a former soldier last night. (Jacques recognised that he was wearing an old army coat.) The pawnbroker will be able to supply a reasonable physical description (which probably includes some sort of tattoos or disfigurement to make him easier to trace, preferably whatever&rsquo;s consistent with the clues the PCs have already picked up on).</p>\n<p>Jacques&rsquo; responses are likely to be along the following lines: <em>&ldquo;What can I do for you, officers?&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing about that&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stolen goods? Officers, I&rsquo;m offended &ndash; they don&rsquo;t call me Honest Jacques for nothing!&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a receipt for that silver&rdquo; and &ldquo;Soldiers, you say? Look, now that I think about it, there was this soldier came calling by here last night &ndash; right shifty looking bugger he was, with gangland tattoos and a game leg. Wouldn&rsquo;t like to run into that one down a dark alley, let me tell you! I sent him packing, but I hear his gang are drinking at the Black Eagle &ndash; perhaps you can still catch them there if you hurry!&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Jacques has a crossbow under the counter to fend off robbers, but he won&rsquo;t risk pulling it on watchmen unless they seem intent on killing him (and even then he&rsquo;d rather flee).</p>\n<h3>Investigating the maid:</h3>\n<p>Investigating Ilse Grunberg might be a bit more difficult. The robbers paid her for the information she provided in advance of the heist, with money from their last job, and she&rsquo;s absconded. If the PCs are determined to investigate her, then they&rsquo;ll find her old landlady (known locally as the &ldquo;The Widow Hansen&rdquo; or &ldquo;Frau Hansen&rdquo;, although her given name is Gertrud). Frau Hansen&rsquo;s a lonely and slightly embittered old woman, who didn&rsquo;t particularly take to her pretty young lodger and is particularly aggrieved at the unpaid bills she left behind. Assuming the PCs are at least reasonably well behaved, Frau Hansen will be willing to invite them in for a cup of Mootland tea, and vent some of these frustrations (which will become increasingly venomous as the conversation goes on).</p>\n<p>Her home&rsquo;s clean and reasonably spacious, although poorly furnished, suggesting that she had money at one point but has come down in the world since. Similarly, her home is in what was once a very nice part of town, but many of the neighbouring buildings now bear gang graffiti and have boarded up windows. The PCs will notice a portrait of her late husband hanging above the mantelpiece. If asked, she will tell them that he was first mate of a merchant vessel.</p>\n<p>The following responses will give a flavour for her conversation: <em>&ldquo;How do you take your tea, officer?&rdquo; &ldquo;Fetch me down the green jar from the top shelf, would you, there&rsquo;s a dear&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;What a nice young man, your mother must be very proud&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Ilse Grunberg? Oh, yes, I remember that one &ndash; the little bitch skipped out without paying last month&rsquo;s rent&hellip; as if times weren&rsquo;t hard enough with that ridiculous window tax, and bread prices going up and up. Sigmar only know how we&rsquo;ll survive the winter&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Describe her? I suppose she was pretty enough in that empty-headed way young men seem to enjoy. Seemed very fond of soldiers &ndash; I warned her they weren&rsquo;t the marrying type, but the silly girl wouldn&rsquo;t listen&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Soldiers? Oh, yes &ndash; she had a whole gang of those ruffians sniffing around her skirts, they used to waste their evenings drinking and talking sedition at that grubby little dockland tavern, the Black Eagle. I hear a couple of them even fought over her &ndash; the rancid little tart must have loved that&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>If the PCs are so minded, it won&rsquo;t be too difficult to cultivate the Widow as a contact. She&rsquo;s lonely, and will be very happy to share the gossip she picks up with them on future adventures. If the PCs are indiscrete about where they&rsquo;re getting their information, this may result in the Hooks or Fish paying her a visit at some point, to teach her a lesson about the perils of talking to the Watch.</p>\n<h3>Investigating the robbers:</h3>\n<p>Investigating the robbers directly is unlikely to be productive, unless they already have strong leads. There are quite a few discharged soldiers in Altdorf now that the Storm of Chaos has ended, with widespread frustration at the unpaid wages still owed to those who served. Not all of them signed up willingly &ndash; many enlisted to avoid prison sentences.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the robbers are well on their way to becoming local heroes, and very few locals will want to be known to have ratted them out to the Watch.</p>\n<p>If the PCs keep digging, they&rsquo;ll learn that the ringleader of the gang in question&rsquo;s a bit of a celebrated local character. He ran with the Fish for a while, before being enlisted to fight in the War Against Chaos. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll run into one of his old comrades, who&rsquo;ll be able to tell them a bit about his service record, and his radical politics.</p>\n<h3>Investigating the law firm:</h3>\n<p>Vogel &amp; Stein are based in Altstadt. They&rsquo;re a well-established law firm, catering to the needs of their wealthy clients (and therefore tend to specialise in commercial and property law). Unless the PCs are very persuasive, they&rsquo;re not going to get anywhere by talking to the law firm directly. The lawyers will simply cite client confidentiality. They may not be willing to confirm that the minister&rsquo;s a client at all.</p>\n<p>Investigating the law firm more indirectly might reveal that they&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of business through intermediaries to buy up slum housing in the Old Docks on behalf of Obsidian Enterprises, and that some of the tenants have been evicted forcefully. These intermediaries are fairly rough characters, who are unlikely to much appreciate being investigated.</p>"}

Ogasse boasts a sizeable Tilean community, who consider themselves proper working Tileans as opposed to the poseurs of Little Tilea north of the river. The joke among Reiklanders, however, is that on arrival in Altdorf, the Tilean immigrants here couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to travel any further. In truth, Tilean names are only a little more common here than any other part of the city. Even the landlord of the Eagle of Luccini is a Reiklander.</p>\n<p>The area is respectable enough, and used to be quite fashionable, but is becoming increasingly run-down. At its centre, Schmutzplatz is vibrant and prosperous, and by day swings to the sort of urban vibrancy typical of any busy area of the city.

Attributes include Movement, ten Characteristics, Wounds, Fate, and Resilience.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Wait! That's Not Fair!</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">You may notice that not all characters are created equal. An Elf has significant Characteristic advantages, for example. Don&rsquo;t be deceived by numbers alone, there are many aspects to character generation and all the Species have advantages and disadvantages at each stage, some of them not always obvious.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Characteristics</h3>\n<p>Your ten Characteristics are used in Tests, to determine if you perform an action successfully. The Human average for these Attributes is 30. Those who are gifted, or well-practiced, may achieve scores of over 40; only the most dedicated and experienced will achieve scores over 60. Of course, other Species have their own strengths and weaknesses, so their averages are different, sometimes significantly so.</p>\n<h4>Determining Characteristics</h4>\n<p>When determining your Characteristics:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1) </strong>Roll 2d10 for each of the ten Characteristics and make a note of the results. If you feel your Character would be improved if you swapped round some of the dice roll results between Characteristics, move to the next step. If you stick with your random results, add the die rolls to the modifier for each Characteristic from the Attribute Table, write them on your Character Sheet and gain +50 XP.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2) </strong>Rearrange the ten numbers rolled under step 1, assigning each to a different Characteristic (and adding its modifier). If you&rsquo;re happy with this new mix, record them on your Character Sheet and gain +25 XP. If not, move to the next step.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3) </strong>If you&rsquo;re still not happy with your results, either roll again and swap the rolls around with no XP bonus, or you could ignore the dice completely! Instead, allocate 100 points across the 10 Characteristics as you prefer, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 18 allocated to any single Characteristic. Add the modifiers from the Attribute Table and record them on your Character Sheet. Like rolling again, there is no XP bonus for this option.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Weapon Skill (WS)</h4>\n<p>Your skill at fighting hand-to-hand, your ability to land a measured blow, and effectiveness in the free-for-all of a massed melee. It is also used for unarmed combat, where your body is the weapon!</p>\n<h4>Ballistic Skill (BS)</h4>\n<p>Your effectiveness at hitting with ranged weapons like bows and throwing knives, and for throwing things generally. It is also used as the basis for other ranged attacks like Trolls vomiting.</p>\n<h4>Strength (S)</h4>\n<p>How much damage you do in melee, how much you can lift, and how good you are at things like swimming and climbing.</p>\n<h4>Toughness (T)</h4>\n<p>Your physical hardiness. It helps you survive damage in combat but will also help with things like surviving harsh conditions and standing up to poison.</p>\n<h4>Initiative (I)</h4>\n<p>Speed of thought and reaction, especially in the heat of battle and when under pressure. It determines combat order, and helps you be the first to react to danger. It also determines your powers of intuition and perception.</p>\n<h4>Agility (Ag)</h4>\n<p>Physical coordination and natural athleticism, and the basis for things like running, riding, and hiding. Agility is also used for dodging blows in combat.</p>\n<h4>Dexterity (Dex)</h4>\n<p>Your affinity for performing fine and delicate manual tasks like playing a musical instrument or skilled manufacturing. It will also help you with things like sleight of hand and picking pockets.</p>\n<h4>Intelligence (Int)</h4>\n<p>Your powers of thought, analysis, and understanding. Useful for healing, evaluating, and general knowledge, and vital for the understanding and casting of magical spells.</p>\n<h4>Willpower (WP)</h4>\n<p>General strength of mind, and your ability to shrug off difficulty and plough on with the job in hand. It helps with resisting all sorts of influence and coercion, and guards against fear and terror.</p>\n<p>Fellowship (Fel)</p>\n<p>Your ability to get on with people and come across as generally pleasant and acceptable. It will help you when chatting to locals or commanding people in battle, charming the guards or attempting to bribe them, and, for pious characters, communicating with your deity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Characteristic Bonuses</h4>\n<p>The first or &lsquo;tens&rsquo; digit of each Characteristic is its bonus value. Characteristic Bonuses are used in a variety of different ways throughout the rules, particularly for limiting Talents and defining Spells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Strength (S) 39 equates to a Strength Bonus of 3. Willpower (WP) of 51 equals a Willpower Bonus of 5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>WOUNDS (W)</h3>\n<p>Your Wounds show how much Damage you can endure based on your physical power and your force of will to shrug off injury. See&nbsp; Chapter 5: Rules for how Wounds are used to track Damage.</p>\n<h4>Determining Wounds</h4>\n<p>Unlike other Attributes, Wounds are derived from your Strength Bonus, twice your Toughness Bonus,, and Willpower Bonus (abbreviated to SB, TB, and WPB on the Attributes Table). Refer to the Attributes Table to determine the Characteristic Bonuses used to calculate your Wounds. Note: Halflings have the Small Talent automatically and start with fewer Wounds, (see page 341).</p>\n<h3>Fate &amp; Fortune, Resilience &amp; Resolve</h3>\n<p>Your Fate represents your destiny, and is directly tied to your Fortune, a measure of your luck. Your Resilience is your inner strength, which is directly related to your Resolve, defining your grit. Your Resilience also comes with a Motivation, which is a single word or phrase describing what drives your character forwards. See page 170 for more on all of these.</p>\n<h4>Determining Fate and Resilience</h4>\n<p>You start with a base value for Fate and Resilience, and then have a number of Extra Points to spread between these two Attributes as you see fit. The numbers for these are shown in the Attributes Table. The more points you allocate to Fate, the luckier you are. By comparison, a higher Resilience shows you can steel through any situation.</p>\n<h4>Determining Fortune and Resolve</h4>\n<p>Your initial Fortune is equal to your Fate. Your initial Resolve equals your Resilience. Mark all four values on your sheet.</p>\n<h4>Determining Motivation</h4>\n<p>All characters choose a Motivation. It represents your Character&rsquo;s core essence, a word or phrase that sums up what you live for. In addition to the obvious roleplaying benefits for portraying your character, Motivation is used to help you regain Resolve points. When considering your Motivation, think of something that is fundamental to your character&rsquo;s nature. Also try to make your Motivation something fun to roleplay, and something that will work well with the other PCs and their motivations.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Gustavus, a young Scholar at the University in Altdorf, has &lsquo;Thrillseeker&rsquo; for his Motivation. He lives his life in pursuit of excitement and danger, and Gustavus may regain Resolve points when he actively seeks out risky situations; perhaps he provokes antagonism in taverns, or deliberately breaks the law by stealing the feathers from the caps of State Soldiers.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Clotilda, a Reiksguard Knight, has &lsquo;Protect the weak&rsquo; as her Motivation. She is driven to stand up to bullies and braggarts, risking life and limb to save the Reikland&rsquo;s citizenry. Clotilda will regain her Resolve whenever she rescues others, or puts herself in harm&rsquo;s way to protect another.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong><em>: Ebba is a &lsquo;Rebellious&rsquo; apprentice wizard studying at the Light College. She loves to break the rules of the College, flaunting her master&rsquo;s authority, and poking her nose into books best left undisturbed. She regains Resolve whenever she breaks the rules set for her by superiors.</em></p>\n<p>Other examples of potential motivations include: a &lsquo;Perfectionist&rsquo;, who loves to plan meticulously and draws energy from flawless execution of schemes; a &lsquo;Nurturer&rsquo;, who gains strength from caring for others, or rescuing them from difficult situations; a &lsquo;Penitent Martyr&rsquo;, who revels in hardship to atone for past misdeeds; or a &lsquo;Shining Wit&rsquo;, who&rsquo;s ever engaging in witty badinage and banter to lighten the mood. If you can&rsquo;t think of a Motivation don&rsquo;t worry. One may arise as you create more of your character, and the other players and the GM can always help. Even if you do have one, it&rsquo;s possible you may change your mind later. @JournalEntry[Bringing Your Character To Life]{Step 8) Bringing Your Character To Life} is a good time to reconsider what your Motivation will be.</p>\n<h4>Movement (M)</h4>\n<p>Movement is used to determine your Walk and Run speed. Standard Human Movement is 4. If using a grid for movement this indicates how many squares you can move in a Round, or inches across the table top. Over the longer term it indicates how many miles per hour you can comfortably travel on foot. For more on Movement, see @JournalEntry[Moving During Combat]</p>\n<h3>Advance Characteristics</h3>\n<p>Upon selecting a career as \"Current\", you will see small \"plus\" symbols appear next to certain characteristics. You can allocate a total of 5 advances across these characteristics as you choose. Enter these advances in manually, as clicking the plus symbols to advance will spend experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Characteristic Advances</em></h3>\n<p><em>Characteristic Advances show training or experience in your Characteristics. The number of Advances you have in the Characteristic is added to the initial Characteristic to show your current ability. So, if you have an initial Dexterity of 25, and 5 Dexterity Advances, your Dexterity is now 30.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"VFDvYGHCjiFj38WX"}
{"name":"Magic Rules","permission":{"default":0,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"SV4wmXUvuCNwQ0Nc","sort":100001,"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Magic"}},"content":"<h3>Second Sight</h3>\n<p>The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent allows you to perceive the Winds of Magic, and how magic influences the world around you. Second Sight affects all your senses, and how it manifests is dependent on individual experience and training: So, where Aqshy may have a hot, cinnamon odour to one pyromancer, it could feel like searing ear itches to another.</p>\n<p>If you have Second Sight, you may use any appropriate Skills with your aethyric senses, most commonly your Intuition, Perception, and Track Skills. For example, a wizard following the trail of a fleeing witch could make a Track test, following the faint traces of Dhar in the witch&rsquo;s path, rather than their literal footsteps. Or a Witch looking to see what kind of magic had gathered locally could use Perception to examine the Winds more closely. Like the mundane senses, Second Sight does not simply switch off, which is a source of great discomfort to those who would rather have no truck with the Winds of Magic but cannot help what they perceive. This means the GM may request Tests, or take Tests on your behalf, to see if you spot subtle magical details in your surrounding environment, even if you&rsquo;re not looking for them.</p>\n<p>Spells</p>\n<p>There are four types of spell: Petty, Arcane, Lore, and Chaos spells. Petty spells are simple tricks that use negligible amounts of magic. Arcane Spells are generic spells open to those studying any Lore of Magic or Chaos Magic. Lore spells are those you can only learn if you know that Lore; i.e. to learn spells from the Lore of Fire, you need the Arcane Magic (Fire) Talent. Chaos spells are those practiced by those who&rsquo;ve lost their souls to Chaos.</p>\n<h4>Memorising Spells</h4>\n<p>Holding the complex linguistic structures of Language (Magick) in mind is a challenging task, so simply transcribing a spell into your grimoire does not allow you learn a spell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To memorise a spell &mdash; and therefore be able to cast it without access to your grimoire &mdash; you typically need to spend the amount of XP noted in your spellcasting Talent. Once a spell has been memorised, a spellcaster knows it permanently, barring special circumstances.</p>\n<h3>Casting Test</h3>\n<p>To cast a spell, make a <strong>Language (Magick) </strong>Test. If you succeed, match your SL to the Casting Number (CN) of the spell (listed in the individual spell description). If your SL is equal to or higher than the CN of the spell, it is cast as explained in the spell&rsquo;s description. If failed, the spell attempt fails, and nothing else happens.</p>\n<h4>Critical Casting</h4>\n<p>If the casting roll is a Critical, the Winds of Magic have flared dangerously high, granting you extra power, but at a cost. Unless you have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.BYChSVfMG004eflQ]{Instinctive Diction} Talent, you roll on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table} as the power moves beyond your control, but you may also choose one of the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Critical Cast</strong>: If the spell causes Damage, it also inflicts a Critical Wound.</li>\n<li><strong>Total Power</strong>: The spell is cast, no matter its CN and your rolled SL, but can be Dispelled.</li>\n<li><strong>Unstoppable Force</strong>: If you scored enough SL to cast your spell, it cannot be Dispelled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Fumbled Casting</h4>\n<p>If you lose control of the magical energy you are channelling, things invariably go awry. If you Fumble your Casting Test, you suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table}.<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Malignant Influence</em></h3>\n<p><em>Casting close to sources of Corruption makes controlling the Winds of Magic much more difficult. When attempting a Language (Magick) or Channelling Test in the vicinity of a @JournalEntry[Corruption]{Corrupting Influence}, any roll of an 8 (representing the eight-pointed symbol of Chaos) on the units die results in a @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast} as the Magic goes wild. If you already have a Minor Miscast on the Test for another reason, the Miscast escalates to a @Table[majormis]{Major Miscast}.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong>This is available through a checkbox in the roll dialog</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Duration</h4>\n<p>If a spell is successfully cast, it remains in effect for its Duration unless it is dispelled. You may not simply end your spells already in play, but you may attempt to Dispel them.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Grimoires</h4>\n<p>Some spellcasters own a spellbook, or grimoire, in which they transcribe their spells. Apprentices copy spells from their master, while experienced wizards will actively seek out new spells from other wizards, often trading spells for favours. A spellcaster may cast a spell directly from a grimoire if the spell belongs to a Lore they possess. Doing so doubles the Casting Number.</p>\n<h4>Magic Missiles</h4>\n<p>Some spells are marked as magic missiles ; these are damage-causing spells that all follow the same rules. When a magic missile is successfully cast and targets another character, the Hit Location struck is determined by reversing the dice rolled on the Language (Magick) Test and referring to the Hit Location Table (see page 159). The SL of the Language (Magick) Test is added to the spell&rsquo;s listed Damage and your Willpower Bonus to determine the total inflicted Damage. This Damage is reduced by the target&rsquo;s Toughness and Armour Points as normal.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Touch Spells in Combat</h4>\n<p>Certain spells require you to touch the target. If in combat, or if the target is unwilling to be touched, you must make an <strong>Opposed Melee (Brawling) </strong>Test (generally opposed by the Melee or Dodge Skill) after completing the Casting Test. If you do this and your spell was a magic missile , the Melee (Brawling) Test is used to determine Hit Location struck, not the Language (Magick) Test.</p>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<p>Spellcasters may channel their magic through an appropriate ingredient before unleashing their spells. Doing this offers protection against Miscasts as the attuned ingredient absorbs the worst of any magical backlash.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you use an ingredient when casting, any suffered Major Miscast becomes a Minor Miscast, and any Minor Miscast has no effect. If used in this way, the ingredient is consumed or destroyed by the process, even if no Miscast was rolled.</p>\n<p>Ingredients cost the CN in silver shillings for Arcane and Lore spells. Whenever you purchase a new ingredient, mark on your character sheet which spell it supports; ingredients only work for specific spells, not for all spells in your Lore. For those looking to add character to their ingredients, sample ingredients for each of the primary Lores of Magic are provided by the individual spell lists.</p>\n<h4>Limitations</h4>\n<p>As spells are spoken, you must be able to speak &mdash; not gagged, strangled, or underwater &mdash; to cast. If your voice is inhibited, the Difficulty of your Language (Magick) Test to cast a spell should be increased by the GM. Further, the Language of Magick needs to be spoken (or sung, for those using the Lore of Light) clearly, and often loudly, to ensure spells work; magic is anything but subtle. As a loose guide, the higher the CN of a spell, the louder the spell is chanted.</p>\n<p>Each of your spells can only be in effect once, meaning you have to wait for a cast spell to come to an end, or be dispelled, before using the same spell again. Further, spells providing bonuses or penalties do not stack. Instead, the best bonus and worst penalty is applied from every spell cast upon you. So, if you had a spell providing a bonus of +20 Willpower, and another providing +10 Willpower, you gain a bonus of +20 Willpower, not +30.</p>\n<p>Lastly, unless otherwise specified, you always need to be able to see &mdash; i.e. have Line of Sight &mdash; to your target.</p>\n<h3>Channelling Test</h3>\n<p>Some magical spells require far more magic than can normally be found ambiently flowing through the world. To power such spells, it is possible to draw the Winds of Magic and concentrate them into a more powerful form by using the Channelling Skill. Channelling the Winds of Magic can be a dangerous procedure, but it is the only sure way to cast some powerful spells. To channel magic for a spell, make an Extended Channelling Test.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When your SL reaches the CN of your selected spell, you have channelled enough magic to cast it. On the next Round, you can cast your spell using the normal Casting rules, but count the chosen spell&rsquo;s Casting Number as 0. If the casting Test fails, you also lose all your channelled magical energy, and suffer a Minor Miscast as it all writhes free from your Aethyric grasp.</p>\n<h4>Critical Channelling</h4>\n<p>If you roll a Critical when Channelling, you have channelled a mighty flow of magic and can cast your spell next Round regardless of the SL you&rsquo;ve scored in the Extended Test so far; however, so much magic so quickly concentrated in one place results in some magical backlash: roll 1d100 on the Minor Miscast Table unless you have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.1IZWRr7BYOIcqPlQ]{Aethyric Attunement} Talent.</p>\n<h4>Fumble</h4>\n<p>Channelling the Winds of Magic in a large flow is dangerous. You count any double or any roll ending in a 0 over your Skill as a Fumble, so, 00, 99, 90, 88, and so on. If you fumble a Channelling Test, you suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the Major Miscast Table.</p>\n<h4>Interruptions</h4>\n<p>Concentration is vital when channelling. If you are distracted by anything &mdash; loud noises, suffering damage, flashing lights, or similar &mdash; you must pass a <strong>Hard (&ndash;20) Cool </strong>Test, or suffer a @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast} and lose all SL you have accrued in the Extended Channelling Test so far.</p>\n<h3>Repelling the Winds</h3>\n<p>Wearing colours appropriate to the Wind of Magic you are manipulating helps attract the magic to you. This is the reason most wizards choose to dress in the traditional garb of their order.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All Casting and Channelling Tests suffer a &ndash;1 SL penalty if you are dressed inappropriately for the Wind of Magic you are trying to attract, as determined by the GM. Specifically, metal and leather armour repel most of the Winds: metal is laden with the golden wind Chamon , while leather retains traces of the amber Ghur . As such, spellcasters wearing armour suffer &ndash;1 SL penalty to all Casting and Channelling Tests for every Armour Point on the location with the most armour. Casters with the <em>Arcane Magic (Metal) </em>Talent may wear metal armour without penalty; those with <em>Arcane Magic (Beasts)</em> Talent may ignore penalties from leather armour.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Dispelling</h3>\n<p>If a spell targets you, or a point you can see within Willpower yards, you may oppose the Casting Test with Language (Magick) as you chant a counterspell. Make an Opposed Language (Magick) Test. If you win the Opposed Test, you dispel the incoming spell; if you lose, the spell uses the SL of the Opposed Test to determine whether the casting was successful as normal. You may only attempt to dispel a single spell every Round.</p>\n<h4>Dispelling Persistent Spells</h4>\n<p>If a spell has a lasting effect, you may attempt to dispel that spell for your Action. This is done by making an <strong>Extended Language (Magick)</strong> Test. When your SL reaches the CN of the ongoing spell, you successfully dispel it.</p>\n<p>Multiple spellcasters attempting to dispel the same spell each roll separately. If they cast using the same Lore, they may decide to make an Assisted Test instead.</p>\n<h3>Using Warpstone</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Officially the use of warpstone is precluded by the powers that be. Unofficially, I can say that it is officially never used within this college. Officially, I cannot say what unofficial uses it might have.

Not such an unusual event in these squalid areas, but Clemons Siberg was a respectable member of the community, a loving family man and loyal employee. Or perhaps not, as the case may be. Siberg was having a long term relationship with a @JournalEntry[Wu5dEX0wwpn6TDaJ]{prostitute from the Street of a Hundred Taverns}, the latest in a long line of affairs. Additionally, to finance this double-life, he has been selling information about his company to Its rivals.</p>\n<p>His brother-in-law Mikhail Pallenburg, who has always hated him, learned of Clemons&rsquo; mistress and when confronted, Clemons revealed that he intended to move in with the girl. Appalled at the disgrace this would bring upon his sister, Pallenburg followed Clemons until they were alone. After unsuccessfully trying to convince him to change his mind Mikhail killed him in cold blood.</p>\n<p>To complicate matters Clemons was carrying a set of records which he intended to sell to the blackmailer, &lsquo;Spices&rsquo; Bob. However, these were stolen from the body by a local thief, who has no idea what he has.</p>\n<h3>What happened that Fateful Night</h3>\n<p>Investigating the murder will centre around the details of Siberg&rsquo;s last night alive. The PCs will find all these out slowly, but they are presented below as a summary for the GM. The times are approximate, the exact times unknown to the characters, who will say &lsquo;early evening&rsquo;, dusk, just before dinner etc..</p>\n<p><strong>6:00</strong> Siberg leaves work.</p>\n<p><strong>6:30</strong> Arrives home and argues with Pallenburg, changes clothes and leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>7:00</strong> Has dinner at&nbsp;Bistro de Bianchi.</p>\n<p><strong>7:45</strong> He and Alexander Lommel get a carriage to the @JournalEntry[bb5O0d6JocujJdU4]{Sullen Knight}, where they meet Ingrid and Elisabeth. After a drink they leave as couples.</p>\n<p><strong>10:30</strong> Siberg returns to the Sullen Knight&nbsp;and meets &lsquo;Spices&rsquo; Bob, the blackmailer, whom he is to pay off. He tries to use the stolen records instead. They argue and Siberg is thrown out.</p>\n<p><strong>10:45</strong> Pallenburg and Siberg fight. Siberg drops his pistol after firing it.</p>\n<p><strong>11:00</strong> Siberg returns to @JournalEntry[Wu5dEX0wwpn6TDaJ]{Ingrid&rsquo;s house} where she bandages his wounds, before he leaves again.</p>\n<p><strong>11:30</strong> Pallenburg kills Siberg with Siberg&rsquo;s pistol and then batters him to death with his walking stick.</p>\n<p><strong>5:00 a.m.</strong> @JournalEntry[HMHG0ElZFJH400c8]{Erik Witzelheim} wakes up to find the body and takes the book.</p>\n<h3>Clemons Siberg</h3>\n<p>So who was Clemons Siberg, and why was he killed? Outwardly, he was a respected member of the community and a valued employee. Friends will say that he loved his wife and son and could always be counted on for help. Of course, the reality was somewhat different.</p>\n<p>He was born on a farm in Hochland, but its environs could do little to entertain his intellect and desires, and with ambition as his guide, he journeyed to Altdorf. Throughout his life he remained a deeply superstitious person, a trait that kept him from the charms of Chaos. He learned to read and conduct himself with class, and in time impressed the young Edith Pallenburg. Edith, the youngest daughter of a minor noble who had made his fortune as a Merchant, was flattered by this handsome young man&rsquo;s attentions.</p>\n<p>Becoming friends with her father as he wooed Edith, it wasn&rsquo;t long before they were married. Days later, her brother Mikhail returned home and was horrified to find his sister married to someone beneath her. Although deeply distraught, Mikhail kept his silence. As the years passed, Clemons started to distance himself from his wife, indulging his taste for wine and women. Meanwhile, he was rising in the company, believing it would soon be his. That was until Mikhail sold it after his fathers death. Stuck in the same position for years, Clemons still continued his double-life.</p>\n<p>With money running short he Started to sell company records to the Reik and Talabec Trading Company. These have been used to drive the company close to bankruptcy. Recently, he fell for a prostitute in the Docklands area and pays her to live as his mistress. Tired of his lifelong deceptions Clemons began to flaunt her openly. This enraged Mikhail, who eventually confronted and killed him.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

There, the majority of the capital&rsquo;s docklands and shipyards can be found.</p>\n<p>Warships of the Imperial First Fleet are anchored everywhere, pennants flying, cannons bristling on every deck. Many of the ships, which come in all sizes, have never seen the sea. The city of Marienburg, at the mouth of the River Reik many hundreds of miles downstream, charges extortionate taxes for any warships passing through, so the Empire&rsquo;s fleet only rarely leaves the Reik.</p>\n<p>the truly enormous greatship Emperor Wilhelm III, said to have a crew of over a thousand, and claims it has never left the Reiksport in its 70 years of service. He also identifies several prison hulks, and happily states they are ruled by the river criminals they are supposed to incarcerate.</p>\n<h2>Weissbruck</h2>\n<p>Weissbruck is a swiftly growing town on the River B&ouml;gen. It is ruled by the recently ennobled House Gruber, a family that may be rich because of its deep mines in the Skaag Hills, but has little in the way of status. Less than a century ago, Wiessbruck was just another small farming and fishing village, but with the opening of the nearby mines and the construction of the canal it has expanded rapidly.</p>\n<p>It is now a bustling merchant town, and the sound of construction rings everywhere as new buildings expand the outskirts to all sides. Warehouses line the canal and river banks, storing coal and iron ore from the nearby mines, wool and wine from B&ouml;genhafen, and all manner of goods from Altdorf, Carroburg, and the Vorbergland Canals.</p>\n<h2>Carroburg</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Was seat of the Drakwald Emperors</li>\n<li>Was part of Reikland</li>\n<li>Is now capital of Middenland, but is very southern - Middenlanders see Middenheim as their spiritual home - seat of the Wolf Emperors</li>\n<li>Leopold von Bildhofen - descendent of Magnus the Pious</li>\n<li>Dragon carved cliffs - Drakwald Emperors</li>\n<li>The Carroburg Greatswords + history</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Carroburg, Middenland&rsquo;s capital, is built on steep slopes rising from the Reik&rsquo;s northeast bank. Once a royal city, it is now a maze of twisting streets and stairs, with one&rsquo;s height above the river &mdash; and the city&rsquo;s effluent &mdash; serving as a sign of status. The cliff faces are carved with an impressive Dragon, a reminder of the time when it was Drakwald&rsquo;s capital. It is also home to the Empire&rsquo;s finest school for oratory, another relic of its days as a royal city.</p>\n<p>Atop the city sit two palaces: The Drakschloss and the Palace of Glass. The Drakschloss is the larger of the two, the nowabandoned residence of the Drakwald Emperors. It is ancient and tall with many narrow windows, all sealed with chains.</p>\n<p>Once majestic and welcoming, it&rsquo;s been shunned since Emperor Boris Goldgather and his court died there in 1115 in the Great Plague. Any attempts to reopen it have ended in madness and death &mdash; even thieves avoid it like the plague.</p>\n<p>The Palace of Glass belongs to the Grand Duke Leopold von Bildhofen, the Prince of Carroburg. The family is an old one, tracing its roots back to Drakwald nobility, and even claiming Emperor Magnus as a relative. Although the Grand Duke leaves Carroburg to his younger brother and heir, Siegfried, and lives on family estates at Bildhofen, he often returns for important occasions. Leopold holds ceremonies at the palace to remind all of his family&rsquo;s claim to the Imperial Throne, a potential challenge not unnoticed in Altdorf.</p>"}

To represent the unpredictable extremes of a life-or-death skirmish, there are Criticals — extraordinarily good hits — and Fumbles — egregious errors.</p>\n<h4>Criticals</h4>\n<p>Any successful Melee or Ranged Test that also rolls a double causes a Critical. This means you have dealt a significant blow, and it even happens when you are the defender in an opposed Test.</p>\n<p>If you score a Critical, your opponent receives an immediate Critical Wound as your weapon strikes true. Beyond that, SL is calculated as normal, as is who wins any Opposed Tests.</p>\n<h4>Fumbles</h4>\n<p>The converse of Criticals, any failed combat Test that also rolls a double is a Fumble, which means something very unfortunate has occurred. To determine what happens, roll on the @Table[oops]{Oops! Table}.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Deathblow</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some players like a heroic approach to combat, with characters able to wade through lesser foes. If this suits your style of play, use the following rule:&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>If you kill a melee opponent in a single blow, you may move into the space the character occupied and attack another opponent if there is one available. You may keep doing this a number of times equal to your Weapon Skill Bonus, and may not attack the same Character more than once on the same Turn. Some creatures are so big they can activate this rule without killing any opponents.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Opposed Tests and Fumbles</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">During an Opposed Test, it is possible to Fumble and still win if you score a higher SL than your opponent. This is fine, and not a little hilarious, as you ineffectually tussle with your even worse opponent, potentially injuring yourself in the process.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Molli swipes her dagger at her opponent and rolls 66 for a fumble with -3 SL, but her opponent rolls 92 for -5 SL. So, Molli wins with +2 SL over her opponent, gaining +1 Advantage, which she may quickly lose as she also has to roll on the Oops! Table to see what unfortunate accident will befall her.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><em>Misfires!</em></h3>\n<p><em>If you are using a Blackpowder, Engineering, or Explosive weapon, and roll a Fumble that is also an even number — 00, 88, and so on — your weapon Misfires, exploding in your hand. You take full Damage to your Primary Arm location using the units die as an effective SL for the hit, and your weapon is destroyed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"VhcFhdR6rNGVhdzu"}

Hieronymus Juniper is a local halfling who deals with imports of Mootland goods into Altdorf and their distribution to various shops and restaurants. He is an elder of the halfling community (through status rather than age) and he is an inveterate busybody. Since the second pattern killing Hiero (to his friends) has taken it on himself to voice the concerns of the halfling community to the Watch by pestering them constantly and blaming the continuing</p>\n<p>freedom of the killer on an institutionalised prejudice against halflings. He has enlisted the support of Markus Edvard Schmidt, an aging (and slightly demented) Verenan Investigator and Drago Vedris, a hard nosed reporter for the Altdorf Spieler.</p>\n<p>This episode should be played partly for laughs, and the GM should endeavour to make these three characters as grotesque as possible, and also to introduce the players to Drago, who is the Pattern Killer. In order to interject some degree of pathos into the scenario Drago should appear to be the most sympathetic of the 3 NPCs. Try to make him a self-effacing and humorous man, in comparison to Hiero&rsquo;s aggressive and unreasonable demands and Schmidt&rsquo;s rambling and disconnection. PCs may ask Drago if he can contact his Tilean colleague Mario Machi to help them with the Tileans back at the station. If so he is happy to help and agrees to meet them back at the station in thirty minutes. It is important to give Drago a noticeable verbal tic, however, as this will provide a clue to his guilt. A loud and highpitched feminine giggle is suggested here, and Drago should perform this a couple of times.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;No, I will NOT just be fobbed off on your captain.</p>\n<p>The halfling population of Altdorf have a RIGHT to know about what the putative &ldquo;Watch&rdquo; are doing in order to bring this murderer to justice, and I demand to know what you and your patrol are doing to help, as is only MY RIGHT, would you agree Markus?&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Erm, yes, ahem!

Guests begin to arrive on Angestag afternoon (the second-last day of the week), and the twenty-four hours before the wedding will prove to be quite eventful.</p>\n<p>Set out below is roughly what will happen during that time, subject to the effects of whatever the Characters decide to do &mdash; and to whatever tweaks, changes, and additional events you decide to throw in. The more, the merrier!</p>\n<h3>Angestag Afternoon</h3>\n<p>The trickle of guests arriving by road and river turns into a flood. At about 3:00 p.m. the river liner Emperor Wilhelm arrives amid much excitement, carrying most of the von Liebwitz party (assuming the Grand Duchess Emmanuelle pulled some strings to appropriate the liner; if not, the gravin and her staff arrive by barge). Although the Countess is not attending the wedding in person, she has sent several gifts with the small group of Nuln von Liebwitzes who have come along with their Ambosstein cousins.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the personal barges of other noble guests draw up alongside the castle&rsquo;s landing stage. Occasional scuffles break out between crew members when two or more barges arrive at the same time. Nobles &mdash; especially minor nobles &mdash; are very conscious of status and precedence: everyone has an opinion about whose boat should be the next to dock, and no one likes to be kept waiting.</p>\n<h3>Angestag Evening</h3>\n<p>A feast is held in the Great Hall to welcome the guests. @Actor[UsGTyYsKgNEo99yf]{Graf Wilhelm von Saponatheim} has spared no expense, even engaging legendary Bretonnian chef @Actor[1hFU3Yy7BNnxGIDd]{Marcel de Morceaux} for the occasion.</p>\n<p>Entertainers of all kinds amuse the guests, including a troupe of acrobats from faraway Ind. Gossip and scandal run up and down the hall as the assembled nobles get down to doing what nobles do best.</p>\n<p>Amid the merry-making, observant Characters will notice a few things.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test (<strong>Average (+20)</strong> for Entertainers) spots the acrobats from Ind are not playing the hall like the other entertainers. They start off moving around, collecting money thrown on the floor like everyone else, but after a few minutes pay close attention to a group of nobles from Telland. Any Courtier who learns this may make a <strong>Challenging (+20) Intelligence</strong> Test to recall that Countess Clothilde of Telland &mdash; who is sitting with the group in question &mdash; has been showing off a pink ruby all season. The ruby is said to have been bought by her son when he last sailed to Ind. The party may also notice that a richly dressed &lsquo;Halfling&rsquo; &mdash; in fact, Glimbrin in disguise &mdash; is watching the Countess and the Indish performers closely. If confronted, Glimbrin will fake a high-brow accent he learned from Seedling &mdash; his Halfling friend from A Rough Night at the Three Feathers &mdash; and attempt to remove himself from the situation.</p>\n<p>A<strong> Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test notes the bride-to-be, while outwardly radiant, looks around from time to time as if scanning the hall for someone or something. She does not even glance at the bridegroom. Karl-Heinz the bridegroom, for his part, is enraptured by an elegant sword that is to be his wedding gift from his new father-in-law. The blade placed on display in a glass case for all to see. Karl-Heinz spends much of the evening engaged in an excited discussion with Graf Wilhelm as they both fawn over its design. As the wine flows, Karl-Heinz cannot help but boast and brag about the heroic acts he will achieve with such a sword by his side.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test (<strong>Average (+20</strong>) for Courtiers, <strong>Easy (+40)</strong> for Rogues) spots a couple of the guests who seem out of place (this information is automatic for any Character with the <em>Etiquette (Nobles)</em> Talent). They are as expensively dressed as anyone else, but their clothes somehow don&rsquo;t quite fit them properly. They keep to themselves, and don&rsquo;t seem to know anyone else at the feast. Nobles may think they are provincial merchants who have somehow wangled an invitation, but Rogues will have no doubt they are criminals of some sort.</p>\n<p>At some time in the evening, the two sidle up to a table near the bottom of the hall, position themselves on either side of a young male guest, and a quiet but clearly heated exchange takes place. Courtiers may attempt a<strong> Challenging (+0) Intelligence</strong> Test to know that the young guest is a cousin of the von Saponatheims, Graf Johann von Gient, recently returned from Marienburg.</p>\n<p>You may add other incidents and events at will. For instance, drunken young nobles may decide to have a duel in the hall or somewhere else in the castle.</p>\n<p>A couple may slip off for a secret assignation, and be caught in flagrante delicto in some bedchamber, crypt, or shrubbery. A visiting servant may try to slip a piece of von Saponatheim silverware inside his or her clothing, or offer to sell family secrets to a rival. Practical jokes and acts of petty theft and vandalism may take place. Wine is flowing and high-spirited young Nobles are having a good time, so almost anything could happen.</p>\n<p>The feast ends around 11:00 p.m. Guests drift, stagger, and are carried to the various guest rooms. Nastassia is among the first to leave the tables, pleading a headache. By midnight, the Great Hall is deserted apart from a few servants clearing away the ruins of the feast and a cluster of crusty old Barons gathered around a brandy keg, loudly re-enacting various historical battles on an empty table using salt cellars, wine glasses, and pieces of fruit.</p>\n<h3>12 midnight</h3>\n<p>Albrecht&rsquo;s thugs (Plot 4) go to von Gient&rsquo;s room, having bribed one of the servants to find out its location. There is a muffled yell (requiring a <strong>Challenging (+0)</strong> Perception Test to hear if close by), and then everything is quiet.</p>\n<p>The two leave after some ten minutes, having stripped the room of all its valuables. They sneak out of the castle and head off downriver, where a boat waits to take them home to Marienburg.</p>\n<h3>12:15 a.m.</h3>\n<p>There is a commotion at the foot of the stairs leading to the solar tower. Graf Wilhelm has staggered out and collapsed, dragging a suit of armor noisily to the floor. White-faced and gasping, he stammers incoherently about a monster in his room. A rapid search by the servants turns up no trace of an intruder.</p>\n<p>The Graf has already failed a Psychology Test to resist <strong>Terror 3 </strong>and has three Broken Conditions; it is impossible to get any sense out of him. The Characters can try to calm him in any of the normal ways, though the servants may misinterpret their intentions and try to &lsquo;protect&rsquo; him. Once calm, he claims he was awakened by a glowing, snarling figure with a rotting head and golden jewellery. The thing made no attempt to harm him, but seemed angry and spoke harshly in a foreign tongue.</p>\n<p>The apparition was Inta-Dapesht, a Nehekharan Wraith (Plot 3).</p>\n<p>It was disturbed when its tomb was looted and the sword recently acquired by the graf was stolen. It has stayed close to the graf, seething with anger, but is taking advantage of its Ethereal nature to hide in a nearby wall.</p>\n<p>Once the graf gathers his wits, he shrilly demands the Characters exorcise the Wraith, or otherwise make the sword &lsquo;disappear&rsquo;. He states that the blade cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of the Ambossteins in this cursed state, for they will take any such gifts as an attempt to harm their family. However, he cannot arbitrarily deny the young bridegroom the gift given he loves it so.</p>\n<p>The spirit will then show itself again &mdash; along with its Terror 3 Trait &mdash; making the graf scream and faint. Unfortunately, Inta-Dapesht only speaks the ancient language of Nehekhara. It is unlikely any of the Characters can speak Nehekharan, but a <strong>Very Hard (&minus;30) Language (Magick</strong>) or <strong>Language (Arabyan) </strong>Test will allow a Character to pick out odd words here and there, and piece together enough of the message to understand. If Inta-Dapesht is attacked or otherwise offended &mdash; in other words, if the sword is not packed away and shipped back to Nehekhara &mdash; it will attack. Otherwise, it will accompany the sword back to its tomb, punishing anyone who interferes or delays its return as it goes.</p>\n<h3>12:30 a.m.</h3>\n<p>There is a scream from von Gient&rsquo;s room. A serving-maid, with whom he had made an assignation for the night, went to his room and found that it had been thoroughly wrecked.</p>\n<p>Von Gient is dead, tied to the bed with signs of having been severely beaten. Strangest of all, a fresh herring is wedged between his teeth. A successful <strong>Very Easy (+60) Lore (Marienburg</strong>) Test, or a <strong>Challenging (+0) Intelligence Test (Easy (+40)</strong> for racketeers; <strong>Average (+20)</strong> for Rogues), allows a Character to recognise the calling-card of the dreaded Marienburg crime lord, Albrecht the Fish.</p>\n<h3>12:45 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Outside the von Saponatheim family apartments, servants&nbsp;intercept a young guest who appears to have lost his way. He seems too drunk to speak &mdash; unable even to give his name or the name of his family so that he can be directed to the right quarters.</p>\n<p>This is Joachim Bitterfeld, the jeweller&rsquo;s apprentice from Altdorf who is planning to elope with the Baroness Nastassia.</p>\n<p>He has lost his way and is pretending to be drunk in the hope of being left alone so he can keep looking for Nastassia&rsquo;s room. A successful <strong>Average (+20) Intuition</strong> or <strong>Consume Alcohol</strong> Test will reveal that his drunkenness is feigned. Anyone who tries to search him will find that he is wearing two sets of clothes &mdash; one set is a disguise for Nastassia so that they can sneak out of the castle together.</p>\n<p>If left alone, Joachim will keep looking for Nastassia&rsquo;s room. He may cause disturbances from time to time as he goes into wrong rooms in various parts of the castle. He can be used as a distraction or an added complication whenever and wherever you choose.</p>\n<h3>1:00 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Many of the castle&rsquo;s servants are drunk by now, having finished off any partially empty cups and bottles they found while clearing away the feast. Left alone in the cellars, Manfred (Plot 6) has managed to free himself. He bursts into the kitchens, breaking the necks of two servants before anyone knows what is happening.</p>\n<p>With the strength of the desperate, he shrugs off all attempts to stop him, making his way up to the main hall.</p>\n<p>Unless he is stopped, Manfred will go through the family apartments, into the solar tower, and up to the master bedroom to kill his father. What he lacks in mental acuity he more than makes up in physical strength and rage.</p>\n<p>Stopping Manfred is a delicate matter. As a nobleman &mdash; despite his condition &mdash; it is theoretically illegal for a member of the lower orders to lay violent hands upon him. Graf Wilhelm may overlook this if Manfred can be subdued quickly and quietly, and returned to the cellars before anyone outside the family learns the truth. If Manfred is wounded, there will be consequences: paradoxically, though, the consequences for killing Manfred may be less severe if no one outside the family learns that he ever existed. His death, after all, solves a problem for the family by leaving Nastassia unchallenged as Graf Wilhelm&rsquo;s heir. However, if Manfred&rsquo;s existence becomes known, his killers will pay the price for the family&rsquo;s embarrassment as well as for killing him.</p>\n<h3>1:15 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Nastassia leaves her room to look for Joachim (see 12:45 a.m.). If she encounters anyone along the way she pretends to be sleepwalking, and will not resist anyone who tries to wake her and conduct her back to her room. Instead, she waits a few minutes before leaving again in search of her secret lover.</p>\n<p>Anyone who enters her room after this time will find a note to her father propped up on her dressing table. The note explains that she has eloped with her true love rather than face this arranged marriage.</p>\n<h3>1:30 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Posing as a wedding guest, the Dammenblatz agent (Plot 1) went to another guest&rsquo;s room (choose a guest of your own creation, preferably one with a connection to the Characters, or simply use a minor noble) to share a bottle of brandy or other nocturnal activity. The agent then quietly murders the other guest, and then sets out to take the body to the gravin&rsquo;s room. If encountered, the agent will pretend to be drunk: using the Entertain (Acting) Skill as best as possible. The agent claims the other guest has drunk himself unconscious, quite dead to the world, and will accept help in getting him back to his room; if successful, the agent will wait 15 minutes before trying again.</p>\n<p>When arriving at the gravin&rsquo;s room, the agent breaks in quietly and administers Moonflower vapours (WFRP, p, 306) from a small fire-pot to make sure she stays asleep. The body is then dumped by her bed, and a bloody dagger is left near her hand.</p>\n<p>The agent then scatters pages from a scandalous pamphlet about the room. While the pamphlet claims to describe and illustrate the rites of &lsquo;THE PRINTS OF PLESHUR&rsquo;, it is simple pornography and contains no heretical (or useful) information.</p>\n<p>Finally, the agent rings for the gravin&rsquo;s maid and hides under the bed while the maid discovers the body, planning to sneak out when the alarm is raised. If escape proves difficult, the agent will blend in with the crowd of guests and servants drawn by the maid&rsquo;s screams.</p>\n<h3>1:45 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Unless prevented, Nastassia and Joachim find each other and slip off into the closed wings so she can change into her disguise. This process takes about ten minutes, and then the two &lsquo;young nobles&rsquo; try to sneak out of the castle.</p>\n<h3>2:00 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Six young nobles (Plot 5) emerge from various guest rooms and make their way down to the wine cellar. If challenged, they pretend to be helping themselves to more wine and brandy.</p>\n<p>Once in the cellars, the cultists bar the door from the inside and begin their profane ritual. If Kavenner is alive, he leads the ritual. If Rechtshandler lives and is a Mutant, he cowers in the corner, sobbing over his sorry lot in life. A low chanting and the occasional moan and muffled scream may be heard through the cellar door if anyone listens carefully with an Average (+20) Perception Test.</p>\n<p>The cultists are casting a spell that will summon a number of Daemonettes to the castle. Once the summoning is complete, the cultists unbar the cellar door and the Daemonettes rampage through the castle in an orgy of destruction, pain, and worse. You should decide how many Daemonettes are summoned according to the capability of the Characters: there should be enough to provide a hard fight for the party and any allies it can muster, but not enough to ensure a one-sided slaughter. If matters look like they are getting out of hand, simply bring more of Graf Wilhelm&rsquo;s soldiers in to help.</p>\n<h3>2:15 a.m.</h3>\n<p>Four taggee (Plot 7) sneak out of the entertainers&rsquo; quarters and head for Dowager-Duchess Clothilde&rsquo;s rooms. They may be encountered anywhere you wish over the next 5-10 minutes as they attempt to locate their quarry. They are well-trained and extremely wary, and will avoid encounters when possible.</p>\n<p>At about the same time, Graf Josef von Angendorf has made his transformation into the notorious jewel thief, the Wraith. A black-clad figure slips out of the window of Graf Josef &rsquo;s guest room and climbs around the outside of the castle towards the dowager-duchess&rsquo;s chambers.</p>\n<p>If the taggee recover the ruby, they kill the dowager-duchess as an act of retribution and stealthily leave the castle, stealing a boat and heading downstream.</p>\n<p>If the Wraith steals the ruby before the taggee, they climb out of the window in pursuit of the thief. If the Characters become involved, this can lead to a dangerous but very entertaining running battle on the castle&rsquo;s walls and rooftops.</p>\n<p>Regardless of who steals the gem, Glimbrin will be waiting for them on the roof, and observes the escape. Begrudgingly, Glimbrin recognises he cannot hope to stop either party, so seeks out any of the Characters who have been sympathetic to him in the past. He explains the gem is stolen, and encourages them to give chase.</p>\n<p>If the Characters manage to recover the stolen gem, Glimbrin will, in turn, attempt to steal it from them, or offer any number of small trinkets &mdash; and even explosive devices if he was successful in his attempts during A Night at the Opera &mdash; in exchange. If pressed, and Glimbrin sees no way to recover the gem, he will make an impassioned speech about how the gem is the secret to defending his homelands from utter destruction. Of course, this is a lie.</p>\n<h3>Festag Morning</h3>\n<p>Assuming the castle isn&rsquo;t in lockdown because of the daemonic attack, servants begin to stir around 5:00 a.m. Some head for the kitchens to prepare the wedding breakfast; others head for the rooms of their aristocratic charges, ready to wash and dress them for the great day.</p>\n<p>In short order, screams of horror and cries of outrage are heard from various parts of the castle as the results of the night&rsquo;s events are discovered. This is an opportunity for you to involve the Characters in any plot that has escaped their notice so far.</p>\n<h3>The Runaways</h3>\n<p>If the bride and her paramour have managed to leave the castle, Gravin Maria-Ulrike will send the Characters after them. &lsquo;This is a very delicate situation,&rsquo; she explains. &lsquo;They must be recovered before word gets out. I don&rsquo;t care what you have to do, whom you have to bribe, or how much &mdash; just make sure they are both back before the end of the day. I&rsquo;ll do what I can to slow things down here &mdash; I&rsquo;ll spread the word that she&rsquo;s sick &mdash; but the wedding must go ahead. And don&rsquo;t hurt the young man; it&rsquo;s not his fault, really. Bring them both directly to me, and make sure no one else sees you.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>The errant pair made their way to the river, intending to steal a small boat from the moorings downstream of the castle. They planned to go downstream to Altdorf, where Joachim has a priestess of Shallya ready to marry them &mdash; although she does not know who Nastassia is, and the bride will be using a false name. From there, Joachim will collect his belongings from his lodgings, having already taken leave of his master to begin life as a journeyman. He plans to set out for Marienburg with his new bride, there to seek his fortune.</p>\n<p>You can decide how far the pair&rsquo;s plan has advanced. By dawn, they may be partway to Altdorf, but the adventurers will be able to catch them up in a few hours. Joachim is not a skilled sailor, and is unfamiliar with the stolen boat.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the pair may have been delayed at the moorings as Joachim tried to find a suitable vessel to steal. They may have been spotted by a boatman or other guard, and since the custom of the river is to string up boat thieves without trial, the adventurers may arrive just in time to save their lives. No one, after all, is going to believe a young slip of a girl &mdash; dressed in men&rsquo;s clothing, no less &mdash; when she is caught trying to steal a boat and tries to get out of trouble by claiming to be the young bride from the castle!</p>\n<p>It would be quite the tragedy should the Characters arrive too late in such circumstances.</p>\n<h3>The Heir</h3>\n<p>Even if Manfred&rsquo;s escape was contained and his existence remains a secret, the von Saponatheims &mdash; under some pressure from their soon-to-be in-laws &mdash; have decided that he should be sent away in secret, and housed under a false name in some place far, far away. Gravin Maria-Ulrike has arranged for her personal physician to drug the heir to Schloss Grauenberg with a powerful sedative, and orders the Characters to conduct him to the Great Hospice of Shallya at Frederheim (just north of Altdorf ), or some similar institution elsewhere in the Empire.</p>\n<p>The journey can be as simple or as complicated as you wish.</p>\n<p>Manfred&rsquo;s constitution is unusually strong, and the drug may not keep him fully subdued. Some rivals of the von Saponatheims &mdash; or worse, an agent working for Baron von Dammenblatz or perhaps the Toppenheimers &mdash; might get hold of the rumour that the true heir to Saponatheim is being moved in secret, and complicate the adventurers&rsquo; lives still further. Even if all goes well, any long journey in the Empire is fraught with perils great and small, especially when one is conveying an unwilling human cargo.</p>\n<h3>The Assassin</h3>\n<p>Gravin Maria-Ulrike is in no doubt that von Dammenblatz was behind the attempt to frame her for murder in the night. If the assassin has not yet been captured, the Characters are sent to finish the job. &lsquo;Kill the Dammenblatz fool only if you have to,&rsquo; she orders. &lsquo;Such creatures are far more valuable alive. If I can make the cretin name the Dammenblatz&rsquo;s in court, I can turn the tables and put this wretched business to rest once and for all.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Easy enough for a noblewoman to say, of course. Tracking and capturing a skilled assassin &mdash; especially one as talented as Dominique Herveaux, if she still lives &mdash; is not simple, even for a seasoned group of adventurers. If they can succeed in their mission, though, they will win the gravin&rsquo;s undying gratitude &mdash; and her determination to keep them, and their dangerous knowledge, close to her for the rest of their lives.</p>\n<h3>The Cultists</h3>\n<p>The followers of Slaanesh include the young and foolish scions of some prominent families (you can choose which according to the needs of your campaign), and Gravin Maria-Ulrike is determined to detain and identify them all &mdash; without allowing word to reach the Witch Hunters (specifically the ever vigilant Matthias Hubkind, page 34, who may still be on her trail since Nuln). Those from allied houses will be gently but firmly shown the error of their ways, and their misdeeds covered up; those from rival houses will be turned into useful assets, providing social and political leverage against their families.</p>\n<p>A secondary objective &mdash; to the gravin, at least &mdash; will be to identify other branches of the cult that seduced the young nobles, and ensure two things: first, that its members are punished for compromising members of the nobility; and second, that they are left in no condition to name the young aristocrats and embarrass them or their families in the future.</p>\n<p>A group of mercenaries, with no formal ties to any noble house, make a conveniently deniable instrument for such a task. This could even make an interesting side adventure if your Players fancy playing different Characters for a while.</p>\n<p>If either Kavenner or Rechtshandler were involved with the summoning, the gravin is swift and brutal in her pronouncement: she wants them seized, burned, and buried. She then instructs her servants to erase any trace of evidence connecting her, or her cousin the Countess, to either of them.</p>\n<h3>The Gem</h3>\n<p>If Dowager-Duchess Clothilde of Telland survived the night, she will want her ruby back; if not, there will be widespread interest in tracing both the gem and the venerable lady&rsquo;s murderers. While Gravin Maria-Ulrike has no great personal stake in the wellbeing of the Countess or the whereabouts of the gem, there is prestige to be gained for her house if she &mdash; or rather, her agents &mdash; can resolve the situation.</p>\n<p>The taggee are heading down the Reik to Marienburg, intending to take ship for Ind as soon as possible &mdash; unless the Wraith or Glimbrin stole the gem first, in which case they are hot on the culprit&rsquo;s trail. Bringing a noble to trial for theft will be a tricky business, but if the Characters can lay convincing proof before the gravin, she will take the matter in hand. However, rather than having Graf Josef von Angendorf arrested, she will try to turn him into an unwilling accomplice, to be used under the threat of blackmail whenever the gravin needs to acquire an item under less than legal circumstances. If the Characters are instead trying to catch Glimbrin, they&rsquo;ll have their work cut out for them, as this is the Gnome&rsquo;s last caper before raiding his stash of stolen goods, then heading back to the Mirror Moors and his home in Glimdwarrow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Could an arrow cut it?&rsquo;, for example. When it&rsquo;s your Turn, you&rsquo;ll make your Move and take Action!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On your Turn you have a Move and an Action, you can take these in any order &mdash; it&rsquo;s presumed you are probably doing both at the same time, and you can freely describe them as one combined manoeuvre. You can also skip taking an Action or Move, though you won&rsquo;t get another opportunity until the next Round!</p>\n<p>Vivid descriptions of what you do will bring the Combat to life.

Use your Movement Characteristic as a guide to the ground you can cover, and the GM will let you know if the move will take more than one Turn. Reaching difficult places, perhaps by climbing or jumping, will also use your Action if you need to Test a Skill to get there (perhaps with a Climb or Athletics Test).</p>\n<p>If you are not already fighting someone, you can also use your Move to Charge into close combat, gaining +1 Advantage. For more on this, and for a detailed breakdown of movement speeds, leaping distances, and more, see @JournalEntry[Moving During Combat].</p>\n<h4>Action</h4>\n<p>In combat, your Action is used to do something. Whether that&rsquo;s swing a sword at a Mutant, jump from rooftop to rooftop, or take a moment to gauge the situation, that&rsquo;s up to you. Your Action is only limited by your imagination, the physical constraints of the fight location and the capabilities of your Character.</p>\n<p>Describe what you want your Character to do. The GM will then tell you if you need to make a Test to succeed at your planned Action. The results will then be narrated by you and the GM, ending your Action.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><strong>Example</strong>:&nbsp;</span>Molli looks on nervously from behind a barrel as Salundra is beset by the flying fists of three pub brawlers keen to put the young captain in her place. On her Turn, Molli&rsquo;s player asks if the pub has an upper floor. The GM confirms it does, and that it has a balcony overlooking the fight. Smiling, the player declares Molli will sprint upstairs and push a table down on the fight to help break it up using both her Move and Action. Given the upper floor isn&rsquo;t far away, the GM decides Molli can get there in a single Round but pushing the small table there will take a little effort.</p>\n<p>The GM calls for an&nbsp;<strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong>&nbsp;Test to heft the table over the balcony. Molli&rsquo;s Athletics is 34, so she needs to roll 54 or under. She rolls 21, for +3 SL, and the table flies! Molli shouts out as the table tips: &lsquo;Stop fighting!&rsquo; The GM states all combatants below must perform an&nbsp;<strong>Opposed Dodge</strong>&nbsp;Test against the +3 SL or be hit by the table. Unfortunately, only Salundra fails this, and the table lands squarely on her head&hellip;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Free Actions</h4>\n<p>Some things you&rsquo;ll want your Character to do won&rsquo;t count as your Action for the round &mdash; such as shouting a warning,&nbsp; drawing your weapon, or drinking a potion. It&rsquo;s the GM&rsquo;s decision on what takes up your Action, and what you can do in a Round. A good general guide is that if an act requires you to make a Test, it is an Action rather than a Free Action.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Options: On The Defense</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">What if you want to prepare to dodge or parry incoming blows, to hold a defensive position in a doorway, or use Language (Magick) to deploy an array of dispels?

In a sense, it&rsquo;s one of the most important things about a Character, because it tells us why they do what they do! In light of that monumental importance, we&rsquo;ve compiled a few tools to help GMs and Players alike in choosing and managing their Motivations.</p>\n<h3>Choosing Motivations</h3>\n<p>Choosing Motivations can seem tricky &mdash; after all, they&rsquo;re so important! But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a difficult process, especially if you follow these tips, and review the example Motivations presentated below.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth stressing that the most interesting Characters are those whose Motivations run contrary to what you would normally expect. Everyone expects a mercenary to care about &lsquo;Wealth&rsquo;, but what if they actually care about &lsquo;Duty&rsquo; to their family, and are sending all their money back home? Everyone expects a Scholar to care about &lsquo;Knowledge&rsquo;, but what if they are motivated more by &lsquo;Romance&rsquo; than anything else? A good rule of thumb when it comes to writing is to throw out your first idea because it&rsquo;s the obvious one, and the same often applies to a Character&rsquo;s Motivation.</p>\n<p>Also, keep in mind that your Motivation isn&rsquo;t locked in stone, it can change whenever you need it to.</p>\n<h3>Changing Motivations</h3>\n<p>A Character&rsquo;s Motivations are sure to change throughout the course of their adventuring life, and Players and GMs should always be vigilant for when this occurs. Whilst Motivation can be changed at the beginning of every session, it&rsquo;s a good idea to save these changes for the following moments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you find yourself having not played to your Character&rsquo;s Motivation in a few sessions</li>\n<li>When you change Career</li>\n<li>When you complete an Ambition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Players should use these events to express how their Character has changed, and are encouraged to show off their new Motivation in the coming session. You should award an additional Resolve Point if this change is roleplayed in a believable and dramatic fashion!</p>\n<h3>The 'Check-In'</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, during an intense scene or Combat, it&rsquo;s difficult to keep track of Motivations, and whether or not they trigger @JournalEntry[Fate and Resilience]{Resolve}. If you&rsquo;re finding your group forgets about Motivation often, or if you&rsquo;d rather not worry about it during a session, try using a Check-In instead.</p>\n<p>A Check-In occurs at the same time as handing out XP, and involves everyone going around the table and announcing their Motivation. Next, everyone considers the session they&rsquo;ve just played, and decides if that Character expressed their Motivation &lsquo;not at all&rsquo;, &lsquo;a bit&rsquo; or &lsquo;a lot&rsquo;. Everyone should get a say, and should take this opportunity to point out interesting and humorous moments during the session, but ultimately the Player and the GM together have the final say over how much the Motivation was expressed. This is purely subjective, so go more along how it felt, rather than a point-for-point retelling of the session.</p>\n<p>If a Character expressed their Motivation &lsquo;not at all&rsquo;, they regain no Resolve. If they expressed it &lsquo;a bit&rsquo;, they regain 1 Resolve Point, or 2 Resolve for &lsquo;a lot&rsquo;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Ruinous Motivations</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some Motivations are, themselves, the pathways of the damned. Whilst some are clearly corrupting like &lsquo;Debauchery&rsquo; or &lsquo;Violence&rsquo;, even seemingly innocent Motivations can and do stoke the fire of Chaos within a Character. &lsquo;Change&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hope&rsquo; are admirable Motivations, though they do undeniably play into the machinations of Tzeentch and Nurgle respectively.</em></p>\n<p><em>You may offer a Player an additional Resolve Point for following the Character&rsquo;s Motivation in exchange for a Corruption Point if the action appears to aid one or more of the Ruinous Powers. This choice is always the Player&rsquo;s to make.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Example Motivations</h3>\n<p>The following is a list of example Motivations accompanied by situations which might earn them Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Authority</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a clear chain of command, and thrive when there are orders to be followed &mdash; whether you&rsquo;re giving them, or taking them. Most people who favour such structure either long for the day when they themselves are able to pass commands down the chain to their lessers, or believe themselves to be merely a cog in a greater machine. Following orders or listening to, and assisting, the authorities garners Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Change</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need for change, for a better or brighter future. You are discontent with the status quo, and any action you take that shifts this &mdash; whether positively or negatively &mdash; is better than what we have now, at least. Anything you do that is counter to the norm feeds into this Motivation.</p>\n<h4>Charity</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to help people. Whilst many give to charity in pursuit of power, status, or out of boredom, you do it for its own sake. Charity, in your eyes, is its own reward. Helping the less fortunate, and giving what you can, regenerates your Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Control</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a desire to control the world around you. Perhaps you suffer from anxiety, or were raised in a situation where you were the centre of attention &mdash; whatever the reason, you thrive when there are no surprises. You regain Resolve when you seek to bend the world around you to your will.</p>\n<h4>Debauchery</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by forbidden delights. Either the fact that they are forbidden is tantilising to you, or you&rsquo;ve lost sight of healthy appetites long ago, you regain Resolve when you give into your obscene desires.</p>\n<h4>Envy</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to possess that which others have. It could be anything &mdash; wealth, romance, land, power &mdash; but you desire these things because someone else has them, not for their own merit. When you covet and take from others, you are sure to regenerate Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Faith (God)</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a deep faith in your patron God of choice, and allow the strictures of such to dictate your life. Choose a God to go along with this Motivation, and regain Resolve whenever you go out of your way to follow that God&rsquo;s strictures, or protect the honour and sanctity of their worship. A list of Gods and their strictures can be found in @JournalEntry[The Gods] Fame</p>\n<p>You are motivated by being known. You want your name to be on everyone&rsquo;s lips, to be well regarded, and to be remembered. When you perform actions in public, or work to spread word of your deeds (real or imaginary), you recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Freedom</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by being untethered and allowed to go where you please. Often freed bondsmen, enslaved individuals, or the children of overly oppressive parents burn with this Motivation. You recover Resolve when you choose your own path in the face of authority.</p>\n<h4>Glory</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to achieve great things. You likely have one burning desire &mdash; perhaps your Long Term Ambition &mdash; which, whenever you work towards it, you recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Gluttony</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by an unnatural appetite for something specific, and wish to indulge that vice at all times. When you pursue or partake of your vice, you feed your Motivation and regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Hope</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a hope that things can get better. In the Old World, this is a futile Motivation, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop thousands of souls trudging towards it every day. When you perform actions that seem doomed to fail, but you do them anyway because you believe it might work out, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Infamy</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a desire to be remembered and feared. Like fame, infamy is about developing a personal story that will always be bigger than the person you were, but it differs in that you don&rsquo;t want to be remembered kindly. You want to forever serve as a lesson to someone or against something, and whenever you strike fear, or encourage rumours about yourself, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Justice</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to see justice done. Whether it&rsquo;s a belief that justice holds together society, or a perverse fascination with punishment, you see enacting the law of the Gods &mdash; though not necessarily the law of the land &mdash; as paramount. Whenever you aid or enact your own justice, regenerate Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Knowledge</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the search for knowledge itself. You don&rsquo;t necessarily want to do anything with that knowledge, but the pursuit is what&rsquo;s important to you. When you learn something new, or encourage the spread of knowledge, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Love</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a strong bond of love with someone. Love is often irrational, and causes people to act in ways which deprioritise their own safety or happiness, and doing so is a sure way of earning Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Obligation</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by an obligation you hold &mdash; to family, friends, an organisation, and so on. You likely have a role to play in relation to this obligation, and fulfilling that role is of paramount importance to you. Whenever you perform actions that fulfill that role, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Order</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by structure and order. You thrive when there is a set framework to operate inside of, and rules to follow. You regain Resolve when you follow the rules &mdash; especially to your detriment &mdash; and help enforce them.</p>\n<h4>Patriotism</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by love of country. This pride can become toxic &mdash; used as a pathetic crutch to cover for your own failings &mdash; or could stem from true pride in the history of your people &mdash; whether deserved or doctored. You recover Resolve by putting your nation first, and by following the dictates of your rulers &mdash; rational or otherwise.</p>\n<h4>Perfection</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need to be perfect. Regardless of what the focus is, you need to be the perfect example of it, a painter, a poet, a cook, whatever. This Motivation exists beyond any tangible benefits of that perfection or profession, and often strays into a truly unhealthy mindset, for perfection is ultimately impossible. Whenever you work towards that perfection, regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Pleasure</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the pursuit of pleasure, fine food, fine wine, fine friends, and so forth. You seek to get the most out of life, and feel fulfilled when in good, comfortable, pleasurable company. You regain Resolve whenever you take a little extra effort to bring a little extra pleasure into your life.</p>\n<h4>Power</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a quest for power. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what power, and over whom, but you feel safer and more whole when the power of any situation is in your hands. This may translate into literal power &mdash; the search for arcane potency or martial excellence &mdash; but not necessarily. You just have to exert and extend your reach to recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Respect</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the respect of your peers. It&rsquo;s not necessarily about being the best &mdash; the best swordsman, the best incantor, the best alchemist &mdash; but you need your peers to heed what you say, and admire your works. You may see yourself as&nbsp;</p>\n<p>first among equals, or merely rising to the level of your heroes, but either way, when you increase or maintain your standing, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Revenge</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by a need for revenge. Perhaps someone killed your father and they must prepare to die, or someone ruined your family&rsquo;s business and now you seek to destroy theirs. Whatever the source of your ire, you seek to reenact it on those who hurt you. Whenever you work towards or fulfill your revenge, recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Ruin</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the ruination of the world around you. You may have a target in mind, a specific nation, family, or organisation, or merely existence itself. Whenever you work to bring your foes to their knees and have them crushed under your boot, you regenerate Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Servitude</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by your service to another. Servitude is a rare Motivation, because it relies on the mind placing the needs of another above one&rsquo;s own, and trusting in the benevolence of that master. When you act at the behest of those you serve, you recover Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Survival</h4>\n<p>You are motivated first and foremost by your own survival, and will do what you can to protect yourself. This Motivation extends to protecting your livelihood, if it comes under existential threat &mdash; a hunter defending their hunting grounds from poachers, or an urchin protecting their streets from invading troops. In any situation where you take an active hand to maintain your survival, you regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Unity</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by uniting others towards a common goal. Whether this stems from dreams of Empire, Shallyan pacifism, or a desire to mend an old feud, you regain Resolve when you act to bring others together.</p>\n<h4>Wealth</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by the clink of coins. Whilst almost everyone is motivated in some way by money in the Old World, you desire money for its own sake. You may even be loath to spend it once it is yours. Wealth, for you, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean power or privilege, but it represents a dependable source of strength for yourself. Whenever you seek out wealth and hoard it, regain Resolve.</p>\n<h4>Violence</h4>\n<p>You are motivated by violence, and love the thrill of battle. You might be addicted to the adrenaline, or you&rsquo;re fascinated by the craft of battle. Whatever the case, whenever you engage in violent acts for their own purpose, regenerate Resolve.</p>","_id":"Xxx9eQIn30W3asSb"}

{"_id":"Y8gsUy36YNqlyRWX","name":"Fate and Resilience","permission":{"default":2,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"KBFMpqeeMFWhdpSI","sort":400001,"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Rules"}},"content":"<p>Whether it’s guts, luck or the favour of the gods, there is something special about you. Fate and Resilience represent the different ways you stand out from the masses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Characters gain their starting Fate and Resilience in Character Generation (see page 34). Both are related to pools of points: Fate to Fortune, Resilience to Resolve. You may spend your points to achieve small benefits, and these pools will refill over the course of play. You spend your Fate or Resilience points for a significant benefit during play but this permanently reduces them and also reduces the associated pool of Fortune or Resolve points. While Fate and Resilience points may be regained, this occurs only rarely, so spend them carefully.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although they are very rare and normally reserved for PCs, the GM may also want to apply Fate and Resilience to noteworthy NPCs, like a necromantic nemesis, a local luminary of significance, or a recurring cult leader.</p>\n<h3>Fate and Fortune</h3>\n<p>Player characters have destiny. While their ultimate future is a mystery and there is no guarantee it will be glorious, heroic, or even pleasant, they are seemingly fated for something important.</p>\n<p>To represent this, you begin play with a number of Fate Points. Fate points mark you out from the rest of the denizens of the Old World. They allow you to survive against impossible odds and prevail where ordinary folk fail.</p>\n<p>Fate is directly related to your Fortune points. Fortune points are spent to receive minor bonuses, including the ability to reroll failed Tests or gain an edge as luck favours you, and the number you have will likely fluctuate wildly during play. Fate determines how many Fortune points you can have, and be permanently spent in the direst of circumstances to avoid death.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Spending Fortune</h4>\n<p>You may spend a Fortune point from your pool to turn luck to your advantage: hitting with that difficult crossbow shot when you would have otherwise missed; or perhaps an opponent slips, granting you a chance to land a blow. Your three options are:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Reroll a failed Test</li>\n<li>Add +1 SL to a Test after it is rolled</li>\n<li>At the start of the Round, choose when to act in that Round disregarding Initiative order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Spending Fate&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>You may spend a permanent Fate point to avoid death and survive even the most unlikely situations. When you do this, choose one of the following two options:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><strong>Die Another Day</strong>: Instead of dying, your character is knocked out, left for dead, swept away by a river, or otherwise taken out of action; your character will survive, no matter the fatal incident's circumstances, but takes no further part in the current encounter.</li>\n<li><strong>How Did That Miss?</strong>: Your character completely avoids the incoming damage by some extraordinary fluke, such as slipping just as a blow is about to connect, a weapon mysteriously jamming, or an unexpected source of light blinding an opponent; your character can continue on without penalty, but has no guarantee of survival in later rounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first option takes you out of play, but allows you to fight another day, for all your character may be battered, bloody, bruised, and perhaps even captured in the process! The second option allows you to continue fighting side-by-side with your companions, but leaves you in significant danger, meaning you may need to spend more Fate points in later Rounds to ensure survival. Each option has advantages and disadvantages, depending upon the context of the situation, and it is up to you to decide which is the best choice to take.</p>\n<p>The GM describes how you survive a given situation after spending a Fate rating point.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Regaining Fate and Fortune</h4>\n<p>You regain all Fortune points at the start of every gaming session, up to the maximum of your current Fate. In addition, certain in-game encounters may also replenish (or remove!) Fortune points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your GM may grant you a Fate point for an act of extreme heroism, bravery, or significance. Normally this only happens at the successful end of an important adventure, so make sure to spend them carefully as they rarely replenish.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>Resilience and Resolve</h3>\n<p>While Fate points represent your destiny, perhaps chosen by some distant, uncaring deity, Resilience is an indication of your personal drive and determination to endure, and overcome, no matter the obstacles you face.</p>\n<p>Like Fate, Resilience is directly linked to a pool of points, this time called Resolve. Resolve points are spent to push through minor obstacles, such as ignoring the negative effects of critical wounds for a Round or removing Conditions. Resilience determines your upper limit of Resolve points and can be permanently spent to push yourself through seemingly impossible situations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Spending Resolve</h4>\n<p>You may spend a Resolve point to draw upon your inner reserves: maybe confronting a terrifying Ogre without flinching; or ignoring the effects of even the most powerful of blows. Your choices are:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Become immune to Psychology&nbsp;until the end of the next Round.</li>\n<li>Ignore all modifiers from all Critical Wounds until the beginning of the next Round</li>\n<li>Remove one Condition; if you removed the @Condition[Prone] Condition, regain 1 Wound as you surge to your feet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Spending Resilience</h4>\n<p>You may also choose to spend Resilience point to defy the corruption curling&nbsp; within, or to succeed where it would seem certain you should fail. Here, you have the following two options:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><strong>I Deny You!</strong>: You may choose not to develop a rolled mutation. Because you do not mutate, you do not lose any Corruption Points.</li>\n<li><strong>I Will Not Fail!</strong>: Rather than roll the result of a Test, you can choose the number instead, allowing you to succeed in even the direst situations. In an Opposed Test, you always win by at least 1 SL. You can even choose to do this on a Test already failed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Saving permanent Resilience to rebuff the influence of Chaos is wise, but it does not remove your Corruption points, meaning mutation is still perilously close. By comparison, using permanent Resilience to succeed in any Test can allow you to land a blow on an otherwise impossible-to-hit target, create an artefact that astounds all who see it with a Trade skill, or even perfectly manifest a spell you would normally find impossible to cast.</p>\n<p>When you spend a Resilience point, take time to describe the enormous feat of will your character has undertaken, and how this manifests in play.</p>\n<h4>Regaining Resilience and Resolve</h4>\n<p>Resolve is regained whenever you act according to your Motivation. During play, whenever you feel you have done this, you may ask the GM if you can recover one or more Resolve points.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: Griselda is a nun with the Motivation ‘Sigmar’. While her allies gossip in a tavern seeking clues, she elects to visit the local temple to make a donation and offer prayers to her deity. As this fits her Motivation, her GM decides to replenish one of her Resolve points but tells Griselda’s player that she will need to pray and donate in a different temple to receive that benefit again this week.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The GM may grant a Resilience point for an act of extreme importance to your Motivation, permanently nourishing your soul, but such an event will be very rare.</p>\n<p>Example: After many adventures, Griselda finally finances a new temple to Sigmar in her home village of Velten not far from Nuln. The GM recognises the importance of this to Griselda’s faith and grants her a permanent Resilience point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: A bandit leader is on the rampage, having built up 10 Advantage while evading the party’s blows. Things are about to get messy! Salundra decides to attack the bandit, but loses the Opposed Test by 7 SL, which is going to hurt a lot. So, she spends a permanent Resilience point to invoke ‘I Will Not Fail’. This means she automatically wins the Opposed Test by +1 SL. She also chooses the result of the roll to be 11, causing a Critical. The bandit leader will take some Wounds and a Critical Wound. More importantly, his rampage comes to an end as he also loses all 10 Advantage as the fight turns in the heroes favour.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>"}

Because Sigmar was once the emperor, his worship is inextricably interwoven with politics, and three of the cult’s highest-ranking members are directly involved with electing new emperors. According to legend, 2,500 years ago Sigmar’s birth was heralded by a twin-tailed comet, and he was born the first son of the chief of the Unberogen tribe. When older, he received the magical warhammer Ghal-maraz (‘Skull-splitter’) as a gift from the Dwarf king Kurgan Ironbeard for saving his life from Greenskins. Sigmar later allied with the Dwarfs and their combined forces defeated the Greenskins. He was then crowned as the first emperor of the Human tribes he’d united. After fifty years of extraordinary rule, Sigmar mysteriously vanished, only to later ascend to divinity, crowned as a god by Ulric, Sigmar’s patron in life.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Most folk of the Empire pay at least lip-service to their patron deity. In the most devout provinces, like Reikland, Sigmar worship is an unquestioned part of daily life. Folk attend weekly ‘throngs’ where the lessons of Sigmar are preached. Many also attend temple to train as local militia, confess sins and purify the soul, or receive advice on how to be more like the God-King of old.&nbsp; Sigmar’s cult is comprised of an uncounted number of different orders. The largest is the Order of the Torch: Sigmar’s priests who lead their local communities. Other orders of importance include: the Order of the Cleansing Flame, comprised of inquisitors and witch hunters; the Order of the Silver Hammer, which includes warrior priests and yet more witch hunters; and the Order of the Anvil, a monastic order concerned with preserving Sigmar’s deeds and laws. The cult also has many templar orders. The most famous are the proud Knights of Sigmar’s Blood, the fanatical Knights of the Fiery Heart, and the militaristic Knights Griffon. Given the cult is so large, there are many different uniforms, vestments, and robes worn, all of which have different colours, cuts, and accessories according to local tradition and requirement.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Every city, town, and village in the Empire has at least one temple to Sigmar. The Grand Cathedral in Altdorf is staffed by hundreds of priests and lay workers, and guarded by at least two orders of templars; at the other end of the scale, a village chapel may be visited just once every week by a travelling priest, who serves the needs of several small settlements.&nbsp; Shrines can be found in most homes, and wayshrines dot every major highway, mostly marked with hammers or comets.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Sigmarite cultists may be ordered to destroy a cell of Chaos-worshippers, or expose a corrupt official who is secretly in league with the Ruinous Powers or a foreign power. It is also common to be tasked with building, or rebuilding, local communities to better promote unity and strength in the Empire.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><em>Strictures</em></strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Obey your orders.</em></li>\n<li><em>Aid Dwarf-folk, never do them harm.</em></li>\n<li><em>Promote the unity of the Empire.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bear true allegiance to the imperial throne.</em></li>\n<li><em>Root out Greenskins, Chaos worshippers, and foul witches without mercy.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Blessing of Hardiness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.KSDrXcieyRc37YI7]{Blessing of Might}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.2WN0muIB2BFd4kBO]{Blessing of Righteousness}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Dk0zjtcANtahntHx]{Beacon of Righteous Virtue}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Ffm7xIlRUWyacvKU]{Heed Not the Witch}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.WgZx3xma6vYGz17e]{Sigmar's Fiery Hammer}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.5fVTY8TSua3trOW8]{Soulfire}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.rjkMzFwN1trbSLL8]{Twin-tailed Comet}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.I8YPP2uRmUKyHEq2]{Vanquish the Unrighteous}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/sigmar.webp"}

In fact he will attempt a pained chumminess with Tarwin should the two of them meet. Mahler is simply too intimidated by the Fish to even want to see justice done here, and instead of the beating he will return again to the subject of the lost Mootland leaf.</p>"}

Brigands, mutants, and beasts lurk in the shadows, an ever-present threat, perhaps joined by those specifically out to thwart the Players’ actions. Some parts of the Empire have been corrupted by magic, Chaos, Necromancy, or worse, and can easily consume the unwary traveller. Even the weather poses a threat!</p>\n<p>It’s up to you how you want to represent the dangers of travel in your game. Sometimes you’ll just want to get on with the adventure and deal with journeys with a simple description of how long the journey was, and the key points along the way. Most journeys will either be by road or by river, with road the more dangerous, and cheaper, option.</p>\n<h4>Travel by Road</h4>\n<p>The roads of the Reikland are often crude but reliable. The routes between major cities are relatively safe and well-maintained. However, far-flung routes can be little more than muddy tracks. Regardless of the quality, all roads need to be maintained, so most are tolled.</p>\n<p>There is an extensive network of coach routes throughout the province. The busiest routes have coaches running several times per day. The many Coaching Houses of the Reikland are in fierce competition, so the prices are often reasonable and reliability is good. The Four Seasons is the biggest coach company, and is represented along all the major routes.</p>\n<p>Roadside inns are often placed at the convenience of the Coaching Houses. Therefore, journeying by foot, especially away from the major routes, runs the risk of not reaching a safe place to rest before nightfall.</p>\n<h4>Travel by River</h4>\n<p>River journeys are often straightforward and perhaps even relaxing. However, this relies on finding a boat going to and from convenient locations. Dedicated passenger barges only travel between the major towns and cities, but can be bribed or persuaded to drop people off along the way. Getting to more obscure locations usually requires hitching a ride with a cargo boat, which can be difficult for large parties.</p>\n<h4>Travel Prices</h4>\n<p>The prices listed in Travel Costs do not include meals, lodging, or fodder, although coaches and passenger boats usually charge for the whole package for longer journeys. Package prices can be worked out by combining travel with food and boarding prices. On some ferries, lodging is not required, as passengers sleep on the vessel, either on deck or in a private cabin.</p>\n<p>Cargo barge travel-costs should be individually haggled with barge masters. Often, such passage can be secured for a greatly reduced price, or even for free, if the passenger is willing to work and they know what they’re doing.</p>\n<p>High class travel is available and de rigueur among the nobility, and can cost many times the listed price, typically ten times or more. Opulent passenger vessels ply between the great cities of the Empire, like the famous Emperor Luitpold plying the River Talebec between Altdorf and Talabheim.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Travel Costs</span></h3>\n<p><em>All the costs listed here are per mile travelled, and are loose guides only.

So, if a party’s slowest Movement was 3, it would travel at approximately 3 miles per hour.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Taking into account rests, necessary stops, and a typical topography, a party can travel the equivalent of 6 hours a day without requiring Endurance Tests. If travelling faster or farther, give a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition to those failing this Test, with extra Fatigue if Encumbered.</p>\n<p>Barge speed can increase or decrease by up to 30% if going downstream or upstream, as you determine is appropriate.</p>\n<h4>Travel Events</h4>\n<p>Whether detailing daily travel or simply choosing to allow the party to pay an appropriate fee and then arrive at their chosen destination, every now and again it’s good to throw in some travel events. It’s an opportunity to show off a different aspect of the Old World, or to give a change of pace to the adventure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An intrigue-focused game can sometimes do with a clearly defined ‘goodies vs. baddies’ Beastmen attack. A tense, bleak session can benefit from a night’s entertainment sharing camp with a travelling circus. Further, you can work these encounters into your ongoing narrative if you wish.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finding the burned-out caravans of the circus later in the journey is a poignant way of making the antagonists’ actions personal. Travel events are also great for foreshadowing events to come, or reinforcing the themes of an adventure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is up to you how much of an issue you want these travel events to be for your players. Some could simply consist of a brief description, while others could form the basis of an entire session of play. Some GMs prefer to roll [[/gmr 1d10]] per day of travel and have an event occur on the roll of an 8 (signifying the 8-pointed symbol of Chaos — something unexpected and random has occurred), others like a single event for each journey of a day or more. This is left for you to determine, though if you are playing a printed adventure by <strong>Cubicle 7</strong> that includes a journey, suggested events and travel times will be included. So, @Table[travel] can be used as you prefer, and presumes a single event for the journey travelled.</p>\n<p>You might like to give Players the opportunity to avoid nasty events with a successful Perception Test, or Outdoor Survival, or whatever other Test makes sense at the time. If they are travelling in paid-for transportation, you might decide that gives them help in overcoming any adversities.&nbsp;</p>"}

After all, it’s hard to find a harpsichord in a five-house hamlet, but not so hard in the shops and markets of imperial capital, Altdorf.</p>\n<p>The following rules for buying and selling are all optional. The GM may prefer to roleplay every visit to each market, hawker, or shop, meaning Tests for Availability are unrequired as the GM simply states what is or isn’t purchasable. Equally, the GM may prefer you to simply check the trapping lists, roll for Availability and, if the Test succeeds, spend the coin on whatever you want. Possibly without even Haggling!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Tracking Money</em></h3>\n<p><em>Where some groups like to track every penny closely, perhaps even using chits or fantasy coins to represent in-game coins, others prefer to ignore all fiscal book-keeping. The game rules assume you are counting every coin, but if you wish to simplify money, you can do so using your Status. If an item costs less than your Status level — so if you have a Status of Silver 2, any item costing 2 silver shillings or less — you are assumed to be able to buy as much as needed of that item. Beyond that, you can buy a maximum of one item a day that costs more with a Haggle Test, with the difficulty set by the GM according to the cost of the item and the local markets.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Availability</h3>\n<p>All Trappings have an Availability, either Common, Scarce, Rare, or Exotic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Common items are found in almost every corner of the Empire and are always assumed to be readily available.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Scarce and Rare items are less common, and you need to pass an Availability Test to find any locally in stock; the chance of passing the Test depends upon the settlement size.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Exotic items are super rare, and only available if the GM says so, or if you commission the item from an appropriate artisan (perhaps with a @JournalEntry[Commission] Endeavour), or make it yourself (perhaps with a @JournalEntry[Crafting] Endeavour.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>Once you know an item's availability, you can use the `/avail` command to test if it's in stock. For example, `/avail Village Rare`. Otherwise, the item's availability can be tested by posting the item to chat.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you fail an Availability Test for Scarce or Rare items, you can either reroll when you arrive at a new settlement or you can try again next week if the settlement is Town-size or larger.</p>\n<p>If an item is in stock, it’s up to the GM to determine how many are available. As a general rule-of-thumb, villages have a single item in stock, towns have [[/r 1d10]] items, and cities have as many as the GM deems appropriate. These quantities are generally doubled for Common items, and halved for Rare ones (rounding up).</p>\n<h3>Bargaining and Trading</h3>\n<p>People of the Empire love a good bargain, and crowds of eager shoppers fill town squares every day looking for the best deals. When buying goods, there are two primary Skills to Test: Evaluate and Haggle.</p>\n<p>Evaluate is used by consumers to identify the quality of an item. Similarly, the vendor can use Evaluate to appraise coins for their exchange value, or spot counterfeits. Anyone can also use Evaluate to estimate the prices of Rare or Exotic items to within +/-10%.</p>\n<p>Haggle is used routinely by consumers and vendors alike, typically with Opposed Tests. Haggling is expected and most prices are marked up slightly to account for this. Winning a Haggle Test reduces the price by 10% (or possibly up to 20% with an Astounding Success (6+) or with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.epPBu7x6BRWp2PHG]{Dealmaker} Talent). Failing a Haggle contest badly usually means the vendor distrusts your coinage.</p>\n<h4>Roleplaying Shopping Trips</h4>\n<p>Trips to the market for routine purchases don’t need to be roleplayed in detail. The GM might prefer you browse the equipment lists and check for Availability yourself. Major purchases that involve item Craftsmanship, or require extra Haggling, can be fun to roleplay in-character. In certain scenarios, shopkeepers are important NPCs with distinct personalities or story roles, so it’s always worth interacting with them. Consider the following when roleplaying shopping:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The GM may overrule Availability as dictated by local details. For example, basic rowboats are automatically available if the adventure is located in a fishing village that features a renowned boat-builder.</li>\n<li>Availability percentages can be increased by +10% or +20%if a character is especially diligent, belongs to a relevant career such as Merchant or Fence, or spends an entire day shopping and making Gossip Tests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Selling</h3>\n<p>Selling your trappings during desperate times, or simply offloading loot, is handled in exactly the same fashion as Buying, but this time you’ll be making money, not spending it. So, you first check for Availability of a buyer in the same fashion as checking for stock. You then bargain and trade, with Evaluate Tests and Haggle Tests as the GM prefers, and finally you set a price. Typically, the base cost when selling is half the item’s listed price, meaning, when selling second-hand, you usually make between a quarter to half an item’s worth after Haggling.</p>\n<p>If you have a Career like fence or merchant, and you put time into Gossip Tests and wandering the local town, you might find someone willing to pay up to 80% of the item’s listed value, though that is left in the hands of the GM.</p>\n<h4>Lowering the Price</h4>\n<p>If you can’t find a buyer, you can try lowering the price. Each time you half the money you are willing to accept, the Availability of a buyer increases by one step.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Corporal Mauser has fled his State Army regiment with a Hochland Longrifle he stole, and is keen to sell. As it’s an Exotic item, there are no immediate buyers he can find on the street. The GM determines the base price Mauser can expect is half the weapon’s value (so 50GC, half of the 100GC it’s worth), so Mauser decides to drop the price by half two times, saying he will accept 12GC 10/–, which increases the Availability of a Buyer two steps from Exotic to Scarce.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Bartering</h3>\n<p>Rural and mercantile commerce often involves trading one commodity for another without exchanging money. To resolve bartering of this type, compare the Availability of the items being traded against those being acquired. The barter ratio indicates how many ‘units’ must be traded, and how many ‘units’ of the other commodity are acquired. ‘Units’ are defined by checking the equipment list prices of both items and grouping them into packages of roughly equivalent value.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Bartering Ratios</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 460px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Traded Items</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">Scare</td>\n<td style=\"width: 79px; text-align: center;\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"width: 88px; text-align: center;\">Exotic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99px; text-align: center;\">Common</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">2:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 79px; text-align: center;\">4:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 88px; text-align: center;\">8:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99px; text-align: center;\">Scarce</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 79px; text-align: center;\">2:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 88px; text-align: center;\">4:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99px; text-align: center;\">Rare</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 79px; text-align: center;\">1:1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 88px; text-align: center;\">2:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 99px; text-align: center;\">Exotic</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89px; text-align: center;\">1:4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 79px; text-align: center;\">1:2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 88px; text-align: center;\">1:1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","_id":"cGM170eBv0xxR1aU"}

In such situations, here are two approaches that work well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert multiple Creatures into a Swarm. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.E2Es82TvBKa7CoDG]{Swarm} rules are purposefully vague enough that they can be applied to any group of combatants, whether they are actually swarming creatures like rats, or just a rabble of peasants. Two Swarms of Clanrats backed up by a single Rat Ogre is a much more manageable encounter than managing 20 Clanrats individually.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Use Group Advantage. When there are multiple combatants working together as a group, you may abstract their Advantage into one single pool of Advantage that they all use. When you do this, generate Advantage as normal, but with a limit of Initiative Bonus gained per Round of combat, regardless of the source. Additionally, whenever a member of the group would lose all of their Advantage, the group loses 2 instead, keeping the remainder.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: The Characters are fighting six Goblins, and the GM decides to use Group Advantage. The Goblins have an Initiative Bonus of 2, so can generate a maximum of 2 Advantage as a group per Round. On the first Round, three of the Goblins charge the Characters. Normally, each would generate 1 Advantage, but instead, they generate 3 Advantage for the group, which drops down to 2 given their Initiative Bonus. Any additional Advantage gained this Round by any of the Goblins won&rsquo;t be counted, but now they all benefit from a +20 to all relevant Tests. On the following Round, after gaining +2 more Advantage as a group, one of the Goblins is defeated in an Opposed Melee Test. Normally that Goblin would lose all of their Advantage, but because they are in a group, the group merely loses 2 Advantage, and retains the rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Removing Advantage</h3>\n<p>Whilst it&rsquo;s great when you have Advantage on your side, the tables can turn very quickly in WFRP, and before you know it, your opponents have built up deadly momentum. When overwhelming Advantage is accrued, it can seem impossible to overcome it. Here are three broad tips for removing Advantage.</p>\n<h4>Ranged Combatants</h4>\n<p>Ranged attacks cannot be Opposed unless performed at Point Blank Range or the target wields a shield, which means that no amount of Advantage will help a Character avoid losing Wounds! Make sure to place a few Creatures with ranged attacks in Combat scenes, and have them target the Characters who are building momentum the most. However, keep in mind that because ranged attacks aren&rsquo;t Opposed, successfully hitting an opponent with a ranged attack doesn&rsquo;t generate Advantage.</p>\n<h4>Passive Damage</h4>\n<p>Passive Damage is any source of Wound loss that isn&rsquo;t defended against, such as from the Ablaze, Bleeding, or Poisoned Conditions. Whilst some of these Conditions would involve Tests where Advantage would be relevant (such as dodging a thrown Incendiary, or parrying a poisoned blade) there are other ways to inflict these Conditions: employ the terrain, use Long Range, or target a Character&rsquo;s non-combat Skills, such as Endurance.</p>\n<h4>Retreat</h4>\n<p>Remember that a combatant loses 1 Advantage per Round if they failed to accrue any extra Advantage during that Round, or they end the Round outnumbered. Which means, if things are going badly for a combatant, they should try to put distance between themselves and their potential killer. Fleeing is one option, but it&rsquo;s not the only one. Consider the location where the Combat is taking place, and see if there are any ways to create barriers between combatants &mdash; throwing tables and chairs in the way, setting the ground on fire, and cutting the ropes suspending a bridge, are just a few examples.</p>\n<p>With a bit of creativity, and by thinking about the Scene where the Combat takes place, you and your Players can use Advantage as an inspiring feature of the system, rather than a snowballing problem to overcome. Remember that, whilst the Characters in the story wouldn&rsquo;t call it Advantage, they would be aware of momentum in a fight, and would try to be creative on the battlefield themselves to mitigate bad odds.</p>\n<h3>Creatures Without the Weapon Trait</h3>\n<p>Some Creatures such as the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.FmEDHnfAe2iIugpt]{Bog Octopus} in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay or the <em>Young Stirpike</em> in <strong>Ubersreik Adventures: If Looks Could Kill</strong> lack a Weapon Creature Trait, but have in its place the Bite, Tail, Tentacles, Vomit, and other such Traits that use Advantage as a cost. These Traits, without the Weapon Trait, mean that the Creature can&rsquo;t perform normal attacks, and must use their special attacks if they want to defeat an opponent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is entirely intentional, and allows these Creatures to be played in truly unorthodox ways, which encourages more dynamic Combat. You should consider the full range of methods for gaining @JournalEntry[Advantage] to aid in these situations. Charging, for example, is a good tactic to use when immediately followed by a Bite. Also remember that larger Creatures do not need to Disengage, so they may Charge, Bite, and move away freely.</p>","_id":"dl8tLDuq7t9jqeDI"}

While the majority reside in vast mountainside fortresses known as Holds, most larger towns and the capital of the Reikland also have Dwarf populations. Given their clannish nature, they tend to band together, forming enclaves or districts wherever they settle. Many of the Dwarfs living in Reikland are the descendants of those driven from Fallen Holds many centuries ago, but most still consider themselves as Dwarfs of the Grey Mountains, although some have never seen a hill, let alone a mountain.</p>\n<p>Dwarf culture respects skill in crafting &mdash; chiefly stonework, smithing and engineering &mdash; and Dwarf Holds are resplendent with impressive feats of artifice. They also covet gold and jewels, mining deep beneath the mountains in the pursuit of precious metals and gemstones. However, more than these material possessions, Dwarfs venerate their elders and ancestors, and have entire religions focussing upon important progenitors. Dwarfs cannot cast spells, although their runesmiths carve artefacts with intricate runes to harness magical power.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, their prowess as engineers is so impressive that some of their more ingenious clockwork or steam-powered devices are mistaken for magic by simpler folk.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dwarfs are squat with thick, muscular limbs and stout, broad torsos. Their features are heavy and their hair is thick. Length of hair is a mark of pride and status amongst Dwarfs, with elaborate braids and adornments demonstrating rank: to shave a Dwarf causes terrible shame. Indeed, honour is a&nbsp; fundamental aspect of their character. Given their long memories and proud natures, they bear grudges against those who have slighted or dishonoured them, gripping tight to their grievances for many years, even taking on the grudges borne by their ancestors, knowing their forebears will be watching over them, nursing their bitterness long after death.

However, in the sun-drenched south, Myrmidia is much more than this: she acts as the patron deity of both the Estalian Kingdoms and the Tilean City States, and is fanatically worshipped in both realms. Because of this, her cult is the largest in the Old World, for all it has a limited presence in the Empire. She is commonly portrayed as a tall, muscular, young woman armed and equipped in archaic, southern stylings. She is known for her calm, honourable approach to all matters, and her clerics do what they can to emulate this.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Myrmidia grants generals the insight to win battles with minimal losses, and soldiers the skill-at-arms to defeat enemies quickly and without significant losses. Because of this, her cult is steadily growing among the armies and garrisons of the Empire, especially in the Reikland, Averland, and Wissenland. In the Empire, the cult has three orders of significance. The Order of the Eagle tends to the temples and their surrounding communities, and is led from Nuln by the ‘Eagle of the North’, the most powerful Myrmidian north of the Vaults. The templar Order of the Righteous Spear has a chapterhouse attached to each of these temples, each commanded by the local high priest. A second templar order, the Order of the Blazing Sun, is the oldest Myrmidian order in the Empire, and works independently of the Order of the Eagle.</p>\n<p>Myrmidia’s clerics in the Empire normally wear blue cowls over white robes with red edging, with her symbol either sewn onto the left breast or worn as a cloak-clasp.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Most of Myrmidia’s holy sites are found in Estalia and Tilea, and are associated with the goddess’s campaigns across those realms when she manifested as a mortal over two-thousand years ago. In the Empire, the goddess has much less of a presence, with temples only in major towns and cities, and only a single monastic order cloistered in the Monastery of the Black Maiden in Wissenland. Temples to Myrmidia tend to follow the architectural styles of Tilea and Estalia, with domed roofs covering square or&nbsp;rectangular halls. Their exteriors are often carved with low reliefs showing battle scenes or tableaux of weapons and shields. Shrines may take the form of miniature temples, statues of the goddess, or free-standing sculptures of stacked weapons, shields, and armour. Myrmidia’s holy sites are also known for their scandalous depictions of the goddess and her saints, who are often presented wearing little more than scarves about their waists, which many Sigmarites find completely unacceptable.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances from Myrmidia are usually military in nature. A cultist may be ordered to defeat an enemy champion in single combat, or to train a group of peasants and lead them in the defence of their village. Protecting pilgrimage routes to sites of importance to Myrmidia are also not uncommon.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>Strictures</strong></em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Act with honour and dignity in all matters.</em></li>\n<li><em>Respect prisoners of war, and never kill an enemy who surrenders</em></li>\n<li><em>Show no mercy to the unrepentant enemies of Humanity.</em></li>\n<li><em>Obey all honourable orders.</em></li>\n<li><em>Preserve the weak from the horrors of war.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iIfYOlNrLb0uiV8c]{Blessing of Fortune}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.2WN0muIB2BFd4kBO]{Blessing of Righteousness}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Q91bWCEn0gt33fGT]{Blazing Sun}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.7KUKKbXBv8MbyEHt]{Eagle's Eye}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.nyZNUwJ54MTLKQ7Y]{Fury's Call}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ezVl3vFWTwHfNXL3]{Inspiring}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.V8GCeqgk1FNGFg76]{Shield of Myrmidia}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.BVZWihaal1zq3aJs]{Spear of Myrmidia}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/myrmidia.webp"}

This help typically comes in the form of impromptu protection taxes, which if not paid leave the oﬀending barge open to bandit attacks. Attacks that inevitably follow for any who refuse to pay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

And large ones, too.<br /><br />Why?<span style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: #fafafa;\"><br style=\"text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"text-size-adjust: auto;\" /></span>Well, the core book provides only a basic support for keeping and developing your own dogs (or any pets). We have a base statline for Dogs on page 315 and Wolves on page 317. We also have the rules for Henchmen on page 309.<br /><br />Why are the Henchmen rules so important? Because they are specifically designed for, amongst other things, handling pets. Let's take a look at what they say?<br /><br />In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pets are 'Henchmen'.</li>\n<li>Henchmen have full Character Sheets and are given to a Player to play alongside their PC.</li>\n<li>A Player's Henchmen earn half the XP of their PC.</li>\n<li>This XP is spent as normal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sounds great. But, can you see the missing element here?</p>\n<p>Yup, the Careers in Chapter 3 aren't exactly designed for dogs, or, indeed, any pets, so spending XP could prove a touch difficult.</p>\n<p>So, I'm going to fix that.</p>\n<p>However, before I do, there are more dog stats for us to look at. I added statlines for two breeds of dogs in&nbsp;Enemy in Shadows. These are the Telland Pit Bull on page 98, and the Ulzhammer Shepherd Dog on page 111. I also statted a 'Fighting Dog' to the&nbsp;<em>Guide to Ubersreik</em>, page 53, and there is the Dog used for pulling carts in the&nbsp;<em>Enemy in Shadows Companion</em>&nbsp;on page 22. No need to look 'em up if you don't have the books to hand; it's just good to note they exist for the moment, so you know everything I create below takes these into account.<br /><br />So, looking at those, we have a Dog, a Draught Dog, a Wolf, a Pit Bull, Shepherd Dog, and a Fighting Dog all nicely statted and ready for careers. However, we don't have a single Small but Vicious Dog.<br /><br />Call in the PCs, because this is a Warhammer crime that needs to be investigated!</p>\n<p>It's time to do some doggo statting.</p>\n<p>But, me being me, I'm not just going to do our Small But Vicious, I'm going to loosely cover all dogs. Coz it's my blog and I can.<br /><br />To do that, I'm going to stat 8 different loose domesticated dog types that'll cover all the basics I'll need. The ones I'll go for are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Herd Dogs</li>\n<li>Hound Dogs</li>\n<li>Hunting Dogs</li>\n<li>Lap Dogs</li>\n<li>Mongrel Dogs</li>\n<li>Pit Dogs</li>\n<li>Terrier Dogs</li>\n<li>War Dogs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />#AllTheDogs<br /><br />Well, almost, I'm missing out some work doggos&nbsp;&ndash; you know, ones that pull sleds or the like, the aforementioned 'draught' dog from the&nbsp;<em>Enemy in Shadows Companion</em>&nbsp;&ndash; but I'll add these later.

Stop the press. That's over a third of the Careers needing horsies. We need full rules for these, and stats! After all, we wouldn't want to leave our horsie friends without attributes, would we!</p>\n<p>So, what do we need to resolve, horse-wise? Well, let's take a look through the Careers and see what riding animals are mentioned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Destrier</li>\n<li>Draught Horse</li>\n<li>Light Warhorse</li>\n<li>Horse (we can assume this means any horse you prefer)</li>\n<li>Mule</li>\n<li>Pony</li>\n<li>Riding Horse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As expected, really, given these are all the horsies mentioned in the Consumer Guide in&nbsp;WFRP on page 306. It's almost like I planned it that way...</p>\n<p>But are all these equids properly statted in the rulebook?</p>\n<p>There are stats for the following riding animals (assuming we discount 'monsters' like Pegasi or Demigryphs and so on) in&nbsp;<strong>WFRP</strong>'s bestiary in Chapter 12:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.b1R5sW6lYIViJ2ki]{Horse}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are there any other rules to reference?<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />Thankfully, yes. There is much more horsey goodness to be found on pages 22&ndash;24 in the&nbsp;<strong>Enemy in Shadows Companion</strong>; we also get stats for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Draught Horse</li>\n<li>Heavy Warhorse (Destrier)</li>\n<li>Light Warhorse (Hobby)</li>\n<li>Pony/Donkey/Mule</li>\n<li>Riding Horse (Palfrey)</li>\n<li>Heavy Draught Horse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's much better. But I also have two primary issues.<br /><br />1) Ponies, Donkies, and Mules are all given the same stats, but are quite different animals in real life.<br />2) Ponies also cost double the price of Mules and Donkeys, but have the same stats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lawhammer.blogspot.com/2020/03/my-kingdom-for-horse.html\">WHRP: Horses</a></p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>CATS</h3>\n<p><strong>WFRP4</strong>&nbsp;needs a Cat.

On such nights, the Helspire reveals itself as a citadel of the unquiet dead, and skeletal knights charge forth, scouring the mountainside, terrorizing both Reiklanders and Bretonnian alike. Little is known about the castle, and none living claim to have pierced its bleak walls or know who commands the legions of the undead that lurk therein. Some say a cabal of necromancers call it home, others whisper it is the vault of a vampire, and a few even murmur the fortress is commanded by a powerful Liche, in life a powerful sorcerer, clinging to undeath in the pursuit of bloody vengeance for some centuries old slight. Perhaps because of this uncertainty, the Helspire is said to be filled with riches looted from across the Old World, but none know the truth, as those who seek such treasures never return or never talk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Some players write detailed backstories for their Character, especially if they are very familiar with the Old World. Others prefer to just decide the basics at the start, and then improvise during the game (discuss this with the GM beforehand so you don&rsquo;t derail any storylines). At the start of the Character creation process we recommended that you talk to the other players and the GM about the kind of group you want to create, and we revisited that while creating Party ambitions. This is the perfect place to complete that process, weaving your Characters&rsquo; stories together and binding them into a tight-knit group with their own reasons for sticking together.</p>\n<h3>Ten Questions</h3>\n<p>One useful technique for creating an interesting background for your Character is to answer a series of questions about them &mdash; here are ours! If any of these questions make you want to change something about the character you&rsquo;ve created so far... do so! For instance, if you add in some detail about your childhood, you may want to revisit the choices you made in @JournalEntry[Skills and Talents]{4) Skills and Talents}.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Where are you from?</h4>\n<p>Do you come from one of Reikland&rsquo;s bustling towns, or a sleepy village? Perhaps your childhood was spent on a remote farmstead, or maybe you called the winding back alleys of Altdorf home? Do you hail from a deep mountain hold, or were your days spent threading the roads and riverways of Reikland, always on the move?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>What is your family like?</h4>\n<p>It may take a village to raise a child, but it&rsquo;s your kin who do the heavy lifting. What were your parents&rsquo; occupations? Are they still alive? Do you have any siblings? Were you close, or were you constantly at one another&rsquo;s throats? Grandparents? Nephews, nieces, cousins? Children, even? Does your family approve of your career choice? Are they proud of you, or are you a stain on your family&rsquo;s honour?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>What was your childhood like?</h4>\n<p>Was your family home full of love, or was it a cold, inhospitable place? Were you coddled, or did you have to fend for yourself? Were you educated, and if so, by whom: a tutor, a family member, a village school, or the local priest? Were you trained in the family business, or were you sent from home, fostered elsewhere or raised in an orphanage?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Why did you leave home?</h4>\n<p>Do you still live in your childhood home, or did you leave? If so, when? Were you drawn by the promise of excitement of life in the big city? Are you in search of riches, or renown? Are you running from something, or trying to find meaning or purpose in your life?</p>\n<h4>Who are your best friends?</h4>\n<p>While you cannot choose your family, your friends are another matter entirely, and you can tell a lot about someone by the friends they keep. Do you have any friends from childhood? Or friends you&rsquo;ve made since leaving home? What do you do together? Drink? Gamble? Debate? Are your allies in your party your best friends? Or do you eschew civilised company in favour of a loyal pet?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>What is your greatest desire?</h4>\n<p>What is the fire that burns in your heart? Your Ambitions may be your chief goal, but ambitions are often prosaic or banal. If you could have anything, anything at all, what would it be?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>What are your best and worst memories?</h4>\n<p>We are the sum of our experiences; they shape and mould us, forging us anew. What are your most treasured memories? An afternoon of glorious summer sunshine? A passionate kiss, while huddling from rain, beneath sheltering boughs? A victory scored in a battle of wits or brawn? And what are your less fond recollections? A painful humiliation? A scheme thwarted? The end of a long-term partnership, romantic or business? The hatred, disdain, or, worse, disinterest of your peers?</p>\n<h4>What are your religious beliefs?</h4>\n<p>Most folk of the Empire are polytheistic; the existence, and puissance, of the gods is undeniable, and so their veneration is a matter of course. That being said, not all of the gods are favoured equally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Does your character have a fondness or affinity for one god in particular? Do you cross your fingers for luck, appealing to Ranald? Do you make the sign of the Twin Tailed Comet at your enemy, or mutter an angry prayer to Ulric before battle? See Chapter 7: Religion and Belief for details of the gods and their ways.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>To whom, or what, are you loyal?</h4>\n<p>Will you protect your friends above all, or are the ties that bind you to your clan, kinfolk, or partner stronger than iron? Or are you a pious soul, dedicated above all to your god? Or are you loyal to your community, to Reikland, the Empire&hellip; or just to yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Why are you adventuring?</h4>\n<p>And this is the big one: why are you a player character, and not just another citizen of the Empire. Why are you adventuring?</p>\n<p>Have you consciously chosen a life of adventure? Are you seeking out the enemies of the Empire, or a big pay day? Or was this life thrust upon you, against your will. Are you seeking justice, or vengeance, or is your adventuring life nothing more than a fight to clear your name, or survive your enemies?</p>\n<p>Answer all of those, and you will have a fully fleshed out character, ready to go. But, before you start playing, did you gain any bonus XP during the character creation process?

Whilst this certainly isn’t the case for every campaign, one of the main themes of Warhammer is that the Characters are normal people and that adventuring is the exception, rather than the rule, of their normal lives.</p>\n<p>If this theme is present in your campaign, and that the Characters are normal people except in the rare occasions that they’re adventuring, the rules for Between Adventures should definitely be a focus for your reading as the GM. Think of the Between Adventures rules as an alternate phase of play — we have the Adventuring Phase and the Between Adventures Phase. When not engaged in one, we’re engaged in the other!</p>\n<p>With this phase mentality, as the GM you may choose to run Between Adventures as a handful of dice rolls, quick decisions, and then move on to the next adventure. Alternately, you may have a ‘break’ session between adventures, where you employ these rules, and allow the Characters to explore their normal lives and pursue their own goals. These downtime sessions act almost more like mini adventures, which grant a lot of agency to your Players to express what they want to do and want to get out of future sessions.</p>\n<h3>A Day In The Life</h3>\n<p>The Between Adventures Phase is the perfect time to consider and adjust a Character’s Career, because it’s the best time to determine<em> if it’s actually their Career at all! </em>Are you actually a Rat Catcher if you never catch rats? Are you actually an Artisan if you don’t follow a trade? If all you do is hunch through sewers and stab mutants, exactly how much of a Scholar are you really?</p>\n<p>Both GMs and Players should be vigilant during this phase, to determine just how much a Character is actually like their Career. But make sure that this isn’t prohibitive: a Merchant doesn’t have to act like a Merchant, but maybe if she’s acting more like a Duellist, a Career change is in order? Use these shifts in attitude to help build a Character’s story, rather than direct it, and you’ll find a far more three-dimensional Character comes of it.</p>"}

He won&rsquo;t be particularly warm towards the PCs, as the Altdorf City Watch have something of a bad reputation, and will follow them about the house if they make a search to make sure they don&rsquo;t steal anything. The butler will attempt to take the PCs&rsquo; coats, and ask them to wipe their boots before entering and then lead them to meet the master of the house. The PCs can attempt a <strong>Charm or Intimidate</strong> Test to persuade the butler to answer a few questions first, but this will have a -10 penalty due to his higher social status.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, if the PCs are minded to steal something, they can probably pilfer something worth a few shillings with a <strong>Challenging (+0) Agility or Easy (+40) Sleight of Hand</strong> Test, opposed by the butler&rsquo;s Perception of 40. After all, the butler will find it difficult to watch them all at once.</p>\n<h3>Questioning the master:</h3>\n<p>The master of the house is Friedrich Von Ottinger, although he&rsquo;ll probably expect the PCs to address him as &ldquo;your lordship&rdquo; or with a similar form of address. Friedrich will meet the PCs in the parlour, which is lavishly decorated with Arabyan carpets, embroidered wall hangings depicting hunts and countryside pursuits and similar trappings. There is a stuffed bear in the corner. It will be immediately obvious to the PCs that there are items of considerable value here, which have not been stolen.</p>\n<p>Friedrich been beaten about the head and face, and is using cloth to staunch the bleeding.</p>\n<p>He is seated in a stuffed armchair, but will not invite the PCs to sit. Friedrich will attempt to take charge of the conversation as far as possible, taking notes of their names and badge numbers before answering their questions. He will also ask whether any of them can read. If they insult him, or he finds their manner particularly impertinent, then he will threaten to raise the matter with their Watch Captain.</p>\n<p>Friedrich will tell the PCs that he was at his desk in the study, reading, when two masked ruffians burst in, assaulted him, and proceeded to steal every scrap of paperwork they could lay their hands on. One of the ruffians also stole a pair of silver goblets: Friedrich will note that these valuables bore the family insignia and should therefore be easily identifiable if the PCs are quick enough to locate them before the crests can be filed off. He will express his outrage at the villains&rsquo; conduct, which was compounded by statements from their leader (Helmut Schwarz, although Friedrich doesn&rsquo;t know this) that they were <em>&ldquo;only taking what they were owed&rdquo;</em> and that they would have gladly killed him but<em> &ldquo;you&rsquo;re worth more to us alive&rdquo;</em>.</p>\n<p>Friedrich will ask pointed questions about how the PCs intend to investigate the theft.</p>\n<p>Depending on their responses, he might openly question whether the Watch has the competence to handle the matter, or whether it would be best to hire private agents. He will be content for them to search the house (under supervision), and to question the servants, but will not allow them to interrogate any of his family.</p>\n<p>If the PCs seem competent, then he will offer them a cash reward for the safe return of his papers (a Gold Crown each sounds about right for my campaign, both because it&rsquo;s their job as watchmen to do it anyway and because I would prefer to keep the PCs relatively poor, but you may need to increase this if your players will expect more.) He will note that some of the papers are concerning state matters, and the others document his family&rsquo;s personal and commercial affairs, and offer payment is the PCs agree to return these to him directly. If the PCs need the hint, they can attempt <strong>Average (+20) Intuition</strong> Tests to note that he seems deeply concerned at the loss of these papers.</p>\n<h3>Searching the mansion:</h3>\n<p>Searching the office will confirm the information Friedrich has provided. There are mucky boot prints (it&rsquo;s raining heavily outside, and he streets are filthy) across the carpet. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test will allow a PC to identify that one of the robbers limped slightly, favouring his right leg. A chair has been kicked over, and that there are blood stains on the carpet consistent with the injuries Friedrich has suffered.</p>\n<p>The desk has been ransacked, all of the draws shaken out and emptied of papers. A painting (depicting a pastoral Reikland landscape) has been thrown to the floor, and a concealed wall safe hangs open behind it. The safe has also been emptied of papers, but it&rsquo;s possible that a page has come loose and is buried away at the back of the safe (spotting it requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test). If any of the PCs can read, they&rsquo;ll see that this paperwork is from a law firm (Vogel &amp; Stein), confirming receipt of funds that have been transferred from Friedrich Von Ottinger to a company called Obsidian Enterprises to fund a property purchase. Even if they can&rsquo;t read, they might recognise the law firm&rsquo;s letterhead with a <strong>Hard (-20) Lore (Reikland)</strong> Test or an <strong>Average (+20) Lore (Law)</strong> Test.</p>\n<p>Little effort has been made to steal other valuables. Some silverware was nonetheless taken (a pair of silver chalices that were in plain view on a tray in the office), but it this appears to have been an opportunistic theft. These goods should be easily identifiable, as they bore the family insignia.</p>\n<p>Making a broader search of the mansion will confirm that the robbers appear to have used a rope to scale the wall, and broken a first floor window to enter. It looks as though one of the window panes was removed, and one of the robbers then reached inside to unlatch the window. (The missing window pane has been &ldquo;star-glazed&rdquo;, which is to say that one of the robbers used the point of a knife to crack the pane and then pried it out, pressing a heavily greased sheet of brown paper against the exterior to pull away the shards of glass without making much noise. The term &ldquo;star-glazing&rdquo; refers to the star-like pattern of cracks in the glass around the hole.) PCs from any form of law enforcement background (or from a criminal or urban poor background) will recognise this as a common trick to steal from shop windows. The PCs will find the cracked pane of glass on the ground outside.</p>\n<h3>Questioning the servants:</h3>\n<p>Depending on the approach the PCs take, and what they ask, <strong>Fellowship</strong> Tests will probably be required for the PCs to piece together information from the butler and other servants. These will generally be <strong>Average (+20)</strong>. Failure probably means that the NPCs are too scared or confused to answer clearly, although they might also seek to defer questions to higher ranking servants, or ask the PCs to wait until the master returns.</p>\n<p>There were six robbers, all of whom appear to have been human males. They seemed to know where they were going, as they went directly to the servants&rsquo; quarters to ensure that no one sounded the alarm. Two of them then left, and headed straight for the master&rsquo;s office, while the other four stood watch over the servants with weapons drawn to make sure no one tried anything. The attackers were masked, and brandished words and pistols. Some of them seemed to be wearing cast-off military clothing. They spoke with dockland Reikdorf accents.</p>\n<p>A maid (Ilse Grunberg) was recently dismissed, and one or more of the servants might speculate that she must have passed information to the robbers.</p>"}

They live humble lives, subsisting on plain foods and sleeping in shared rooms, and have little appearances to maintain. Indeed, peers are more likely to call them out for having airs and graces for spending too much on fine clothes and food than they are likely to note spending too little.<br><br></li>\n<li><strong>Silver Tier</strong>: The swelling middle-classes may use pennies for ale and gold for major purchases, but shillings are their standard currency. They dine well, sleep in comfortable beds, and wear good quality clothing.<br><br></li>\n<li><strong>Gold Tier</strong>: The wealthiest elites rarely bother themselves with pfennigs. They eat luxury foods, sleep on satin sheets, and always stand out from the crowd due to their expensive garb and trappings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For GMs preferring hard numbers, spending around half your Status every day is usually enough to maintain appearances, though you may be living a little frugally. So, if you have a Status of Silver 4, spending at least 2 shillings per day will do for food and board, where if you have Brass 2 Status, you need only spend a pfennig a day.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Money Slang</em></h3>\n<p><em>Various slang terms are used for coins across the Empire. Here are some of the more common terms.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Gold Crowns</strong>: Marks, Karls, Gelt</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Silver Shillings</strong>: Bob, Shimmies, Mucks</em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Brass Pennies</strong>: Pfennigs, Clanks, Shrapnel</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","_id":"iikC4AcL9GQl83wN"}

By Sigmar&rsquo;s grace, sit yourself down and have some cheese, there&rsquo;s nothing good for you out there!&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&ndash; @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.ePPk15Vxu9RxPtYV]{Dieter K&auml;segeier}, Cheesemonger, ex-Adventurer</p>\n<p>When your character takes an action, the GM will let you know what happens next. Sometimes, the GM will make a call based on your abilities and any other factors and decide that you achieved what you were attempting, or that you didn&rsquo;t. If the GM isn&rsquo;t sure of the outcome, or if the situation is significant or dangerous, they can resolve the action using the rules. There are a few options, as the Using Tests box shows. Tests compare a dice roll to one of the characteristics or skills on your character sheet and provide an outcome.</p>\n<h3>Simple Tests</h3>\n<p>Simple Tests are used when you need to determine if your character succeeds or fails at a simple task. Does Molli leap the churning stream? Can Wilhelm charm a lower price from the truculent merchant? Often, a quick yes or no answer to these questions allows your adventure to progress swiftly. The exception to this is when a failure would significantly impact the progress of the adventure, in which case you should use a Dramatic Test instead.</p>\n<p>To perform a Simple Test, you roll d100 and compare the result rolled to the Skill or Characteristic best suited to the action you are attempting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Note </strong>this test may be modified by the GM if it is notably easy or hard to complete (see @JournalEntry[Combat Difficulty]{Difficulty}).</p>\n<p>If you roll lower or equal to the Skill or Characteristic, the Test&rsquo;s outcome is a success, and your Character performs the task.</p>\n<p>If you roll higher than the Skill or Characteristic, the Test&rsquo;s outcome is a failure, and your Character does not perform the task.</p>\n<p>Whatever the outcome of the Test, after testing, the GM should describe what just happened so everyone understands how the Test has impacted the story.</p>\n<h3>Automatic Failure and Success</h3>\n<p>No matter how skilled or talented a character is, there is always a chance of failure. Equally, there is always a chance of success in <strong>WFRP</strong>, no matter the odds stacked against you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you roll 96&ndash;00 on any Test, it is always a failure. A failure occurs even if your modified characteristic or skill is 96 or higher. Similarly, if you roll 01&ndash;05 on a Test, it is always a success. A success occurs even if your modified characteristic or skill is less than 01&ndash;05.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Autosuccess? Not At My Table!</em></h3>\n<p><em>Not everybody likes a 5% chance of auto-success on any Test. Similarly, not everyone likes the same chance of auto-failures. If this describes you, then simply change the numbers to your taste. The most common alternative is 96&ndash;00 always fails, and 01 always succeeds.</em></p>\n<h3><em>Options: Tests Above 100%</em></h3>\n<p><em>Having exceptional abilities makes it quite possible that a modified Characteristic or Skill may be 100% or higher when tested. If this occurs in your game, you may wish to use the following optional rule to help represent such an awesome figure.</em></p>\n<p><em>A successful Test gains a bonus of +1 SL for each full 10% a tested Characteristic or Skill exceeds 100%.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz has a Charm Skill of 115%: her Fellowship characteristic of 80% plus her Charm advances of +35% (see Advances on page 47 for more on this); thus, if she succeeds at a Charm Test, she gains a bonus of +1 SL over an above what she earns by rolling or from any applicable Talents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Dramatic Tests</h3>\n<p>Simply knowing if you pass or fail is not always enough; sometimes, it is useful to know how well you succeed or how badly you fail a Test. This is especially the case when pitching your Skills against another (see Opposed Tests), which is often the case for magic and combat. So, when you want to know exactly how well or badly you have performed a Test, use a Dramatic Test.&nbsp; Another reason for choosing a Dramatic Test is when the progress of the adventure could depend on the Test. Dramatic Tests provide outcomes rather than straight success or failure, which means that even if the test is &lsquo;failed&rsquo; the adventure continues, albeit in a more challenging way than if you had achieved a success. Dramatic Tests are handled in the same way as Simple Tests, and still provide success or failure as outcomes, but the results have more detail. This detail is governed by Success Levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Success Levels</h4>\n<p>Success Levels (shortened to SL) are used to describe the effectiveness of a Test. To determine the SL of a Test, subtract the 10s number of the rolled dice from the 10s number of the Characteristic or Skill being tested, including any modifiers (see Difficulty for more on modifiers). The higher the SL, the better the outcome; the lower it is, the worse things have gone. Marginal results, where you succeed or fail a Test with +0 or &ndash;0 SL, could either be interpreted as succeeding or failing by a whisker, with minimal consequences either good or bad, or could give inconclusive results allowing you try again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Exactly how well you succeed or fail is shown in the Outcomes Table, which can be used to inspire descriptions of what just happened. Much like simple tests offer a yes or no in answer to &lsquo;do I succeed at this test?&rsquo;, dramatic tests also provide answers, just more of them.</p>\n<p>If you automatically succeed due to rolling 01&ndash;05 (see page 150), you score +1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>If you automatically fail due to rolling 96&ndash;00 (see page 150), you score &ndash;1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is lower.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Eichengard is careering across muddy fields atop his stallion, desperately fleeing the lands of a disgruntled noble when a wall blocks his passage. He decides to push his mount to jump, and the GM calls for a Dramatic Ride (Horse) test. Eichengard rolls 29 against his Ride (Horse) skill of 41. The 10s number of&nbsp;</em><em>the Skill being tested is 4, and the 10s number rolled was 2, so the test succeeds with +2 SL (4&ndash;2=2) and he clears the wall with space to spare. Buoyed by his success, Eichengard twists around in his saddle and makes the sign of the twin-tailed comet at the horsemen pursuing him. Unfortunately, this means he&rsquo;s not paying attention to where he&rsquo;s going. The GM calls for a Dramatic Perception Test, and Eichengard&rsquo;s player rolls 82, significantly higher than Eichengard&rsquo;s Perception skill of 39. The 10s number of the roll is 8, and the 10s number of the skill being tested is 3, so the test has failed with &ndash;5 SL (3&ndash;8=&ndash;5). He has failed rather badly. As Eichengard laughs at the increasingly distant guards sent to capture him, a low-lying branch slams hard into his side, knocking him flying.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Fast SL</em></h3>\n<p><em>Determining your SL involves some simple mathematics, so calculating it can slow play during fraught scenes. Fortunately, there is a fast way to calculate SL for those looking to keep their games as fast as possible. When you pass a Test, use the result of the tens die as your SL. So, if you passed a Test with a roll of 36, you score +3 SL. With this optional rule, the closer you roll to your tested Skill, the better, rather than rolling low being best. If a Test fails, you calculate SL as normal, taking your rolled tens die from your tested Skill to determine your negative SL.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Outcomes Table</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%; height: 158px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\"><strong>SL</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\"><strong>Result</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>Have You Succeeded?</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 30px;\">+6 or more</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 30px;\">Astounding Success</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 30px;\"><strong>Yes, perfectly!</strong>: The result is as good as it can be, perhaps with extra luck and fortunate coincidences thrown in!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">+4 to +5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Impressive Success</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>Yes, and&hellip;:</strong> You achieve your goal with style, exceeding your expectations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">+2 to +3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Success</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>Yes</strong>: You achieve a solid success.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">+0 to +1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Marginal Success</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>Yes, but&hellip;:</strong> You more or less achieve what you intend, but imperfectly, and perhaps with an unpredictable side effect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">-1 to -0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Marginal Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>No, but&hellip;:</strong> You marginally fail, perhaps accomplishing a portion of what you intended.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">-2 to -3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>No</strong>: You just plain do it wrong.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">-4 to -5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Impressive Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\"><strong>No, and&hellip;</strong>: Not only do you mess up, but you also cause additional things to go wrong.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.21875%; height: 16px;\">-6 or less</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7813%; height: 16px;\">Astounding Failure</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.0625%; height: 16px;\">\n<p><strong>No, not in any way!</strong>: Everything goes wrong in the worst possible way.

Surely no-one is this unlucky; you have clearly offended the gods.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Criticals &amp; Fumbles</em></h3>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal;\">We introduce some extra rules for Criticals and Fumbles in Combat later in this chapter. They can also be used to add drama for all Tests, creating a game that feels epic in scope as extreme results become commonplace. If that describes your group, you could use the following optional rule.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal;\">Any Test scoring a success that also rolls a double is called a Critical, meaning you&rsquo;ve scored an Astounding Success from the Outcome Table; and any failure including a double is a Fumble, resulting in an Astounding Failure from the Outcome Table. This optional rule works well with Simple Tests, providing a fun addition to the yes or no results offered there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Difficulty</h3>\n<p>Not all Tests are equal. Climbing a fence is laughably easy but ascending the face of a sheer cliff is incredibly tough. To represent this, the GM assigns bonuses or penalties to Tests called the Difficulty . While published adventures define the difficulty for the GM &mdash; for example: calling for a <strong>Hard (&ndash;20) Research</strong> test &mdash; there are many instances where the GM has to determine them on the fly. Making judgments like this is one of the most common functions of the GM. For each Test, whether simple or dramatic, the GM should decide the Difficulty and then consult the Difficulty Table to determine the appropriate modifier. GMs may choose to assign even greater bonuses or penalties than those shown on the table, but such modifiers should only be used in extreme situations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Valentyn, a Jade Wizard, tries to find the tracks of an unruly stag he is hunting. Under normal circumstances, he would perform an <strong>Average (+20) Track</strong> Test with his skill of 41, thus test against 61; however, the GM decides that as the rain last night washed away most of the tracks the task is Very Hard and imposes a &ndash;30 penalty. Therefore, Valentyn has to roll 11 or under (41&ndash;30=11) to succeed. He rolls a 35, which would have been a success under normal circumstances, but in this circumstance is a failure, indicating the rain has foiled the Jade Wizard&rsquo;s attempt.</em></p>\n<h4>Opposed Tests</h4>\n<p>Sometimes you match your capabilities directly against those of an opponent. The rules represent this with a special Dramatic Test called an Opposed Test. Opposed Tests are an important part of <strong>WFRP&rsquo;s </strong>combat rules later in this chapter, but are used in many other situations, as well.</p>\n<p>An Opposed Test is handled just like any other Dramatic Test, but both parties make a Test. The party with the highest SL wins the Test. If both participants score the same SL, the party with the higher tested Skill or Characteristic wins. In the unlikely event there is still a tie, then one of two things, as determined by the GM, occurs: 1) there is a stalemate, and nothing happens; 2) both parties re-roll until there is a clear winner.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Having floored an important Reiklander baron at a party, Salundra makes to leave the ballroom; however, some uneasy guardsmen block her passage, knowing they really should detain the noble captain. Salundra scowls as she approaches.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>The GM calls for an Intimidate Test and opposes it with the guardsmen&rsquo;s commanding officer&rsquo;s Leadership Test. Both the player and the GM roll. Salundra&rsquo;s Intimidate is 47. The officer&rsquo;s Leadership is 46. Salundra rolls a 04, scoring +4 SL (4&ndash;0=4), while the GM rolls 16, scoring +3 SL (4&ndash;1=3). As Salundra&rsquo;s SL is higher (4 to the officer&rsquo;s 3), she successfully intimidates the guards, who let her pass with barely a grumble.</em></p>\n<p>Like any other Tests, some Opposed Tests are easier or harder than others, so the GM may decide modifiers are required. In most cases, these modifiers are applied equally to both sides, but not always. If no Difficulty is marked for an Opposed Test, it is assumed to be <strong>Challenging (+0).</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it is important to know how well the winner of the Opposed Test won, use the difference between the two results to determine a final SL.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:<em> It&rsquo;s Pie Week, an annual week-long festival for everyone&rsquo;s favourite baked goods, and Salundra has entered a pie-eating contest. She&rsquo;s reached the final, and it&rsquo;s her versus Fat Tom Brandysnap, the Ubersreik Pie Eating Champion for the last 5 years running, and a Halfling wider than he is tall.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>The GM calls for an Opposed Endurance Test. Salundra has an Endurance of 45 and Fat Tom has 63. Salundra is possibly in trouble! Dice roll, and Salundra rolls 51, scoring &ndash;1 SL. Sali&rsquo;s looking a little green! But Fat Tom&rsquo;s looking worse! He rolls 91 for &ndash;3 SL. So, even though she&rsquo;s failed her Endurance roll, she still wins the Opposed Test by 2 SL, though she&rsquo;ll probably be bringing up most of those pies later!</em></p>\n<h4>Extended Tests</h4>\n<p>Sometimes the adventure will call for a specific number of Success Levels be achieved to fully succeed at a time-consuming or especially taxing task. Doing this requires a special Dramatic Test called an Extended Test. Extended Tests are handled in the same fashion as any other Dramatic Test, but the SL scored from multiple rolls are added together to reach a specified target. If the total SL scored ever falls below 0, you can start again from scratch with the next roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong><em>: On the run again, Molli is attempting to pick an unexpectedly complex lock before she is discovered. The GM states the lock requires 5 Success Levels with a Challenging (+0) Pick Lock Test to pry open, and that she only has three Rounds before the guard arrives. Molli&rsquo;s Pick Lock skill is 58, so she has a good chance of managing it, but time isn&rsquo;t on her side. Unfortunately for her, her first Test scores 63: &ndash;1 SL and a terrible start, she&rsquo;s made no progress and will start from scratch next round.&nbsp; Cursing under her breath as footsteps draw closer, Molli tries again, this time scoring 11, for +4 SL! She feels tension in her picks as the lock almost springs, but she also hears the approaching guard is even closer.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>The GM explains the next Test is the last one before the guard arrives, so Molli can either abandon her attempt and avoid the guard or make a desperate effort to secure the last SL she needs&nbsp;to pick the lock. Knowing she needs to escape, Molli risks the last Test and rolls, scoring&hellip; 42! That&rsquo;s +1 SL, taking her to a total of 5. The lock opens with a click! Triumphant, Molli slips through the door and closes it behind her just before the guard arrives.</em></p>\n<h3>Assistance</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Assistance]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Combining Skills</em></h3>\n<p><em>Sometimes, you may be in a situation where you feel two Skills should be tested by the same character for a single task, so it may be appropriate to combine those Skills for a single Test. There are generally two reasons to do this: 1) is faster and limits the number of dice rolls required to press on with the game; 2) having to pass two Tests in a row to perform a single task significantly reduces your chance of passing overall.</em></p>\n<p><em>The simplest way to do this is to attempt both Skills with one Test, comparing a single percentile roll to each Skill number. If both pass, you succeed at the Test. If only one passes, you partially pass as appropriate. And, obviously, if both fail, you have failed the Test.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>After a string of unlikely events, Salundra finds herself on-stage in yellow and red tights, singing and dancing in the Vargr Breughel Memorial Playhouse&rsquo;s inaugural production of &lsquo;Tell Me On A Festag&rsquo;. The GM calls for a <strong>Challenging Combined Perform (Dance) and Entertain (Sing)</strong> Test, thinking it unfair Salundra should have to enact each Test in turn as that would significantly reduce her overall chance of success. Salundra has Perform (Dance) at 53 from her time in court, but doesn&rsquo;t have Entertain (Sing), so must use her Fellowship of 43. She then rolls 46, meaning she managed the dance (succeeded with +1 SL), but hit a few off-notes with her singing (failed at -0 SL) &mdash; not perfect, but good enough for the gathered crowds; though Kym Neumann, the Altdorf Spieler&rsquo;s theatre critic, may not be writing a favourable review...</p>\n</blockquote>"}

It describes your training, social class, and your future prospects. <strong>WFRP </strong>groups similar Careers into Classes.</p>\n<h3>Classes</h3>\n<p>A summary of each Class is found in @JournalEntry[Class And Career]. Classes organise Careers into easily referenced groups. They also impact character development, provide different starting Trappings during Character Creation, and influence how you can change Career (see Changing Career). Some Classes have access to different Endeavours &mdash; activities you can take between adventures.</p>\n<p>The summary and illustration at the top of the eight Careers in your chosen Class should give you a good idea of which is the one for you. The Careers can be considered to be as broad as possible, so you are encouraged to interpret them imaginatively as part of your Character concept.</p>\n<h3>Career Levels</h3>\n<p>Every Career has four levels, each progressively better than the last. If you take a look at Apothecary, the first Academic Career, you can see the four levels are:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Apprentice Apothecary</em></li>\n<li><em>Apothecary</em></li>\n<li><em>Master Apothecary</em></li>\n<li><em>Apothecary-General</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When choosing a Career for a new character, you always start at the first level of the career &mdash; so, if you were an Apothecary, you would start as an Apprentice Apothecary.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Advancing Through Your Career</h3>\n<p>Your Character&rsquo;s Career affects how they will grow through experience. Every Career offers three forms of Advances: Characteristic Advances, Skill Advances, and Talent Advances &mdash; each of which are purchased with Experience Points (XP). You can also use XP to Change Career. Your Career Level determines what Characteristics, Skills, and Talents are available to you.</p>\n<h4>Characteristic Advances</h4>\n<p>Every Career has an Advance Scheme governing its Characteristic Advances. The Advance Scheme shows your character&rsquo;s 10 Characteristics, 3 marked with <strong>I</strong>, 1 marked with <strong>II</strong>, 1 marked with <strong>III</strong>, and the last marked with <strong>IV</strong>.</p>\n<p>The three marked <strong>I</strong> are Characteristics you can advance in the first level of the Career. When you enter the second level of a career, the <strong>II </strong>Characteristic also becomes available. When you enter the third level, the <strong>III </strong>Characteristic also becomes available. And when you enter the fourth and last level of a Career, the <strong>IV</strong> Characteristic finally becomes available.</p>\n<p>The cost in XP of a Characteristic Advance is shown by hovering over the advancement indicator (the plus symbol), and depends on the number of Characteristic Advances you have already taken in that Characteristic.</p>\n<p>Each Characteristic Advance adds +1 to the associated Characteristic. So, if you had purchased 4 Agility Advances, and your Initial Agility was 27, your Current Agility would be 31. The Advances would cost 25 XP per +1 Advance, as at each point the number of Advances previously taken would be in the 0&ndash;5 range.</p>\n<p>There is no upper limit to the number of Characteristic Advances that can be purchased, although higher levels do become prohibitively expensive. <strong>Note</strong>: While Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill have the word &lsquo;Skill&rsquo; in them, this is only a historical artefact &mdash; they are characteristics and are Advanced as such.</p>\n<h4>Skill Advances</h4>\n<p>You can advance all the Skills listed for your Career level and lower. So, if you were an Apothecary&rsquo;s Apprentice (level 1), you could only access the Skills listed under Apothecary&rsquo;s Apprentice (level 1). But, if you were a Master Apothecary (level 3), you could access all the Skills for Master Apothecary (level 3), Apothecary (level 2), and Apprentice Apothecary (level 1).</p>\n<p>The cost in XP of a Skill Advance is shown by hovering over the advancement indicator and depends on the number of Skill Advances you have already taken in that Skill.</p>\n<p>Each Skill Advance adds +1 to your Skill level. Therefore, if you had purchased 9 Advances in Stealth and your Agility was 31, your Stealth would be 40. The first 5 Advances would cost 10 XP each, and the 4 remaining Advances would cost 15 XP each.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: One of the Skills in the first level of your Career will be marked in italics. This is the Skill you Test when @JournalEntry[Status] money.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Like Characteristic Advances, there is no upper limit to the number of Skill Advances that can be purchased.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Non-Career Advances</em></h3>\n<p><em>Characters will inevitably want to advance Characteristics and Skills not listed in their Careers. That&rsquo;s fine, if the GM feels it&rsquo;s appropriate, but it costs double. The GM might want you to find a teacher or otherwise play out this unusual education.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Non-Career Characteristic and Skill Advances cost double the amount of XP listed in the Characteristic and Skill Improvement XP Costs table.</em></p>\n<p><em>Normally, non-Career Talents may not be purchased with XP, although Training and Unusual Learning Endeavours in Chapter 6: Between Adventures provide an opportunity to purchase non-Career Advances as if they were Career Advances, and give the possibility of learning non-Career Talents.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Talent Advances</h4>\n<p>Talents are only available when you are in the level of the Career that lists them. So, if you are an Apothecary-General, you can only buy Talents listed under Apothecary-General, not those listed under Apprentice Apothecary, Apothecary, or Master Apothecary.</p>\n<p><strong>Talents Advances cost 100 XP +100 XP per Advance already taken in that Talent.</strong></p>\n<p>The first time you purchase a new Talent (for 100 XP) it grants you access to the Talent&rsquo;s special rules. If you purchase a Talent multiple times (second time costs 200 XP, third 300 XP) any additional abilities bestowed are listed in the Talent description.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all Talents can be purchased multiple times. Check the Talent listing for any limitations.</p>\n<h3>Changing Career</h3>\n<p>When you have taken all the Advances you want in your current Career, it&rsquo;s time to change Career. Changing Career means one of two things:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1)<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Moving to a different level within your current Career (from Apothecary to Master Apothecary ); or</p>\n<p>2)<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>Moving to an entirely new Career (from Apothecary to Scholar).</p>\n<p>In each case, you will have to first determine if you have completed your current Career level. If you have, changing Career costs 100 XP. If you have not, it costs 200 XP.</p>\n<h4>Completing a Career</h4>\n<p>Completing a Career represents mastering your current vocation and being ready to move on to something new. To complete a Career, you must have the number of Advances listed below in all your Career level&rsquo;s Characteristics and in eight of your Career level&rsquo;s available Skills. You must also have at least 1 Talent from your current Career level. Skills and Talents you have gained from advancement prior to entering your current Career count towards this..</p>\n<table style=\"height: 109px; width: 19.0642%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; height: 16px; width: 37.0313%;\">Level</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; height: 16px; width: 62.1875%;\">Advances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; height: 16px; width: 37.0313%;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; height: 16px; width: 62.1875%;\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; height: 16px; width: 37.0313%;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; height: 16px; width: 62.1875%;\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; height: 16px; width: 37.0313%;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; height: 16px; width: 62.1875%;\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; height: 16px; width: 37.0313%;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; height: 16px; width: 62.1875%;\">20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Just because you have completed a Career level does not mean you have to move to a new one. Moving Career is always entirely up to you. If you wish to stay in the first level of Pauper forever, that&rsquo;s completely fine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Customize Your Trappings</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Trappings listed in each Career are guidelines only. Feel free to be creative with your Trappings, choosing those that fit your interpretation of your character&rsquo;s Career and how it manifests. So, if you were using the Soldier Career to represent a grizzled Handgunner from reikland&rsquo;s State Army, you may decide to tweak the required Trappings to include powder and shot.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Trappings are how you are recognised as someone belonging to your career. if you want to go incognito, you might not want to have all your trappings with you. Similarly, if you are trying to use the authority of your Career, not having the trappings of such means people might not take you seriously.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Changing to a New Level</h4>\n<p>If you have completed your current Career level, you can enter the next Career level, or any lower Career level, for 100 XP. So, if you completed Hunter (Hunter level 2), you could exit to Tracker (Hunter level 3) or Trapper (Hunter level 1) for 100 XP, but not Huntsmaster (Hunter level 4).</p>\n<p>With GM permission, you can also skip Career levels. This is normally driven by in-game events. For example: A Scion (Noble level 1) inherits a significant estate during play, so the GM offers Noble Lord (Noble level 4) as a potential change of Career. Like normal, changing to this Career level costs 100 XP if you have completed your current Career level, or 200 XP if you have not.</p>\n<h4>Changing to a New Career</h4>\n<p>If you have completed your current Career level, you can enter the first level of any Career from your Class for 100 XP, or for 200 XP if you have not completed your current Career level. If you want to enter the first level of a Career from a different Class, this cost an extra 100 XP. Note: your GM may require in-game justification for such Career changes; after all, not just anyone can enter Noble, even if you are in the Courtier Class.</p>\n<p>Further, if you have completed your current Career level, with GM permission, and solid justification, you can enter the same Career level in any Career within your Class. So, if you completed Master Apothecary (Apothecary level 3), you could move to Fellow (Scholar level 3), to show you were taking a teaching position in Altdorf University. This costs 100 XP. However, be aware there are obvious limitations here. Some Careers, such as Wizard, require the basics be learned before the more advanced lore can be understood and the Talents of earlier Career levels will not be open to you at a higher level.</p>\n<p>Lastly, between adventures, you can also change Career using the @JournalEntry[Changing Career].</p>\n<table style=\"height: 80px; width: 63.1536%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 39.1158%; text-align: center;\"><strong>Improvement</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 116.2%; text-align: center;\"><strong>XP Cost</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 39.1158%; text-align: center;\">+1 Talent Advance&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 116.2%; text-align: center;\">100 XP + 100 XP Per time the Talent is already taken</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 39.1158%; text-align: center;\">Leave a Complete Career</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 116.2%; text-align: center;\">100 XP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 39.1158%; text-align: center;\">Leave an Incomplete Career</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 116.2%; text-align: center;\">200 XP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 39.1158%; text-align: center;\">Enter a different Class</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 116.2%; text-align: center;\">+100 XP</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

Further, for each Creature Trait a new breed has, or step increase with the <em>Size</em> Trait (e.g.: from Small to Medium), the costs increase by another 10/&ndash;. Lastly, for each Decrease (which I'll count as each &ndash;5 in an Attribute or &ndash;1 Move), the cost for the breed decreases by 1/&ndash;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Change</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cost</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Each Advance</td>\n<td>+1/&ndash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Each new Trait or Size increase</td>\n<td>+10/&ndash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Each Decrease</td>\n<td>&ndash;1/&ndash;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, let's apply that to the Telland. It has 11 Advances, 1 Decrease, and 2 Traits when compared to the Pit Dog. That equates to +11/&ndash;, &ndash;1/&ndash;, +20/&ndash;. So, and extra +20/&ndash; on top of the base 2GC for a Pit Hound. So the Telland has a base cost of 3GC 10/&ndash;.<br /><br />Nice. What about the Ulzhammer?<br /><br />Well, it has 16 Advances, 3 Decreases, and 3 new Traits, so +16/&ndash;, &ndash;3/&ndash;, +30/&ndash;. Adding that to the base cost of 2 GC for a Herding Dog, we get base cost of 4GC 3/&ndash;.<br /><br />That... works well enough for me. I don't feel I need rules to create the different breeds (I'll simply make them up as needed later in this post), but some rules for costing them will be handy. And the ones above do nicely.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if I'm sorting prices for buying and selling doggos, I should also consider Item Qualities, especially if I'm considering creating special breeds like the Telland or Ulzhammer. After all, pure-bred animals always cost more, which sounds like the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to me.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />However, the normal Item Qualities rules don't really apply as Dogs are living creatures, so I'm going to limit it to just the one I need. So I'll just use the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to represent a pedigree.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />So, the more&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Qualities purchased, the stronger the bloodline of the animal, and the more impressive it appears. This brings no advantages beyond bragging rights and high returns if the animal is ever sold. So, if a Player wants to buy any special breed beyond the generic versions presented at the beginning of this post, at least 1 instance of&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;should have to be bought to show it's a purebred animal accessing the special rules. I'll not make that a firm rule, as I may wish to keep costs low at some points; it's more of a guideline that I'll almost always follow.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />That would mean a typical Telland actually starts at 7GC (the base cost of 3GC 10/&ndash; is doubled because of the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality). Obviously, Mongrels cannot purchase the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to represent breeding, but it could be purchased to show a dog with a particularly pretty face or similar.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />That'll do.<br /><br />Equally, I'll dump the Item Flaws outside&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em>. Taking the&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em>&nbsp;Flaw for your pet shows it's particularly ill-favoured in appearance, which may come with penalties in some situations.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />Normally, both&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;can't be applied to a single doggo, but I'm sure there are examples of ugly versions of purebred animals, so I'll not make that a hard rule, and leave it to individual circumstances to dictate.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />So, let's put all of that into action with a variety of new breeds for each of the Dog types, alongside their prices. I'll use the formula I quickly pulled from nowhere for most of the coin costs here, but a few breeds will break this as they are especially rare.</p>"}
{"_id":"jb3aJ8BLgyGHPLmG","name":"The Briefing - Date: Angestag, 16 Vorhexen","permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"DMQs1UveUtlyzPKt","sort":1100001,"flags":{},"content":"<p>Once you have given everyone their character notes, given them time to read them and answered any questions the players might have read the following out to the players:</p>\n<p>It is a short while before your shift is due to begin and you have all gathered in one of the small offices at the back of the Luitpoldstrasse Station in order to receive a briefing from one of the Captains attached to this station, Captain Marcus Trenker. He opens the door to the office and as he does so the sound of raised voices can be heard, coming from both the foyer outside and the holding cells beneath the building. Captain Trenker shuffles some papers before him before launching into his brief.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Morning, well, we all know that the big news at the moment is of this Pattern Killer that&rsquo;s doing the rounds, every Mondstille seems to bring another of these sick whoresons out of the woodwork, must be the cold. This one has a taste for halflings, we&rsquo;ve found three victims so far, two Angestag the week before last, and the first one Angestag two weeks before that. This means we&rsquo;re well due another if he&rsquo;s to keep the pattern up, so keep your eye out. These killings have brought us a lot of publicity, you know how the little people like to kick up a fuss, so watch out for reporters for the Altdorf Speiler. Also keep a look out for a Halfling named Heiro Juniper. He&rsquo;s some Mootland loudmouth who thinks he&rsquo;s looking after the interests of Altdorf&rsquo;s Halflings by wasting Watch time. If he bothers you during your patrol just tell him to come and see me.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The last victim, as I&rsquo;m sure you know, was one Hugo Shortshank, who has been giving us a merry old run-around these last few months. The killer poisoned him with his own Wierdroot supply.</p>\n<p>Can&rsquo;t say that the little runt didn&rsquo;t deserve it, frankly. We&rsquo;ve received a tip-off that the halfling used to visit the Mermaid Tavern a great deal, but he wasn&rsquo;t known as a drinker, so maybe that&rsquo;s where he bought his supply. It usually opens about midday, so swing by there on your rounds and make a few enquiries.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Some joker&rsquo;s been pasting up posters trying to get everyone panicked about Ratmen living in Altdorf&rsquo;s sewer system. It&rsquo;s probably just a student prank, but keep your eye out for him and if you spot him bring him in. And find out where he's getting his posters.</p>\n<p>\"Someone set fire to a barge down by three-toll bridge last night. Raimun Sager got kneecapped by a dwarf apparently. I'd say it was gang-related, but Adolf and his cronies over in the bridge station swore they saw some horrible bats or something flying around it when they went to investigate. I really don't want the witch hunters down here breathing down our necks, we've got enough on our plates already, so if you could make a few subtle inquiries - maybe find out what was on it, who loaded it and such. Maybe we can have something to hand over if they come sniffing round. The barge was the Miss Bedenklich</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And make sure you swing by the warehouses near the Hook Wharfs this morning, one of their members is claiming that they&rsquo;ve seen a goblin running around in there. Could just be wasting our time or suffering from some weirdroot vision, but take a look anyway &ndash; they&rsquo;d be stupid to joke about this seeing as it might well affect the confidence of their customers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Other than that it&rsquo;s more of the usual I&rsquo;m afraid, drunks, thieves, harlots and gang fights. Any questions?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be careful out there, lads.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Trenker gathers some effects. If no one has any questions for him he leaves and goes down to the cells to see what all the fuss is about. Mention again that as the door to the office opens a number of different raised voices can be heard.</p>\n<p>Trenker then becomes embroiled in @JournalEntry[ekuOD5t7AJvJvdvJ]{The Case of the Arrested Noble}.</p>\n<h2>THE FOYER</h2>\n<p>As soon as the patrol exit the office they enter the foyer. From a stairwell leading down to the cells they can hear a cultured Wissenlander voice demanding <em>&ldquo;How dare you keep me incarcerated here, don&rsquo;t you know who I am? I&rsquo;ll have you thrashed man! Thrashed!&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>At the desk are a group of three men, who are all tired and unshaven looking. They have suntanned faces and curly black greasy hair. They are debating loudly in a language none of the group can understand. The desk staff, Inga Schultz (an ex-thief) and Eric Dangon (an ex-roadwarden) also seem confused. The foreigners are getting louder and more exasperated.</p>\n<p>A PC moving towards the cells will catch Inga&rsquo;s attention. <em>&ldquo;Leave it be!&rdquo;</em> She&rsquo;ll call out, <em>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s just some lout who&rsquo;s getting gobby, the Captain&rsquo;s dealing with &lsquo;im, best leave &lsquo;im to it, eh?&rdquo;</em> Anyone can identify the language being spoken by the men as Tilean on a successful<strong> Average (+20) Intelligence</strong> Test. If no one gets it make sure they use some stock phrases, <em>&ldquo;Mama Mia!&rdquo; </em>and the like. If Eric is asked if he recognises the language, but cannot understand or speak it.</p>\n<p>Engaging with the Tileans via mime might work, and be a break from describing the game for the GM and players. The Tileans will try to mime the following info:</p>\n<p>&bull; Ugly face. Bandy legged gait. Sneer. Where?</p>\n<p>The Tileans are here to deliver a bunch of specimens to the University of Altdorf, and a goblin has been stolen from their boat.</p>\n<p>The PCs will make no more headway without an interpreter, however. If or when they have one, or if they are really great mime artists, they can look into @JournalEntry[5zopWtNNkCYdQ0ow]{The Case of the Upset Tileans}.</p>\n<p>The PCs could talk to Eric and Inga. Eric is somewhat tight-lipped and seems very angry about something. Inga is a good source of gossip (tests with her are <strong>Easy (+40)</strong>) and can be pumped for some local rumours, though she will not say much more than what&rsquo;s in the Speiler or opinions of local bad lads.</p>\n<p>Asked about the prisoner downstairs she says: <em>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s some southern fug wot Sergeant Troltz&rsquo;s patrol picked up last night. Beatin&rsquo; the daylights out of some &lsquo;arlot &lsquo;e was &ndash; made a right mess of &lsquo;er. &lsquo;E claims &lsquo;e&rsquo;s some sort of hoity-toity to do type &lsquo;e does, but &lsquo;e&rsquo;s just tryin&rsquo; to avoid trouble if y&rsquo;arsk me. Captain&rsquo;ll sort &lsquo;im aht, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<h2>THE BEATEN BAWD</h2>\n<p>Then just as the PCs decide to leave the foyer a man stumbles through it, covered in blood. They recognise him instantly as Tristan Mahler, a local bawd who also has a history of smuggling. Inga rushes over to tend to his wounds. The PCs can ignore him if they wish, or they can try to help him recover and talk to him, in which case go to @JournalEntry[ZbDsbmx9A22WB2ST]{The Case of the Beaten Bawd}.</p>\n<h2>OUTSIDE THE STATION</h2>\n<p>It is mid-morning and music week is already getting underway, all along the Luitpoldstrasse and the Street of 100 Taverns different musicians are playing a variety of instruments with wildly varying degrees of skill and success. Just outside the station a fiddler will be scratching his way through a very poor rendition of &ldquo;Drakwald Lament&rdquo;, a group of people gather round pelting him with rotten vegetables, but he carries on gamefully.</p>\n<p>A little way up from a bodrhan player inexpertly bangs his drum. The second time the Watch pass him he is banging the rim with his stick, as someone has punctured the skin of his drum. The third time they pass him he lies in the gutter unconscious, the tattered remains of his drum around his neck. The fourth time they pass nothing is there but a pool of blood. The next time they pass a dulcian player stands in his place, parping his way through &ldquo;The Lazy Sonne&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>All sorts try to make an impression during music week. A trio with mandolin, cittern and lute play beautiful music, casting evil looks at a nearby hurdy-gurdy player, whose caterwauling drowns them out somewhat. At one point the PCs may even see a noble wheel a large and beautifully decorated harpsichord balanced on a flat-bed cart out into the street - his bodyguards make sure that his audience keep their distance whilst he deftly plays a number of Bretonnian laments.</p>"}

This is always a choice for you, not the GM — although there is nothing wrong with the GM gently reminding you that you could try again. After all, what’s the worst that could happen?</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Options: Encroaching Darkness...</span></h3>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\"><em>Some inventive players prefer to embellish their dark deals with disturbing events happening in-game. If you like the sound of this, it’s up to you how such events should manifest, but tailoring them to the story of the character involved is always a good idea. Perhaps taint subtly influences the local area causing animals to flee or plants to gently rot?&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" aria-level=\"2\"><em>Perhaps you could roll on the @Table[minormis]{Miscast table} to create a random event (especially appropriate for wizards and witches)?

Should you survive long enough to gain more mutations than your Toughness Bonus, or more mental corruptions than your Willpower Bonus, you have fallen to Chaos, your soul completely lost to the uncaring Chaos Gods. At this point, it’s time to create a new character. Your current one is now damned, becoming an NPC controlled by the GM, meaning you may well see the wretched creature again…</p>\n<h3>Losing Corruption Points</h3>\n<p>Once the claws of the Dark Gods have sunk into your soul, removing their vile stain is difficult, but not impossible. Beyond the less-than-desirable option of losing Corruption points by gaining mutations, there are two other methods of losing Corruption points: dark whispers and absolution .</p>\n<h4>Dark Whispers</h4>\n<p>Even considering the inscrutable plans of the Dark Gods is enough to break a pious man’s sanity, so trying to fathom their intent, and why they reach out to twist one mortal soul or another, is not just foolish, it’s extraordinarily dangerous. But reach out they do.</p>\n<p>The GM may ask to spend one of your Corruption points to use the darkness building in your soul to twist your actions. The choice to do this or not is always in your hands, but if you agree, you lose 1 Corruption Point. Examples of what may be asked include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Letting an enemy escape.</li>\n<li>‘Accidentally’ shooting an ally.</li>\n<li>Falling asleep on watch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Of course, if you deny the GM and choose to do none of those potentially terrible things, you keep your Corruption point, but the Ruinous Powers still hold a portion of your soul.</p>\n<h4>Absolution</h4>\n<p>As Corruption points build, and you feel the oppressive fist of the Dark Gods curling around your beleaguered soul, your dread may lead you to seek absolution. But simply asking forgiveness from a local preacher won’t be enough. The stain of the Dark Gods’ touch isn’t so easily scrubbed clean. The exact limits of what is required to remove Corruption is left in the hands of the GM, but it is rarely, if ever, simple.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Printed adventures may include situations where Corruption can be removed, but if you wish to seek your own route to absolution, consider the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cleanse a profane temple to the Dark Gods. Though the very act may expose you to more corruption…</li>\n<li>Complete a holy pilgrimage and receive a blessing from a high priest at the end of the long, dangerous journey.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Destroy an unholy artefact, or otherwise render it safe, foiling the schemes of the Dark Gods.</li>\n<li>Join a holy order and dedicate your life to one of the Gods opposed to Chaos.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Slow Manifestations</em></h3>\n<p><em>Manifesting a mutation of the body or mind can come quickly, but normally it’s a slow process, perhaps starting as an itch, patch of flaky skin, or a new tic, and only later developing into a new eye, unexpected feathers, or an entirely new mindset. If you would prefer to draw the mutation process out, perhaps to play upon the horror of the inevitable mutations to come, you are encouraged to do so. This is left in the hands of the GM to detail according to individual taste and preference.</em></p>\n</blockquote>"}

Because of this, the best examples of the species are perceived to be important status symbols, and are bought and sold for extraordinary prices.</p>\n<h5 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-weight: bolder; margin: 16pt 0px 0pt;

If you Charge, your Action must be a Melee Test to attack an opponent. If your opponent is at least your Move characteristic in yards away before you Charge, but within your Run range (see the Run entry in the Movement Table for how far you can move when Charging), you will also gain +1 Advantage as you barrel into your opponent.</p>\n<h4>Disengaging</h4>\n<p>If you are @JournalEntry[Attacking]{Engaged} in combat, and no longer wish to be trading blows with your opponent, you have the following two options for leaving combat safely.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Advantage</strong>: If you have more Advantage than your opponents, you are in a superior position and can easily&nbsp;</p>\n<p>manoeuvre yourself beyond reach. If you choose to drop your Advantage to 0, you can move away from your opponents without penalty, perhaps choosing to Charge a new target, run away as fast as possible, or backstep a little and fire a pistol in an opponent’s face!</p>\n<p><strong>Use Dodge</strong>: If you have lower or equal Advantage to your opponents or do not wish to spend your Advantage, you are pinned in place. If you wish to escape, you will need to use your Action to make an <strong>Opposed Dodge/Melee</strong> Test. If you succeed, you gain +1 Advantage, and can use your Move to go anywhere you wish using the normal rules. If you fail, each opponent defeating you gains +1 Advantage and makes it impossible for you to escape without a blow to your back.</p>\n<h4>Fleeing</h4>\n<p>If you cannot escape otherwise, you can turn your back and flee as your Move. Often, Fleeing is involuntary, caused by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.kJNAY1YRaCy9IgmT]{Terror} or magic.</p>\n<p>If you flee, your opponent immediately gains 1 Advantage and may attempt 1 free attack. The free attack is an unopposed Melee Test using whatever weapon is currently held, using the SL scored to Damage you as normal. As you are throwing caution to the wind, your opponent gains +20 to hit you. If you are hit, your opponent gains +1 Advantage, and you must enact a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test: if failed, gain a Broken Condition, and a further +1 @Condition[Broken] condition per SL below 0.&nbsp; Once the free attack is concluded, you may move up to your Run Movement (see the Movement Table) directly away from your opponent, assuming you still can.</p>\n<h4>Running</h4>\n<p>On your turn, you can use your Action to sprint. This requires an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test, and the distance covered is in addition to your Move this round. You sprint your Run movement + SL in yards (see the Movement Table for your Run movement). So, a character with Move 4 who rolled –2 SL would sprint an additional 14 yards (16–2=14).</p>\n<h4>Climbing</h4>\n<p>Most climb moves won’t need Tests. Climbing rules are only required when the Climb is difficult or if knowing exactly how long you take to ascend is important.</p>\n<p>Climbing a ladder or similarly easy-to-climb surface does not require a Test but does slow you down. You move at half rate up or down ladders or other easily climbed surfaces. So, it would cost 4 yards of your Movement to climb a 2-yard ladder. If you want to climb more quickly, spend your Action to make an <strong>Average (+20) Climb</strong> Test. You will Climb an extra Movement + SL yards. So, a character with Movement 4 who rolled +2 SL will climb an additional 6 yards (4+2=6).</p>\n<p>If both hands are free, you can climb a surface with suitable handholds with a Climb Test using your Action for the turn. You ascend or descend at a rate of ½ Movement + SL in yards.</p>\n<p>Climbing difficulty is set by the GM and varies with the nature of the climbed surface. Some climbs will be beyond the ability of most characters without the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.MGEPI4jNhymNIRVz]{Scale Sheer Surface} Talent.</p>","_id":"m30a1XUH7PP976vi"}

I who learnt well the ways of the stylus, yea, and the scrolls of my forefathers, serve and shall ever serve the invincible King of Kings Amenemhetum, he who is called &ldquo;The Great.&rdquo; By his will have I this, my kingdom, carved red from the hands of the Green Races. For from my first step upon my lands, I have laid them low with my own sword; when all others fled in fear, I stepped forth to battle. Full 10,000 I slew with mine own blade. I who know no defeat have driven the Orcs before my war chariot. I who have fed Djaf, master of Jackals, a full 250,000 ears count this the least of my works, for does not Usirian, he whom we all adore, not gather up such with but one breath of his divine lungs?</p>\n<p>With my second step, full of the strength of Geheb&rsquo;s hounds, my legion, letting forth a great roar, rushed forth and slew full 20,000 barbarian men. I who flayed their pale skin earnt the love of Amenemhetum with this victory, and he raised me up. Thus I became King, and the backs of a full 100 savages was not enough to contain the map of my holdings.</p>\n<p>Thus with my third step, the peoples of my Kingdom did love me and called me deliverance and justice. Yea, and the spirit of yellow-eyed Basth moved within them, and they called that should I reign for a full 1000 years it would be too short a time. They named me Karitamen, the King that can not be killed, he that rolls victory before him like the beetles of the desert.</p>\n</blockquote>"}

Well, sometimes that end is a gruesome death… This is the Old World, and death is an old friend, around every corner, always ready to take you into Morr’s Realm.</p>\n<p>But the concept of Character death can be more complex than it first appears. For starters, a death can disrupt an ongoing story, or it can be disappointing to the Player whose Character has just carked it. In this section, we’re going to help you avoid these pitfalls.</p>\n<h3>Survival At A Cost</h3>\n<p>Whilst death should remain a real and present threat to Characters in<strong> WFRP</strong>, it is so unfortunately final. A Character’s death is the end of their story, and as such, is a source of drama only for those who survive. This is fine, but not as effective as the alternative: survival at a cost.</p>\n<p>GMs and Players alike should consider all of the tools available to prevent death whilst steering the story into new and challenging directions. Scars, permanent injuries and amputations, changing and traumatic @JournalEntry[Psychology]{Psychologies}, and @JournalEntry[Corruption]{Dark Deals} are all examples of evocative, Character-changing, and story-enhancing experiences. A Duellist who loses their primary arm to a stray cannonball and must now find a new way in the world is infinitely more interesting than a Duellist buried in the ground.</p>\n<h3>Embracing Character Death</h3>\n<p>There are a few instances where Character death is the most interesting thing that could happen to them. These moments should come with buy-in from the Player controlling that Character. In this case, a Player should feel empowered, if they so wish, to ignore their Fate Points, and accept that their Character’s story has come to an end. The three most obvious examples are: self-sacrifice, prophetic, and no-way-out deaths.</p>\n<h4>Self-sacrifice Deaths</h4>\n<p>When a Character has the chance to save the life of a friend by sacrificing their own, it is a pivotal moment in a Campaign. This is particularly effective if the bond between the Characters has been given emotional weight throughout the Campaign, as it represents an act that cannot be taken back. However, this is not recommended if the controlling Player still has stories they wish to tell with their Character.</p>\n<h4>Prophetic Deaths</h4>\n<p>Prophecies are everywhere in Warhammer, from the Doomings every Imperial child has delivered to them, to those whispered by seers and wizards the Old World over. If a Character is presented with a perfect moment to fulfill a prophecy which would result in them dying, it could be more thematically impactful if the Player accepts this fate. However, prophecies that prove to be wrong right at the last moment can also be sources of dramatic tension, so this can really go either way.</p>\n<h4>No-way-out Deaths</h4>\n<p>Sometimes the situation is so dire that you can’t imagine a way out. Whether your neck is on the chopping block, or a Slaaneshi cultist has a wicked blade to your throat, sometimes it’s better to accept that a Character made some wrong turns along the road of life. Often these sorts of deaths serve to tell a moral — don’t fight the law because the law will win, or don’t get into bed with the servants of She Who Thirsts. However, sometimes those morals need to be flipped on their heads to hammer home the theme — the law is corrupt and deserves to be fought! Don’t use this if you feel backed into a corner, but rather if you feel the death would be satisfying to the story. Even if there seems to be no way out, a spent Fate Point demands unusual and even impossible circumstances arising to save a Character.</p>\n<p>None of these methods work unless a Player wants them to, and ultimately, the decision is in their hands. There is a good reason why Characters have Fate Points to spend!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Options: Heroic Death</em></h3>\n<p><em>Characters who witness a heroic death, such as through self-sacrifice, are changed forever and that memory works to embolden their spirits in times of greater peril. When a Character encounters a situation similar to the heroic death, they gain a +20 bonus to Psychology Tests as they recall the heroic deed.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Daenar, seeing the inevitability of the on-coming Greenskin charge, and the perilous situation her companions are in, decides to hold them back long enough for the rest of her party to cross a rope bridge, cut it loose, and escape. Daenar stands her ground, draws her bow, and shouts at her companions to run. Months later, surrounded by Greenskins once more, Nils, Ezra, and Adelheidi recall the bravery of their fallen comrade, and are encouraged to press on because of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Introducing New Characters</h3>\n<p>When a Character dies, either heroically or hilariously, introducing the Player’s new Character to the existing party can be difficult, especially in the middle of an adventure. Here are a few tactics you can use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hired help</strong>. The party, recognising they’re missing an important piece, goes looking for someone to fill that niche. It just so happens the right (or perhaps only) person for the job is the new Character.</li>\n<li><strong>A friend in need</strong>. A beloved NPC is brought forward and becomes a full Character. If you need that Character to fulfill additional roles in the current adventure, either substitute in a different NPC for that role, or tell that Player what functions they need them to serve, and trust them to bring their own little twist.</li>\n<li><strong>We’re all in this together</strong>. If the Characters find themselves in a perilous situation — imprisoned or enslaved by their enemies, or running through the forest fleeing from whatever killed their friend — it’s easy to put bystanders or other adventuring types in the same situation. Nothing builds unity quite like a shared enemy, after all.</li>\n<li><strong>Reinforcements</strong>. If the Characters have a patron or an organisation who have employed them for their current mission, that employer can send along some needed reinforcements to get the job done.</li>\n<li><strong>Wait until the next adventure</strong>. Sometimes there’s no good way to jump straight into a new Character. If the next adventure isn’t far off — perhaps the next session — some Players may enjoy the chance to become a co-GM and take control of the Creatures the Characters fight, or to portray some of the cast of NPCs. This kind of change can even be seen as a consolation prize, or reward of sorts for losing a Character.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Doomings With 0 Fate</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Doomed Talent really takes centre stage when a Character falls to 0 Fate Points, because it’s no longer merely a string of words, but a prophecy which should terrify every Imperial soul. When this happens, you are encouraged to take that Character’s Dooming and attempt to manifest it in the world as much as possible, through both poetic and literal means. Not only does this increase the chances of a Character dying in a manner that matches their Dooming, and therefore increasing thematic cohesion in the story, but it also serves to spotlight that Character, and drive home the dread that is ever present in the Old World.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Nils has the Dooming ‘A kiss shall end thy days,’ and has recently fallen to 0 Fate Points after a nasty encounter with a hook-handed pirate. The GM takes this opportunity to have Marina, a revolutionary that Nils has been spending a lot of time with, grow increasingly emboldened. When the two of them light the fuse on a bomb set to blow up a shrine to the Chaos God Nurgle, Marina — fearing her life is about to be cut short — kisses Nils on the lips. Nils is now terrified even more so than he was already, and has to deal with this new awkwardness… if he doesn’t explode into little gobbets first.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Interpreting A Dooming</span></h3>\n<p><em>Perhaps the greatest thing about a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Dooming} is how very vague they’re worded despite how very important they are. These simple fragments of ‘wisdom’ are intended to guide a person’s whole life, as they spell out the moment of one’s death! Furthermore, there exists a great taboo in sharing one’s Dooming with another, so what may seem natural to one person would be inexplicably odd to another.</em></p>\n<p><em>Players and Characters should feel free to interpret their Dooming in whatever way they see fit, and should be encouraged to express that interpretation in hilarious ways. For example a Character with the Dooming ‘Trust not the innocence of children, for their plans are far from sound,’ may have an inherent aversion to children, or may feel a strong need to ignore and counteract anything a child says to them. They may take the Dooming literally, and believe that if their plans are ‘far from sound’, then plans involving sounds and noises are inherently trustworthy. Or potentially, if they can’t trust innocent children, maybe they can only trust guilty children, so they encourage the children they know to commit crimes!</em></p>\n<p><em>Remember that the majority of people in the Old World are both superstitious and very very skeptical, which makes for some ridiculous interpretations. Make sure to breathe some truth into their interpretations, but also to exploit other curious (and equally ridiculous) twists of your own.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"mzdy5QBboLSFoJRg"}

Here’s how to run a pursuit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Determine Distance </strong>— The GM decides how far ahead the pursued are from the pursuers, and assigns a number to represent the size of the head start, called the Distance. Typically, this will range from 1 for those almost in reach, to 4 for those with a good lead, to 8 for those almost beyond reach when the pursuit begins.</li>\n<li><strong>Test</strong> — Everyone actively moving in the pursuit rolls a Test for their movement — typically this will be a Drive, Ride, or Athletics Test depending upon the circumstances.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Update Distance</strong> — The lowest SL of the pursued and the highest SL of the pursuers is compared, the difference between these is added to the Distance if the pursued won, and subtracted from the Distance number if the pursuers won.</li>\n<li><strong>Determine Outcome</strong> — If the Distance falls to 0 or less, the pursuers have caught their quarry! The pursued can then sacrifice their slowest member that Round to delay the pursuers as the rest continue to flee, or they can stop and confront their pursuers. If the slowest of the pursued is abandoned, the pursuers decide who stops to confront the unfortunate and who continues in pursuit. If the poor abandoned runner is not a priority target it’s quite likely the pursuers will continue their pursuit of their target. If Distance reaches 10+, the pursuers have lost their quarry and the pursuit is over… for now! If the Distance is still 1–9, the pursuit continues, return to step 2.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As each Round passes, it’s important to describe what just happened in a fun and exciting fashion. If you score a large SL, describe people getting out of the way, giving you an opportunity to make ground. If you score a negative SL, describe tripping over crates, running into people, or slamming your coach against a wall, slowing you down.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong><em>: Eichengard and Sigrid are chasing three cultists through the streets of Altdorf. The cultists got a decent head start, so the GM gives him a lead of Distance 2. Each character rolls an Athletics Test to start the pursuit. Sigrid scores +3 SL;&nbsp; the cultists score +0, +2, and +2 SL; and Eichengard scores +2 SL.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>So, after the first round, the difference between the slowest cultist (0) and the fastest pursuing character (Sigrid with 3) is 3, meaning that the characters catch up with the cultists. The cowardly cultists abandon their slowest member in the hope of saving their hides, and Sigrid stops to subdue the abandoned aberrant.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Next round the cultists start at a Distance of 1 (the difference between the next slowest cultist and Sigrid last round) so Eichengard just needs to beat them by +1 SL to catch up again.</em></p>\n<h4>Movement Modifiers</h4>\n<p>If some of the characters in the pursuit have a higher Movement, they gain a bonus SL equal to the difference in Movement. So, if you had Move 5 and you were chasing a Move 4 character, you would gain +1 SL on your pursuit roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Perdita is urging her horse forwards, trying to chase down two Bandits. Her horse has Movement 8, where the Bandits are on Movement 7 and Movement 9 horses. Thus, the first Bandit has an unmodified Test, Perdita gains a bonus of +1 SL, and the second Bandit gains a bonus of +2 SL when they all roll their Ride (Horse) Tests.</em></p>","_id":"nD1AlGoGXY1bO8nS"}

It is located near the confluence of three rivers, the Ober, Tranig, and Teufel, each flowing from the distant @JournalEntry[UZCRHPMshLAiov0T]{Grey Mountains} into the shadows of the nearby @JournalEntry[ujGYMq3CDL3K8YSK]{Reikwald Forest}. The area of marshy lowland and stony hills south of this confluence is known as the Fleuchtschussel, a wet land infamous and avoided as the stormiest place in Reikland; even in midsummer, grey clouds smother the sun in a sky angry with rain and lightning.</p>\n<p><br />The town&rsquo;s population numbers fewer than seven hundred people. Neighbouring folk are puzzled that the entire population has not moved on to less damp climes before now, but there has been a settlement here before even Sigmar&rsquo;s time, and the people of Stromdorf have a profound sense of history and are proud of their town. They regard it as a mark of their tenacity that they survive in such an intemperate climate; however, other Reiklanders mock this outlook as proof of the townsfolks&rsquo; inbred imbecility. Stromdorf&rsquo;s inclement weather ensures few travellers tarry in the town, and hardly anyone settles there from elsewhere unless they have to. Thus, Stromdorf remains a backwater; it is an impoverished place when compared to the thriving settlements in the rest of the Reikland. It is no surprise that, like the sky that thunders above their heads, Stromdorfers are a stormy lot, quick to anger and difficult to placate. They complain bitterly about the smallest grievance, finding fault in everything except, oddly, the weather, which they habitually shrug off with heroic stoicism: &ldquo;Come now, it&rsquo;s only a bit of rain!&rdquo;</p>\n<p><br />One thing that visitors to Stromdorf may notice is that there are plenty of taverns for such a small town, and they are always brimming with folk. Also, children are almost always playing in the muddy streets , even though the constant drizzle means there is little to amuse most other locals outdoors. The high birth rate offsets the fact that many Stromdorfers end up early in Morr&rsquo;s Garden, victims of consumptive diseases caused by the wet climate. It is little wonder that outsiders tend to avoid the place.</p>","img":""}

Scarce becomes Rare; Rare becomes Exotic; and Exotic herbs cannot be found at all. Herbs may be located and identified using the&nbsp;<strong>Lore (Herbs)</strong>&nbsp;Skill, but most complex preparations require the&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Herbalist)</strong>&nbsp;Skill and a suitable set of trade tools to create a useful poultice. Draughts can be brewed using the&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Apothecary)</strong>&nbsp;Skill. Correctly prepared herbal treatments, or poisons, can be administered by almost anyone and rarely require any special skill.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc1\">New Endeavour: Foraging</h3>\n<p>Rather than relying on traders to procure herbs useful for the creation of poultices and draughts, those trained in the Lore (Herbs) skill may instead search for their own raw materials. This requires access to an area of the correct terrain &mdash; see the chart above for the locality in which specific herbs can be found. You may search any locality within a day&rsquo;s travel of your current location. You may only search for Herbs that are in season. Make an&nbsp;<strong>Average (+20) Lore (Herbs)</strong>&nbsp;Test.

Different herbs require differing preparations to extract their potential, while some herbs can simply be chewed, swallowed, or rubbed onto the skin to unlock their beneficial &mdash; or harmful &mdash; effects. Additionally, some herbs can have wildly different effects depending on how they are prepared. For example, an infusion of dried Valerian is said to neutralise the effects of an excess of alcohol, whereas the raw leaf induces mild nausea.</p>\n<p>The appropriate preparation for each herb is included in it&rsquo;s description, as is the Skill required to prepare it. Note that for any preparation with a harmful effect, the Skill&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Poisoner)</strong>&nbsp;may be used in place of other&nbsp;<strong>Trade</strong>&nbsp;Skills.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc3\">Poultices</h4>\n<p>Poultices are carefully prepared pastes, usually made by griding up plant matter and mixing it with carefully chosen oils or other liquids. These can be stored for up to a month before losing their effect, or in some cases becoming toxic. Poultices are usually applied topically, often using a bandage or other covering to prevent the patient from rubbing the treatment away. Poultices require the&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Herbalist)</strong>&nbsp;Skill to prepare.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc4\">Infusions</h4>\n<p>Infusions are essentially teas, a mix of herbs and other ingredients added to boiling water. The trick is in carefully drying the materials while preserving the herb&rsquo;s useful properties. Infusions are created using the&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Herbalist)&nbsp;</strong>Skill, and if stored correctly will last for years.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc5\">Draughts</h4>\n<p>Draughts are carefully brewed and distilled mixes of herbal ingredients, preservative fluids, and other, more arcane ingredients. They are created using the<strong>&nbsp;Trade (Apothecary)</strong>&nbsp;Skill, and a properly prepared draught in a well sealed glass vial or bottle will last for at least a year.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc6\">Raw</h4>\n<p>Raw preparations are exactly what they sound like - one simply chews, slathers on, or otherwise ingests the raw ingredient to benefit from it&rsquo;s effects. Occasionally ingredients may be cooked in some way, but this is usually to make them more palatable and has little other effect. Raw ingredients must be used while still fresh, and raw preparations rarely last more than a few days before they spoil. No special skill is required to prepare such treatments, though use of the&nbsp;<strong>Trade (Cook)&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;Trade (Poisoner)&nbsp;</strong>Skill allows a Character to disguise the taste of unpleasant ingredients, for good or ill.</p>\n<h3>Herbal Preparation Qualities</h3>\n<h4>Durable</h4>\n<p>The preparation's shelf-life is doubled for each Quality.</p>\n<h4>Fine</h4>\n<p>The preparation has a neutral or pleasing look, taste, or aroma that makes it harder to detect or less suspicious. The target suffers a -10 penalty per Quality to detect it.</p>\n<h4>Practical</h4>\n<p>Double the preparation's Duration or increase its intended effect by one increment (say, from 1 to 2 Poisoned Conditions or from +10 Intelligence to +20). Also, any Test to resist the effect suffers a -10 penalty.</p>\n<h4>Shoddy</h4>\n<p>The shelf-life of the preparation is halved, after which its properties become inert, with a 10% chance per Flaw of causing the Galloping Trots.</p>\n<h4>Ugly</h4>\n<p>The preparation has a distinctive odour, look, or taste, giving any target a +10 bonus per Flaw to detect it.</p>\n<h4>Unreliable</h4>\n<p>The preparation's effect is reduced by one increment per Flaw (so, 2 Poisoned Conditions become 1 Condition) or its Duration is halved. Also, any Test to resist the effect gains a +10 bonus.<span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Bold; font-size: 14pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Regular; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Bold; font-size: 14pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Regular; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Bold; font-size: 14pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Regular; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Bold; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Regular; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Italic; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: EBGaramond-Regular; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><br style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>"}
{"name":"The Aethyr","permission":{"default":0,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"SV4wmXUvuCNwQ0Nc","sort":200001,"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"Magic"}},"content":"<p>Magical abilities mark you as a figure of terror and awe in the Empire. Prior to the establishment of the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, those able to wield magic were reviled outlaws. Nowadays being a witch is not illegal, but casting magic without a licence is. Spellcasters within the Empire must either study at the Colleges of Magic, refrain from casting spells, or hope no-one notices their illicit activity. Even licenced wizards are generally feared and avoided &mdash; legal status has done nothing to reduce the superstitious dread of the common folk.</p>\n<p>Magic is seen as unnatural and is notorious for its darker elements: the crippling hexes of witchcraft, the raising of the dead, and the summoning of Daemonic entities. Even when practiced according to the teaching of the Colleges, magic can be the cause of trouble. The very source of magic is unstable, and even the most experienced spellcaster can lose focus, resulting in dangerous accidents and unexpected side-effects.</p>\n<h2>THE AETHYR</h2>\n<p>Scholars of magic derive their learning from the Elves, who explained the source of all magical power is the Aethyr. This infinite dimension, said to be the spawning ground of daemons and spirits, exists beyond the physical world. The Elves taught that far to the north of the Empire, a great ragged wound was torn through the fabric of the world to the Aethyr, and it bleeds raw magic. These roiling energies &mdash; known as the Winds of Magic &mdash; blow throughout the world, gathering and eddying in great heavenly whorls, only to rain down and permeate the land and the creatures dwelling upon it. It is these powerful winds that wizards and witches use to fuel their spells.</p>\n<h3>The Winds Of Magic</h3>\n<p>As magical power bursts into the mortal realm and sweeps down from the north, it splinters and separates, like light splitting through a prism. The Colleges of Magic state this creates eight discrete Winds referred to by colour, each with its own character and strengths. The Elves support this, teaching the same eight winds to their apprentices before moving on to more powerful magics.</p>\n<p>Only a small minority of Humans can perceive the Winds, and even fewer can bend them to their will. Most Elves are sensitive to them, and many possess the ability to see the Winds clearly &mdash; commonly known as Second Sight, or just the Sight &mdash; with many also able to learn how to cast magic. Dwarfs disdain magic, perhaps because they are partially immune to it, and no Dwarf wizards are known. Halflings are largely indifferent towards magic: except when it delivers impressive or entertaining spectacles.</p>\n<p>The Elves directed (as a condition of their tuition) that Human spellcasters should each only use a single Wind of Magic. They argued that while it is possible to cast spells by drawing from multiple winds, doing so is a risky proposition for the feeble, corruptible Human mind. This wisdom has been adopted by the Colleges, and each specialises in a single colour.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some witches outside the College system consider these restrictions ludicrous, an attempt by the Elves to keep the most powerful magics to themselves. Drawing on multiple winds is a quick route to power, but also to damnation. Many an unlicensed witch has proved unable to resist this temptation, a practice usually called Dark Magic, only to be brought low by Witch Hunters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Others believe magical energies are not so easily categorised. Many different types of &lsquo;wizard&rsquo; and &lsquo;witch&rsquo; can be found throughout the Old World, with some practicing magic that seems to lie outside colour magic, such as the cold-hearted Ice Witches of Kislev, or the shamans and sorcerers found amongst some of the other species besetting the Empire, such as the Greenskins.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>What Is The Aethyr?</em></h3>\n<p><em>There is much heated debate between &lsquo;experts&rsquo; on the nature of magic. The lecture halls of the Empire&rsquo;s most learned institutions often see ambitious scholars expound on their latest theories. Some liken magic to the backstage of a theatre, a mass of mechanisms, props, and hidden pulleys responsible for the drama viewed by the audience. Others resort to mathematical metaphors, complete with incomprehensible esoteric diagrams. Although such may end with an air of confident finality, it will only be met with polite coughs, raised hands, and a litany of objections and exceptions.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Language of Magic</h3>\n<p>The Winds of Magic may blow through all things incessantly, but they are relatively harmless until harnessed by the Language of Magick. For reasons not fully understood, when certain sounds are uttered by those attuned to magic, the Winds answer. The Colleges of Magic teach a complex language called the lingua praestantia which form the basis of their spells, originally taught to Humanity by the Elves. Although extraordinarily difficult to correctly annunciate, it is a significant simplification of the Elven tongue Anoqey&aring;n , the language used by the Elves to shape their own, more powerful magics. Wizards of the Colleges and the Elves are not alone in their knowledge of the Language of Magick. Its complex forms are also spoken by many magical creatures found across the Old World, including Spirits and Daemons. Many witches seem to instinctively understand the language, almost as if it somehow wormed inside them, begging to be spoken as a spell.</p>\n<h3>The Eight Lores</h3>\n<p>Each of the eight Winds of Magic has an associated Lore, a body of spells and knowledge its adepts use. Each of the eight Colleges of Magic is dedicated to the study of a single Lore, and their buildings are constructed to focus their Wind to facilitate relatively safe tuition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Lore of Light]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Lore of Metal]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Lore of Life]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Lore of Heavens]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Lore of Shadows]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Lore of Death]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Lore of Fire]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Lore of Beasts]</p>\n<h3>Elven Magic</h3>\n<p>Elves are long lived beings whose minds are more attuned to the workings of magic than those of humanity. High Elven mages usually train in several, sometimes all, of the eight winds as part of their apprenticeships, before the most promising move on to study High Magic: Qhaysh . This is the blending of multiple winds of magic together into a blinding, coruscating energy. This magic is impressive and difficult, and Elves claim it is beyond the capacity of humankind.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Wood Elves, too, make use of the eight Winds of Magic, though their Spellsingers usually focus upon the Jade and Amber Winds. The most powerful usually go on to study either High Magic like High Elves, or dread Dark Magic &ndash; a foul mixing of the eight winds that can create tremendously destructive effects.</p>\n<h3>Dark Magic</h3>\n<p>While difficult to master Qhaysh is the safe blending of multiple Winds of Magic, Dhar , known commonly as Dark Magic, is much more dangerous method of casting spells using multiple winds. It is usually only practiced by evil sorcerers, Necromancers, and powerful witches, offering them a seductive source of raw power, yet one laced with terrible side-effects. Few can channel Dhar for long, without succumbing to the corrupting influence of the malevolent wind, their bodies and minds being warped into unnatural states.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dhar resembles a stagnant mire to those with the Sight, pooling in places saturated with evil, or corruption: the herdstones of Beastmen, the dark idols of chaos cultists, and places where great workings of several of the Winds of Magic took place. Dhar is so dense and potent that it can independently coalesce or crystalize into physical matter, eventually forming the widely feared substance called warpstone.</p>\n<h4>Warpstone</h4>\n<p>Warpstone is a lump of pure magic in the material plane. Its unnatural provenance is immediately obvious to all who see it, as it hurts the eyes and mutates anything drawing close for too long. Although its form varies, it often holds hard facets like flint, and radiates a queasy green glow.</p>\n<p>Close examination of the substance is not to be undertaken lightly. Warpstone is the stuff of Chaos made manifest and its presence is deeply corrupting. Those who have direct contact with warpstone risk illness, madness and mutation, and anyone who ingests so much as a pinch of the stuff dooms themselves to catastrophic warping of body and mind. Nonetheless, the world is full of reckless, ambitious fools who know that the volatile and dangerous substance is a tremendous source of energy for spells and rituals.</p>\n<p>The followers of Chaos and the Skaven do not hesitate to use it. To them, warpstone is a literal gift from the gods to be valued above gold and jewels, and to be used against their enemies.</p>\n<h3>Other Lores</h3>\n<p>In less frequented corners of the Empire, in villages and rural communities far from the influence of the Colleges of Magic, older forms of magic are still practiced even though they are outlawed and punishable by death. There are uncounted varieties of these, but two of the more common Lores still practised by Humans are Hedgecraft and Witchcraft.</p>\n<h4>The Lore of Hedgecraft</h4>\n<p>Practitioners of Hedgecraft generally live quiet lives on the fringes of smaller human settlements, in service to local communities. Just as they live their lives in the &lsquo;hedge&rsquo; between civilisation and the wilds of nature, so much of their magic concerns itself with the liminal space between the material world and the realm of the spirits.&nbsp; Their magic tends to focus on folklore, spirits and the natural world, as well as means to aid the rural communities which shelter them. Once a relatively common sight in the Empire, over two centuries of persecution since the founding of the Colleges of Magic has all but wiped them out.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>The Lore of Witchcraft</h4>\n<p>While the Lore of Witchcraft is not inherently malicious, or tied to the gods of Chaos, it has a justly earned reputation for evil and unpleasantness. Often self-taught and using multiple Winds of Magic, those practising the Lore of Witchcraft lack the discipline or knowledge of College wizards and are at a significant risk of corruption. The combination of the corrosive effects of Dhar and being shunned by right-minded folk of the Empire often makes these Witches bitter, spiteful souls, their hearts hard and flinty, their gaze baleful and ill-omened.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/winds.webp","_id":"qVvyEmzXHO3AjkmS"}

They have a long history of rivalry with one another, and at more than one point in Altdorf&rsquo;s recent history this rivalry has erupted into riotous violence.</p>\n<h2>What has happened here?</h2>\n<p>Tarwin Fleisher, a member of the Fish gang, has stolen a goblin from a group of Tileans who were due to deliver it to the university of Altdorf. With the help of some fellow Fish he broke into the warehouse and, using a leash and goad, forced the goblin to stand amongst some crates.</p>\n<p>Karl Fuchs, the caretaker, turned up and spotted the goblin in the morning, and then ran to get help. Tarwin bound the goblin up again and fled the scene.</p>\n<p>To the delight of the Fish Karl embellished his story, claiming the encounter was much more dramatic than it was, and the Hooks have called the Watch rather than trying to deal with it themselves. This plays right into the hands of the Fish, who can mock their rivals for being cowards, point out to their customers that they have greenskins in their warehouse, and accuse them of wasting Watch time when it turns out that there is nothing there.</p>\n<p>Tarwin bludgeoned the goblin and dropped it in a sewer, he then returned to the scene of the crime to gloat as the Watch investigate the incident.</p>\n<h2>Meeting Tarwin</h2>\n<p>As the Watch arrive at the Hook wharf they will spot a group of Dockers stood a little distance from the Hook workers gathered around the warehouse. Unlike the Hooks, who seem uncomfortable and&nbsp; embarrassed on the whole, these Dockers wear beaming smiles and regularly nudge each other in order to share a whispered spiteful remark.</p>\n<p>As the PCs make their way to Hooks the ringleader of this group steps forward and declares: <em>&ldquo;Gettin&rsquo; the coppers involved over some vermin are you lads? I&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve fort big brave &lsquo;Ooks&rsquo;d be able to sort saach matters aht themselves.&rdquo;</em> He is a tall and heavily built man with a shaved head and an expression indicating a cheerfully violent disposition. He wears a large black leather coat with an intricate design of a Fish painted across the back. If the PCs talk to Tarwin he will be cooperative with them, introduce himself freely and assure them that he isn&rsquo;t the sort to make trouble. If a PC recalls that this flies in the face of his comments to the Altdorf Speiler Tarwin will laugh and say <em>&ldquo;I was just &lsquo;avin&rsquo; a laugh wiv that giggling inkie reporter creep, you gotta try an&rsquo; give &lsquo;em good copy ain&rsquo;t ya?&rdquo;</em> He will then be somewhat reticent to talk further, asked if there is a reason why he thinks Draygo a creep Tarwin will say that he has a<em> &ldquo;gurly laugh&rdquo;</em> and that he&rsquo;s always hanging about with <em>&ldquo;that runty mate of &lsquo;is&rdquo;</em>.</p>\n<h2>Meeting the Hooks</h2>\n<p>Around the warehouse is a small group of Dockers, and one of their number is an elderly man who looks as if he has had a bad scare. This is Karl Fuchs, he used to be a member of an Imperial Free Company and saw action against an Orc army, which has left him with a phobia of greenskins. He is still ashamed of having run from a goblin though, and is trying to make the encounter out to be more dramatic than it actually was. If asked what happened he will say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;I were just giving the warehouse a quick once over in the morning, right, when I heard this deep growl from behind some crates, and when I look up to see what&rsquo;s there this great big greenskin leaps out. Huge it was, but all bent over and bandy, great hands dragging on the floor, massive horned helmet balanced on it&rsquo;s ugly skull. It looked at me and roared. I thought about taking it on myself, like, but then I reckoned it would be better to get the authorities involved, after all there might be more than one.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Searching the Warehouse</h2>\n<p>If the Watch search the warehouse they find one of the following clues for each successful search test.</p>\n<p>&bull; A pile of evil-smelling dung.</p>\n<p>&bull; A sharpened stick with some green blood smeared upon it.</p>\n<p>&bull; A spattered line of green blood drops that lead to a window that has been left partly open.</p>\n<p>&bull; A scrap of black leather caught on one of the catches used to secure the window.</p>\n<p>The scrap of leather matches a part torn out of Tarwin&rsquo;s coat. Faced with this Tarwin and his cronies will beat a retreat, and try to violently resist arrest.</p>"}
{"_id":"rLOdOAfi1e4IDbw4","name":"The Emperor Wilhelm","permission":{"default":0,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"sJsgXlZiMioDgTqH","sort":100001,"flags":{},"content":"<p>The Emperor Luitpold is a luxury river liner, named after the father and predecessor of Karl-Franz I. Run by the large and powerful Hindelin Lines of Altdorf, it plies the River Talabec from Altdorf to Bechafen near the Worlds Edge Mountains. Built by the Spee boatyards in Altdorf in 2510, the Luitpold and its sister-ships the Emperor Wilhelm (Altdorf&ndash;Nuln) and the Emperor Magnus (Altdorf&ndash;Marienburg) give Hindelin Lines an unrivalled luxury fleet. The &lsquo;Imperial-class&rsquo; river liners are much favoured by wealthy merchants, those on Imperial business and the lesser nobility.</p>\n<p>The Emperor Luitpold has two passenger decks; the upper passenger deck holds eight luxury staterooms and 14 threeberth servants&rsquo; cabins, while the lower holds 16 twin-berth luxury passenger cabins. Fares are as follows.</p>\n<p>The fares cover the cabin plus three meals a day. All other services &mdash; drinks and snacks during the day, for instance &mdash; are &lsquo;extras&rsquo;, and a bill for these is presented at journey&rsquo;s end.</p>\n<p>The captain has the discretion to discount fares en route but is forbidden by company regulations to offer a discount of more than 10% on the full fare. If all passenger cabins are full, they may offer passengers any spare servants&rsquo; cabins at the servants&rsquo; fare.</p>\n<p>Passenger and servants&rsquo; cabins may be equipped with an extra folding bunk on request, but only if all other cabins of the same class are full. There is a 25% surcharge for this service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Journey</h2>\n<p>The Emperor Luitpold&rsquo;s downstream journey starts at Berghafen, a small town on the upper Talabec a few miles beyond the edge of the forest; this is the highest point on the Talabec which can be reached by large river traffic. By transferring to smaller craft and then to mules, it is possible to follow the Upper Talabec all the way to the Dwarfholds of Karak-Kadrin and Karak-Ungor.</p>\n<p>There are few regular stops along the first part of the route, mainly for fresh supplies, but the Emperor Luitpold will stop to pick up and set down passengers as required. Flagpoles are set up on wharves along the route to signal the boat to stop for passengers. Once the Emperor Luitpold reaches Talabhelm, the journey becomes more regular. The boat always stops at Ahlenhof and Schoppendorf, and often at Volgen as well.</p>\n<p>The Emperor Luitpold&rsquo;s combination of sails and oars makes it a rapid means of travel. Its 750-mile trip takes around 2 weeks downstream and 2 &frac12; weeks upstream: an average of 45 and 38 miles per day respectively.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Rules of Passage</h2>\n<p>All the laws of the Empire apply aboard the Emperor Luitpold. For legal purposes, the liner is treated as being within the jurisdiction of the legal authorities of Altdorf. There are also certain rules which passengers are expected to observe while on board:</p>\n<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> All passengers are permitted to carry one sword and one dagger while on board. All other weapons &mdash; including hand weapons other than swords, unless the passenger can plead a special case &mdash; and all armour must be handed over to the purser for safe-keeping in the liner&rsquo;s strongroom, although they are available on request if passengers want them for shore visits along the way, or in the event of the liner being attacked.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic:</strong> Spellcasting of any kind is forbidden on board without the express permission of the captain. This includes the use of magical items. In practice, this rule is difficult to enforce, but anyone openly casting spells will be reported to the captain.</p>\n<p><strong>Morality:</strong> All passengers are expected to observe &lsquo;common decency&rsquo;. Basically, this means not doing anything in public which is liable to shock, offend, embarrass or outrage one&rsquo;s fellow passengers. The captain is the final judge of such matters.</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Observance:</strong> After dinner each day, the captain leads the company and passengers in a five-minute period of prayers to Sigmar, Ulric, and Taal. Attendance is not compulsory, but those who do not take part are considered impolite (Fellowship Tests become one step more difficult when dealing with any member of the crew).</p>\n<p>Passengers are free to make any observances demanded by their particular religions, subject to the laws of the Empire, but animal sacrifice of any kind on board is banned. Passengers who flout the rules of passage will be given one warning, except in extreme cases. The captain has the power to put offenders off at the next stop, handing them over to the local authorities if Imperial laws are broken.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>A Typical Day</h2>\n<p>A day aboard the Emperor Luitpold revolves around mealtimes. Breakfast is served an hour after dawn, lunch at noon, and dinner at 7pm. Mealtimes are announced by the boat&rsquo;s stewards, who walk the length of the passenger deck ringing small handbells. Meals are served in the passenger lounge, but passengers may arrange to take some or all meals in their cabins. No charge is made for this, but a tip of at least 5/&ndash; per person per meal is customary. Between meals, the passengers are left largely to their own devices. The passenger lounge is closed for 20 minutes before and after each meal as the stewards convert it from a dining-room back to a lounge, clearing away the folding tables and so on.</p>\n<p>Light meals and water is available in the passenger lounge throughout the day, and wines and spirits are served from noon till midnight, though ales are only normally available on board if the crew has had prior notice of a Dwarf dignitary travelling, or if a paying stateroom passenger has specifically requested they be available. These are all &lsquo;extras&rsquo; and must normally be paid for at the time, although a request for an account, to be settled at the end of the trip, is seldom refused. The Emperor Luitpold has a bill of fare comparable to that of a high-class restaurant in a large Imperial city, both in range and price.</p>\n<p>During the day, various deck games are available for those who wish to play, and weapons practice and friendly duels (to first blood) are permitted on the promenade deck by prior arrangement. Those wishing to engage in friendly competition must inform the captain or purser before any fight. If the crew are not aware of any prior arrangement, they will treat the incident as a common brawl and step in to restrain the combatants.</p>\n<p>After dinner, entertainments are staged in the passenger lounge: it is common, for example, for a musician or other entertainer to work his passage in return for a reduced fare. The standard fare reduction is 50% and is not subject to negotiation. A Character wishing to strike this kind of deal must make a successful Difficult (&ndash;10) Perform or Play Test, modified as follows for each of the listed skills:</p>\n<p>You can derive modifiers for other specialisations following this pattern. Anything involving fire is banned since the Emperor Luitpold is built almost entirely of wood. Animal acts are not generally acceptable, since an unfortunate incident three years ago involving a dancing bear, and more &lsquo;refined&rsquo; arts and instruments are favoured over more &lsquo;rustic&rsquo; or &lsquo;vulgar&rsquo; entertainments. No entertainment may include material that is insulting to the Emperor, the nobility, or any of the major religions, or which is in any way &lsquo;in bad taste&rsquo; (as decided by the captain). These rules are explained to every entertainer at the outset, and any breach results in the captain disallowing part or all of an entertainer&rsquo;s discount. If an offending Character protests that he or she cannot pay the full fare, the captain hints darkly that they have contacts on the staff of the notorious Mundsen Keep debtors&rsquo; prison in Altdorf.</p>"}
{"name":"Social Status and Standing","permission":{"default":0,"rV2mzxh8yjNgvo3g":3,"hNHeJbKl47AOkoOO":3},"folder":"5lgcrfb3I58JxD8Y","sort":500001,"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"initialization-folder":"GM's Guide"}},"content":"<p>The rules regarding @JournalEntry[Status] are an incredible tool for building context and theme in your Campaigns. A Character’s Status often says more about their world than Class or Career, as it shapes their likely peers, living arrangements, and the logistics of their everyday lives. The following pages are set aside to expand those rules and give advice on how to use them.</p>\n<h3>Costs of Living</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[The Cost of Living] states that a Character is expected to spend approximately half their Status and Standing every day to maintain appearances, and that even this exorbitant amount is considered ‘frugal living.’&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whilst this number seems potentially prohibitive for Brass and Silver Statuses, when it comes to Gold Status, it is outright extortionate! And yet, these numbers reflect a very real situation for transient people, such as Warhammer Characters.</p>\n<p>Firstly, it’s worth remembering that a Character doesn’t begin to lose Standing until they’ve spent a week living beneath their expected expenses. However, recovering Standing requires this spending every single day for a week to regain one point. It’s easier to maintain a facade than to build one.</p>\n<p>These systems are in place to create an urgency to adventure. The Characters are not typical examples of their Careers, but rather desperate and extraordinary. Their lives exist in a state of constant change that few in the Empire enjoy (or suffer) by virtue of being the focus of our attention at the table. This need to spend money constantly results in a need to earn money — a lot of money — frequently as well, meaning Characters are more likely to take risks, bet on the wrong Middenball team, involve themselves in shady business, and meet dramatic fates. That is one of the central tensions built into the Warhammer world, and one of your greatest tools to exploit when building adventures.</p>\n<h3>Changing Status</h3>\n<p>A Character’s Standing is often in flux, and the folk of the Old World change their Standing often — by the whims of the Gods, the seasons, and through hard work. But changing one’s Status is rather perilous. It is a fundamental threat to the social order of the Empire. The growing middle class directly threatens the existence of the nobility, and in turn the place in the pecking order of favoured peasants. As such, few people look kindly on social climbers, and there is often a host of issues that comes along with increasing or decreasing one’s Status.</p>\n<p>As the GM, it’s your job to reinforce the central conflicts in the Warhammer world, and one of the starkest is the class struggle that underpins everything in the Empire. To reinforce this, consider not just how NPCs not of a Character’s current Status perceive them, but also those of their new and old Statuses after changing Careers. Old friends may now regard the Characters as out of touch or snobby, whilst new peers may see them as uppity or possibly admirable — having ‘pulled themselves up by their bootstraps’. Characters who drop Status may find themselves surrounded by people who consider the Character ‘too big for their britches’, and other such derogatory phrases.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that the Empire, despite how it might seem, is steadfastly not a meritocracy — that is, the best person for the job isn’t always, or even often, the one who fills it. Privilege is everywhere in the Empire, and no one gets to high places alone. Consider who around the Characters may resent them for their rise (small as it may be), or who see them as their own ticket up the social ladder. Use these class struggles as an opportunity for the world to change around the Characters, and in turn for the Character to change their world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Options: Transitional Status</span></h3>\n<p><em>Changing Status and Standing in the Old World is more difficult than merely finding a new job. To reflect this, you might have achieving new Status and Standing be a gradual process, counting a Career’s stated Status and Standing as its upper limit, rather than its new default.</em></p>\n<p><em>When a Character changes Careers, the Status and Standing of their new Career is their upper limit, rather than their new default, with their current Status and Standing remaining where it was. Characters must act according to the rules laid out in @JournalEntry[Status]{Keeping Up Appearances} to raise their Status to its new maximum.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Tapping Communities</h3>\n<p>A Character’s peers are often the first place they’ll want to go to find out information about their current Adventures, future opportunities, or just general gossip. As such, it’s a good idea to create a small cast of NPCs in any locale that the Characters will spend their time in who reflect the attitude and temperaments of the three Statuses. These NPCs can act as the mouth-pieces of their communities, as well as key contacts for the Characters as they inhabit those spaces.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if a locale includes members of certain restricted classes — represented through the Etiquette Talent — they should have their own NPC. Consider how these NPCs may overlap: perhaps a village has three NPCs of each Status, and two Criminal NPCs, one Brass and one Gold. What does this say about the nature of crime in the community? What does this mean for the Characters moving through it?</p>\n<p>Encourage your Players to have their Characters consort primarily with their own communities, and then come together to share that knowledge. Each community will have different things they know about, care about, and can act on. Gold NPCs may be able to manipulate the courts or local State Army, whilst Servant communities likely have more personal noble gossip — because they spend so much time with nobles, who barely notice that they exist.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>‘We Don’t Serve Your Kind’</em></h3>\n<p><em>Whilst upper class types might think they rule the Old World, the realities of the Empire’s cities and towns is far different. It’s certainly true that a Brass Status individual would have a hard time getting into a palace, a Gold Status patron might find themselves uncomfortable in a seedy docker’s pub.</em></p>\n<p><em>In this way, places and situations can have a Status as well, and even have an @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette} Social Group attached to them, though these are only reserved for special scenes. When present, any NPCs who match the location’s Status count as being subject to a @JournalEntry[Psychology] against non-members.</em></p>\n<p><em>If the space includes an Etiquette that the Character lacks, count their Status as one step removed, in either direction, for the purposes of the above.

It stands proudly at the conﬂuence of the mighty @JournalEntry[The Reik]{Reik} and Talabec rivers, as well as at the end of many major trade routes, and is easily the wealthiest city in the Empire. This ensures it is always expanding and renewing, with fresh, wide-eyed hopefuls arriving daily, and more commissions for new bridges, buildings, and engineering marvels presented weekly to the city&rsquo;s burgomeisters than most cities consider in a year.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Today, Altdorf is a city of steam-powered bridges, mismatched islands, enormous tenements, and seemingly endless hordes of people: one cannot traverse its crooked streets without becoming intimately familiar with complete strangers. Because it draws merchants and diplomats from across the Known World, it is also surprisingly cosmopolitan; not only do folk of all ranks, races, creeds, and backgrounds rub shoulders freely, but even wizards are a common sight, rarely receiving more hostility than a wary glance or muttered blessing.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Always surprising outsiders, a populous Elf quarter thrives near the Reiksport &mdash; Altdorf &rsquo;s deep-water harbour and shipyard &mdash; founded by High Elf merchant princes trading up the Reik from Marienburg over a century ago. The old alliance between the Empire and Dwarfs has stood since Sigmar&rsquo;s time and ensures many Dwarf clans also reside there in tight-knit communities, some having toiled on the city&rsquo;s stonework for untold generations, though naturally their stubborn natures preclude them from ever calling Altdorf home. There is even a healthy Halﬂing population, with most earning their crusts serving fine food and better ales in Altdorf &rsquo;s hostelries, many of which are guarded by the city&rsquo;s sizeable Ogre population. Even odder creatures also call the city home, with none more fantastic than those found in the Imperial Zoo, which boasts myriad monsters and animals including the Abomination of Stirland and the Drakwald Gibberbeast, each caged and displayed for the amusement of all.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">This enormous and varied population helps secure one of Altdorf&rsquo;s more notorious traits: it is infamously smelly, known aﬀectionately, and all too accurately, as &lsquo;The Great Reek&rsquo;. During the hot, summer months the stench rolling in from the @JournalEntry[Altdorf Flats] grows so potent that many of the city&rsquo;s wealthiest citizens ﬂee to country estates or the sumptuous, sun-kissed palaces of Grenstadt in Southern Averland.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">The ever-present fetor does little to ease Altdorf&rsquo;s citizenry, a mob known for being uniquely vocal and prone to rioting at any imagined slight, especially if it involves new taxes. Even seemingly trivial actions of the local burgomeisters and nobles can earn their ire; but the fact that many of their protests are entirely fair does not lessen the crown&rsquo;s fervor in quashing any rebellious rabbles that may take to the streets.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Altdorf is also a renowned centre for learning. The sons and daughters of wealthy households matriculate at the University of Altdorf, often with little regard to academic ability; those with scholarly potential, but without the financial clout to match it, often find their way to the High Temple of Verena, for the Goddess of Wisdom always has space for those blessed with intellect. The famed Imperial Engineers&rsquo; School &mdash; founded by Tilean genius Leonardo da Miragliano &mdash; also lies within Altdorf &rsquo;s walls. Here some of the Empire&rsquo;s bravest, and most reckless, souls devise new and inventive methods for raining fiery death on the enemies of mankind. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the school has been rebuilt over a dozen times since it was founded.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Arguably the most significant educational institution in Altdorf is also its most mysterious: The Colleges of Magic. Founded over two centuries ago at the behest of Emperor Magnus the Pious, the colleges are guided by the principles and precepts of the elven Loremaster Teclis. The colleges are charged with training magically gifted citizens to channel their dangerous talents in the defence of the Empire. Rumours of the warping inﬂuence of the potent magical energies gathered by so many wizards living in such close proximity persist; allegedly the very streets of the capital have been twisted, and certain college buildings are believed to be hidden from all but those few blessed &mdash; or should that be cursed &mdash; with witchsight, but few believe such talk.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\">Standing in stark contrast to the arcane mysteries of the Colleges of Magic, and as a bulwark against any errant witches or rogue magisters, Altdorf is also the beating heart of the Cult of Sigmar. Over two-thousand five-hundred years ago, Sigmar was born, raised, and eventually crowned as first emperor within the boundaries of modern Altdorf, and fttingly the city now boasts more Sigmarite temples and holy sites than all the other cities of the Empire combined. Indeed, it is often said that one cannot throw a heretic without hitting a temple of Sigmar in the city.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</p>\n</div>","img":""}

It will be sacked many times by rival tribes, Beastmen, Orcs, Goblins, and other vile creatures. Nevertheless, the site is strategically important at the confluence of the Reik and Talabec, and a mixture of conquest and trade helps the settlement flourish. Soon, scholars claim, the fortified town is known as the &lsquo;rich village&rsquo;, or Reichsdorf. As centuries pass, this becomes Reikdorf, with the surrounding land called the Reikland.</p>\n<h3>-30 IC</h3>\n<p>A twin-tailed comet streaks through the sky, heralding the birth of Sigmar to Chief Bj&ouml;rn of the Unberogen tribe in Reikdorf. The comet leads a crazed warparty of Orcs to Sigmar&rsquo;s birthplace, and his mother, Griselda, is killed in the attack, leaving Sigmar with a life-long hatred of Greenskins.</p>\n<h3>-15 IC</h3>\n<p>A merchant-train from Karaz-a-Karak is ambushed by Orcs, and they capture King Kurgan Ironbeard. Sigmar rescues the king, and in return is named a dawonger, Dwarf-friend, and given the king&rsquo;s greatest heirloom, the magical warhammer Ghal-Maraz.</p>\n<h3>-8 IC</h3>\n<p>After his father dies, Sigmar becomes chief of the Unberogen tribe.</p>\n<h3>-7 IC</h3>\n<p>Sigmar realises the threat the Greenskins pose is far too much for his tribe to tackle alone, so he starts a campaign to bring all the surrounding Human tribes under his rule.</p>\n<h3>-2 IC</h3>\n<p>After several years of warfare and diplomacy, Sigmar binds twelve of the human tribes under his rule and allies himself with several more.</p>\n<h3>-1 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The First Battle for Black Fire Pass</em>. The largest horde of Orcs and Goblins the world has seen is defeated by Humans and Dwarfs led by High Chief Sigmar and King Kurgan, ending the centuries-long Goblin Wars.</p>\n<h3>0 IC</h3>\n<p>Sigmar is crowned emperor over the chiefs of the twelve tribes and the Empire is born. The Dwarf Runesmith Alaric the Mad is commissioned to create twelve runeswords, one for each of the tribal chiefs, as a symbol of their office and&nbsp;as thanks for their sacrifices to end the Goblin Wars.</p>\n<h3>1 IC&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><em>The First War Against Chaos</em>. The newly founded Empire is attacked by the forces of Morkar the Uniter, Everchosen of Chaos. The war is desperate, short, and devastating. Eventually, Morkar is slain by Sigmar in a day-long battle that was said to have split the earth and rent the sky.</p>\n<h3>c. 2 IC</h3>\n<p>Sigmar names the twelve tribal chiefs his &lsquo;counts&rsquo;, which modern scholars claim can be sourced in the Classical word comes, meaning &lsquo;companion&rsquo;, for they were his companions on the battlefield against the Greenskins and against the Chaos tribes from the north.</p>\n<h3>c. 7 IC</h3>\n<p>Sigmar kills the Necromancer Morath and takes the Crown of Sorcery. Recognising its evil, Sigmar locks it away beneath Reikdorf.</p>\n<h3>11 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Battle of Drakenmoor</em>. The Great Enchanter, Constant Drachenfels, leads an army of Goblins and Daemons against Sigmar&rsquo;s new capital and suffers the first defeat of his eternal existence. This shocking loss will haunt him long after he reincorporates several centuries later.</p>\n<h3>15 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Battle of the River Reik</em>. Nagash, the Lord of Undeath, gathers a shambling horde of unliving monsters, and attempts to claim the Crown of Sorcery from Sigmar. The Undead almost overwhelm the Reiklanders and their Dwarf allies, but, after an exhausting battle, Sigmar eventually strikes Nagash down, causing the unliving army to crumble to dust.</p>\n<h3>50 IC</h3>\n<p>After five decades of extraordinary rule, Sigmar vanishes. To avoid destroying Sigmar&rsquo;s empire, the tribal chiefs eventually agree to vote for&nbsp;a new emperor from their own number, and select Siegrich of the Asoborn tribe. Thus, the counts became &lsquo;elector counts&rsquo;, and each swears to be a companion and protector of their elected emperor.</p>\n<h3>51 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Siegrich I dies in a hunting accident. After a fraught month, Prince Hedrich of the Unberogens is elected Emperor Hedrich I, bringing the seat of the Empire back to Reikdorf.</p>\n<h3>69 IC</h3>\n<p>Johann Helstrum arrives in Reikdorf and claims to have holy visions concerning Sigmar. He preaches that he witnessed Sigmar&rsquo;s Ascension to Godhood. Such is the love the Unberogens have for their lost emperor, Helstrum is readily believed.</p>\n<h3>73 IC</h3>\n<p>Johann Helstrum builds a temple to Sigmar in Reikdorf. History will forever remember him as the first Grand Theogonist of&nbsp;</p>\n<p>the Cult of Sigmar, and the first man to recognise Sigmar&rsquo;s divinity.</p>\n<h3>c. 100 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Hedrich I receives the twelve runeblades from Alaric the Mad that were commissioned 100 years earlier. Each of these &lsquo;Runefangs&rsquo; is a unique weapon of extraordinary power, and they are passed to the tribal chiefs. In time, the Runefangs will become powerful symbols of the Elector Counts.</p>\n<h3>246 IC</h3>\n<p>A High Temple to Sigmar is completed in Reikdorf, and it acts as the centre&nbsp;</p>\n<p>of worship for a cult that now extends throughout the Empire. This rapid expansion leads to open conflict with the cults of Ulric and Taal.</p>\n<h3>990 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Ludwig I, commonly called Ludwig the Fat, grants the Grand Theogonist a vote to select the next emperor. Though some Elector Counts cry foul, and the other cults are astounded at the blatant favouritism, Emperor Ludwig appears far more interested in the lavish banquets prepared for him by the Cult of Sigmar in Reikdorf.</p>\n<h3>1000 IC</h3>\n<p>1000 years after Sigmar was crowned emperor, the Cult of Sigmar completes a new High Temple in Reikdorf. It is the largest temple in all the Empire, and cements Sigmar worship as the primary cult in the Reikland. In celebration, Emperor Ludwig&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I renames his city Altdorf, demonstrating its age and importance to the Empire as a whole.</p>\n<h3>1053-1115 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Rule of Boris Goldgather</em>. Emperor Boris I proves to be exceptionally unpopular and corrupt, with his rule known for exorbitant taxes, weak leadership, and a complete neglect of the military.</p>\n<h3>1106-1110 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Rise of the Drakwald</em>: Beastmen and other vile creatures swarm from beneath the twisted bowers of the Drakwald, sacking villages, towns, and fortifications across the Drakwald province. When the last heir to the Drakwald throne is slain in battle with an enormous Bestigor, Emperor Boris I chooses to place the Drakwald Runefang in his Altdorf palace. Publicly, when a suitable heir is found, the Runefang will be passed on. Privately, Boris has no intention of ever giving up the magical blade.</p>\n<h3>1111-1115 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Black Plague</em>. Disease sweeps through the Reikland, killing nine in every ten people, and debilitating half of those left alive. Skaven then erupt from their under-Empire and attack. When Emperor Boris I dies of the plague in 1115 IC, no-one replaces him in the ensuing anarchy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1115-1124 IC</p>\n<p><em>The Rat Wars</em>. Skaven move to systematically enslave the remaining population of the Empire, and effectively wipe-out what remains of the Drakwald province. In response, Elector Count Mandred of Middenland rallies a desperate defence, and with the help of Elven allies from the laurelorn Forest, finally drives the Skaven back below ground. At the end of the war, the victorious Mandred is elected emperor by the three surviving elector bloodlines.</p>\n<h3>1152-1359 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Age of Wars</em>. Emperor Mandred II is assassinated by the Skaven in 1152 IC. The Elector Counts cannot agree on a successor as they are too concerned about rivals invading their devastated grand provinces, so a fraught interregnum ensues for over two centuries. During this time, the Princes of the Reikland rule their Grand Province unfettered as civil war rages across the Empire.</p>\n<h3>1359-1547 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Time of Two Emperors</em>. In a desperate bid to end the bloodshed, the Electors meet in Altdorf and eventually agree on&nbsp;a choice for emperor, crowning Elector Count Wilhelm of Stirland as emperor by a majority of one. Elector Countess Ottila of Talabecland is outraged at this, and claims the vote is rigged. When she returns to Talabheim she declares herself Empress without a vote, and is supported in her claim by the Cults of Taal and Ulric. She then outlaws the Cult of Sigmar in Talabecland, a decree that stands for almost a thousand years. The civil wars escalate.</p>\n<h3>1421 IC</h3>\n<p>Shipbuilding rises to prominence in Altdorf&rsquo;s natural harbour, the Reiksport. Soon, quality vessels built in the Reikland are plying the Reik river system.</p>\n<h3>1489 IC</h3>\n<p>The prince of the Reikland formally commissions a navy, worried about the influence of ships sailing from Talabheim, Carroburg, Nuln, and Marienburg. To help limit their influence, Altdorf builds several low bridges across the Reik and Talabec to block larger ships and to control trade.</p>\n<h3>1547-1979 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Time of Three Emperors</em>. After Sigmarites botch an assassination attempt when Electors refuse to back their choice for the next emperor, the Elector Count of Middenland denounces the imperial elections as a corrupt sham, and declares himself the rightful emperor. He has the support of the cult of Ulric, which had recently fallen out with the Talabecland emperors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Empire now has three Emperors: The Electoral Emperor supported by the cult of Sigmar, the Ottilian Emperor supported by the Cult of Taal, and the Wolf Emperor supported by the Cult of Ulric. The civil wars intensify.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>c. 1450-1550 IC</h3>\n<p>Knights returning rich from the crusades against Araby found new knightly orders and chapterhouses across the Reikland. They also fund the first temple of Myrmidia in Altdorf, a simple building sponsored by the newly invested Knights of the Blazing Sun.</p>\n<h3>1681 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Night of the Restless Dead</em>. The dead stir in the Gardens of Morr. Corpses rise, bones rattle, and the dead walk the land, sowing terror and confusion. Entire towns and villages are overrun before dawn brings a reprieve from the rapacious hunger of the deceased.</p>\n<h3>1707-1712 IC</h3>\n<p><em>WAAAGH! Gorbad!</em> and the First Siege of Altdorf. Taking advantage of the divided Empire, the Orc Warboss Gorbad Ironclaw invades with a tide of Greenskins at his back, destroying the Grand Province of Solland, sacking Nuln and much of Wissenland, and eventually sweeping through the Reikland razing almost a third of its settlements before his green wave eventually breaks against the walls of Altdorf; but not before the Prince of Altdorf, and Electoral Emperor, Sigismund IV is killed.</p>\n<h3>1940 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Poisoned Feast</em>. The Great Enchanter, Constant Drachenfels, in one of his most famous treacheries, invites the Electoral Emperor, Carolus II, and the entire imperial court and its families, to a&nbsp;great feast held in his castle. Drachenfels poisons his guests, paralysing them. He then starves them to death in front of the marvellous banquet he prepared. This wipes out several important noble bloodlines of the Reikland, deeply destabilising the grand province and the Electoral Emperors as a whole.</p>\n<h3>1979-2303 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Dark Ages</em>. Elector Countess Magritta of Westerland is elected empress, but the Cult of Sigmar refuses to crown her, or indeed any other Elector Count or Countess, leaving the Electoral Emperors without a voted emperor. The entire electoral system collapses, and soon most provinces fight only for themselves. Petty warlords claim titles on a whim as new kingdoms, counties, duchies, princedoms and more rise and fall as terror spreads across the former Empire.</p>\n<h3>2010-2146 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Vampire Wars.</em> The Empire has collapsed into thousands of competing factions, and the Vampire Lords of Sylvania rise to exploit the turmoil. In total, three major wars result as three different vampire counts attempt to eradicate the fractured Empire. Each time, the Vampires are driven back through a mixture of unlikely alliances, desperate gambits, and clever strategy.</p>\n<h3>2051 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Second Siege of Altdorf</em>. The vampire lord Vlad von Carstein is slain. His wife, Isabella von Carstein, commits suicide, unable to continue unlife without him. Their armies soon splinter into feuding factions, ending the First Vampire Wars.</p>\n<h3>2100 IC</h3>\n<p>After the inconclusive Battle of Four Armies ended in multiple assassination attempts by supposed allies on the Empire side, it is decided that it is time to elect an emperor to pull everyone together. Elector Count Helmut is the most popular candidate for this, until its discovered he is actually a zombie in&nbsp;the thrall of Konrad von Carstein, the very vampire lord they are trying to defeat. All plans to elect an emperor are abandoned.</p>\n<h3>2135 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Third Siege of Altdorf</em>. The vampire lord Mannfred von Carstein launches a surprise winter attack on the Reikland capital as it recuperated from a summer of civil conflicts but is eventually driven back when the Grand Theogonist of Sigmar uses a forbidden spell to unbind the vampire&rsquo;s necromancy.</p>\n<h3>2203 IC</h3>\n<p>A rift into the Realms of Chaos opens&nbsp;at Castle Drachenfels, resulting in the annihilation of almost every living soul from B&ouml;genhafen to Ubersreik. After more than a week of terror, the rift mysteriously closes.</p>\n<h3>2302-2304 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Great War Against Chaos. </em>Asavar&nbsp;Kul, Everchosen of Chaos, leads a horde&nbsp;of unimaginable size into Kislev, laying waste to everything in his path. In response, Magnus von Bildhofen, a young Nulner noble claiming to be inspired by Sigmar, rallies the fractured and broken Empire into a mighty army to relieve Kislev. He eventually defeats Asavar Kul at the Gates of Kislev alongside Kislevite, Dwarf, and Elven allies.</p>\n<h3>2304-2369 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Reign of Magnus the Pious</em>. Magnus von Bildhofen is elected Emperor Magnus I, the first elected emperor representing&nbsp;all Sigmar&rsquo;s Grand Provinces for almost&nbsp;a thousand years. Riding the wave of popularity he secured by winning the Great War Against Chaos, he immediately initiates sweeping reforms to end the corruption that previously brought the Empire to&nbsp;its knees, creating new laws to limit the nobility, cults, guilds and much more. He also oversees the foundation of many new institutions, including the formal creation of the Empire State Armies, Imperial Navy, and, controversially, the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, making magic legal across all the Empire for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2308-2310 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Third Parravon War</em>. The Bretonnian duchy of Parravon invades the Reikland across the Grey Lady Pass, claiming the military escalation in Ubersreik caused by the mustering of the new State Army breaks&nbsp;an ancient treaty. They are quickly driven back, and the following year Parravon is besieged. Eventually, after a year of occasional skirmishes outside Parravon&rsquo;s extraordinarily high walls, and a great deal of standing around shouting insults, the King of Bretonnia treats on behalf of Parravon with Emperor Magnus I, ending the war.</p>\n<h3>2402-2405 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Fourth Parravon War</em>. The Bretonnian duchy of Parravon again invades the Reikland across the Grey Lady Pass. Ubersreik is besieged twice during the war, but doesn&rsquo;t fall. Peace is eventually brokered by the intervention of Emperor Dieter IV who agrees to pay the Parravonese an extortionate sum of money to retreat, drawing much criticism at court.</p>\n<h3>2415 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Night of a Thousand Arcane Duels</em>. War erupts between the Eight Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, razing large sections of the city and resulting in the death of six of the eight Patriarchs. The Cult of Sigmar pressures the Prince of Altdorf and Emperor Dieter IV to lock the Colleges down, which they do, resulting in the execution of many wizards, and effectively bringing legal magic use to an end in the Empire. Many of the surviving wizards flee the Colleges, never to return.</p>\n<h3>2420-2424 IC</h3>\n<p><em>WAAAGH! Grom!</em> The Goblin Warboss Grom the Paunch leads an enormous horde of Greenskins across the Empire, sacking many Reikland towns and villages, before eventually heading westwards, undefeated, where he then takes to the sea. The lack of wizards from the suspended Colleges of Magic is widely blamed for the repeated military defeats suffered by Reikland&rsquo;s armies.</p>\n<h3>2429 IC</h3>\n<p>Westerland buys its independence from the Empire by bribing Emperor Dieter IV, reforming itself as The Wasteland with Marienburg as its capital. Using anti-corruption laws put in place by Magnus the Pious almost a hundred years earlier, the Elector Counts depose Dieter in the ensuing scandal. He is replaced by Grand Prince Wilhelm of House Holswig-Schliestein&nbsp;of the Reikland, who is named Emperor Wilhelm III, starting the imperial dynasty that rules the Empire to this day.</p>\n<p><em>The Battle for Grootscher Marsh</em>. Emperor Wilhelm III, under pressure from the Elector Counts to respond to the Wasteland&rsquo;s secession from the Empire, gathers the State Armies to invade Marienburg. In late Autumn, the opposing forces meet at the Grootscher Marsh just outside Siert, and the Empire is routed by the advanced Marienburg navy, well-trained mercenaries and militias, and the magics of the Wasteland&rsquo;s High Elven allies. Begrudgingly, Wilhelm verbally recognises the Wasteland&rsquo;s independence, but refuses to ratify it with a treaty. Marienburg accepts this and draws their new border at Siert.</p>\n<h3>2430 IC</h3>\n<p>Appalled at the State Army&rsquo;s inability to effectively counteract the Elven mages and Marienburg ships, Emperor Wilhelm III reinstates the Colleges of Magic after their 15-year suspension and invests significant resources into shipbuilding at the Reiksport.</p>\n<h3>2431 IC</h3>\n<p><em>The Great Fire of Altdorf</em>. The newly reinstated Bright College accidentally sets Altdorf alight when a spell misfires, burning many buildings to the ground. Many lobby Emperor Wilhelm III hard to suspend the colleges again, but eventually he decides to keep them open, but with greater oversight from the Cult of Sigmar.</p>\n<h3>2453 IC</h3>\n<p><em>Fourth Siege of Altdorf</em>. The Liche King, Arkhan the Black, invades the Reikland with a seemingly endless swarm of walking corpses that march straight for Altdorf. Once the siege begins, Arkhan slips unnoticed into the High Temple of Sigmar and steals the dreaded Liber Mortis kept within. Minutes after he escapes, his army collapses, leaving thousands of carcasses mouldering outside the city walls as state soldiers look on in confusion and relief.</p>\n<h3>2480 IC</h3>\n<p>In Drachenfels Castle, Constant Drachenfels is slain by Crown Prince Oswald von K&ouml;nigswald of Ostland.</p>\n<h3>2483 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Luitpold III signs treaties with the Wasteland to allow warships of the Imperial Navy to pass through the city-port of Marienburg. For the first time since the secession of the Wasteland, the Reiklander navy is sailing the high seas, although the tolls to do so are extortionate.</p>\n<h3>2502 IC</h3>\n<p>Emperor Luitpold III dies in his sleep. In a close vote, Luitpold&rsquo;s son is elected to replace him, and is crowned Emperor Karl-Franz I in the High Temple of Sigmar in Altdorf.</p>\n<h3>2505 IC</h3>\n<p>By imperial appointment, the playwright Detlef Seirk attempts to stage an ambitious play in Castle Drachenfels for Emperor Karl-Franz and the gathered nobility of the Empire. It goes disastrously wrong.</p>\n<h3>2508 IC</h3>\n<p>Malathrax the Mighty, an enormous Doomfire Dragon, terrorises the Vorbergland, razing villages and taking livestock, before its driven north across the H&auml;gercrybs. After several months of pursuit, and the eradication of the entire Knightly Order of the Ebon Sword, the Dragon is slain by the Imperial Huntsmarshal, Markus Wulfhart, who places three arrows in its heart.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

He is the brother of Taal and, according to Ulrican lore, the king of the gods, although other cults dispute this. He is normally portrayed as a massive, heavily bearded barbarian wearing a white wolf-pelt cloak, and bearing a mighty war-axe named Blitzbeil. He’s a distant, harsh, and unforgiving god who expects his cultists to rely on individual strength and prowess. He despises weakness, cowardice, and trickery, and favours the direct approach in all matters.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Ulric’s cult is strongest in the north of the Empire. The city-state of Middenheim, with its enormous high temple to Ulric, is the heart of his cult, and the god is regarded as the city’s patron. Elsewhere, he is worshipped mainly by warriors and soldiers. Devout Ulricans can usually be spotted by their long hair and beards, for most choose not to cut it, imitating their wild deity. Ulric’s cult is split into just two orders: the priestly Howling Wolves, and the templar White Wolves. The Howling Wolves are not very popular outside Middenland and Nordland, viewed by most folk to be too coarse for this enlightened era. By comparison, the Knights of the White Wolf are enormously popular, easily the largest knightly order in the Empire, and the oldest templar order in the Old World. Ulric’s priests wear black robes with a howling white wolf emblem on the chest. A wolf pelt across the shoulders is also common, as is fur trimmings.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Ulric’s high temple is in Middenheim, and the cult’s leader, Ar-Ulric (which means the son of Ulric), has enormous temporal and spiritual sway. At the back of the high temple lies the Flame of Ulric, a huge, ever-burning, argent fire granted by the winter god to guide his people. This miracle is the focus of several pilgrimage routes, and all Ulricans of Middenland are expected to bathe in its cold light at least once in their lives. Smaller temples are found in every city and town of any size, but are grander and more numerous in the north than in the south. Chapels and shrines can be found in barracks and forts throughout the Old World.</p>\n<p>Temples resemble fortified keeps and are normally square. The interior of the main hall is lit by small windows high in the walls, and by an ever-stocked fire in a circular hearth tended by the priesthood. Behind the fire, usually against a rear wall, stands a statue of Ulric enthroned, often flanked by a pair of enormous wolves. Shrines are similar but smaller, with a lamp in place of a fire and small statues just a foot or two tall.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Penances set by Ulric are almost always tests of strength, courage, and martial skill. Slaying a powerful monster, or clearing out a nest of Beastmen or outlaws, are typical tasks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Strictures</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Obey your betters.</em></li>\n<li><em>Defend your honour in all matters, and never refuse a challenge.</em></li>\n<li><em>Stand honest and true; outside an ambush, trickery and deception are forbidden.</em></li>\n<li><em>Only wear pelts from wolves killed by weapons crafted of your own hands.</em></li>\n<li><em>Blackpowder, helmets, crossbows, and technology are not Ulric’s way.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.ElmLfnrXliStS9CP]{Blessing of Battle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Cg2Q3TV66cpmheHS]{Blessing of Courage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.0r3moMIHXsBrcOyh]{Blessing of Hardiness}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.KSDrXcieyRc37YI7]{Blessing of Might}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.eBRjKAF6U0yR0KK8]{Blessing of Savagery}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GvaOlWY8iD5CO1WB]{Blessing of Tenacity}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.v28a5ilgxvDJfBqR]{Hoarfrost's Chill}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.9ALNZLZUZSLrLvkd]{Howl of the Wolf}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.3ONBOTaeWq657MQR]{Pelt of the Winter Wolf}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.GVMPSJwgscMVJzpX]{The Snow King's Judgement}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.F6iJdTrvBvGQ54G3]{Ulric's Fury}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.rrfrmqCpy10u7c9o]{Winter's Bite}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/ulric.webp"}

If you outnumber an enemy by 3 to 1, you get an even larger bonus of +40 to hit. Further, at the end of every Round, all outnumbered opponents lose 1 Advantage. Outnumbering is generally determined by how many Characters are Engaged with each other; if there is any doubt, the GM decides who is outnumbering whom.</p>\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<p>Size is an important factor when shooting at a target: it is far easier to hit a barn door than an apple. See @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q]{Size}. If this modifier allows you to hit when the Test would otherwise have failed, you succeed with +0 SL.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Combining Difficulties</em></h3>\n<p><em>There will be instances where multiple factors make taking a particular action more difficult than normal. Lurking in a gloomy forest as you attempt to shoot at a distant opponent through the trees is harder than shooting at the same opponent on a bright day in an open field. When combining multiple difficulties, use the following guidelines:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If the situation would apply two or more penalties, simply add the modifiers together to a maximum of &ndash;30 or Very Hard. For example, fog and aiming for a specific body part both make Weapon Skill Tests <strong>Hard (&ndash;20)</strong>. When combined, the Test would simply be <strong>Very Hard (&ndash;30),</strong> rather than suffer a &ndash;40 modifier. Similarly, if the situation would apply two or more bonuses, add the modifiers together to a maximum of +60 or Very Easy.</em><br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>If the situation would apply a penalty and a bonus, add them together to find the new difficulty. Attacking an opponent while standing in deep snow normally requires a <strong>Very Hard (&ndash;30)</strong> Test. But attacking an opponent who is Prone requires an <strong>Easy (+20)</strong> Test. In a situation where both apply, the Test would be <strong>Difficult (&ndash;10) </strong>since &ndash;30 plus +20 equals &ndash;10.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Options: Shooting Into Melee</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">For most, simply choosing a target and rolling to hit is enough of a complication. However, some prefer the rules be more precise when firing at an Engaged target. If this is you, use the following rules:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Ballistic Skill Tests against Engaged opponents are resolved as normal, but suffer a penalty of &ndash;20 as you try your best to hit your specified target. If this modifier causes you to fail when the Test would otherwise have succeeded, you instead hit one of the target&rsquo;s Engaged opponents, as determined randomly by the gM. If you do not care whom you hit, you may gain a bonus of +20 to +60 to hit, see Shooting into a Group.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"uj8Io2ibvYsMo7XH"}

While all major routes are patrolled by road warden, their numbers are too few and the roads too long, so it&rsquo;s not uncommon to encounter upturned coaches and other signs of banditry. Te majority of the open clearings and abandoned ruins from past wars are claimed as camps by outlaws or by one of the herds of Beastmen roaming the deeper wood, and forays to clear these isolated places by regiments of the Reikland State Army are not uncommon. In most parts the Reikwald&rsquo;s canopy is not so overgrown as to block sunlight, but its depths are frequently gloomy and heavy fogs are common, especially along the marshier stretches of the @JournalEntry[The Reik]{river Reik}. Scholars claim before the Empire was founded the Unberogen tribe of Humans ranged across this misty forest alongside older tribes whose names are now lost to memory. Concentric rings of carved standing stones called &lsquo;oghams&rsquo; still exist from this era, though many are overgrown and almost impossible to find without a guide. Isolated communities still following ancient ways &mdash; old beliefs said to predate the coming of Sigmar &mdash; are said to hold such sites sacred. Intellectuals from the Colleges of Magic postulate terrible battles were once fought for these ancient, megalithic sites, and it&rsquo;s not uncommon to find richer magisters funding explorations into the Reikwald&rsquo;s depths to learn more about the magical stones.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

It forms part of a street of buildings, so characters outside the tavern would need to run for about five minutes to get from one entrance to the other.</p>\n<p>The tavern&rsquo;s a bit taller than some of the surrounding buildings, so characters on the upper floor can attempt an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test to jump to a neighbouring roof. Failing the test would result in a character falling about 3 yards, which would result in 1d10+9 damage (modified for TB but not Armour). My inclination&rsquo;s to soften that a little to be a bit more cinematic if the scene ends in a rooftop chase&hellip;. perhaps allowing characters to make a <strong>Hard (-10) Athletics</strong> Test to halve the damage, as they land in a passing dung cart or pile of refuse.</p>\n<p>The PCs will need to decide how they approach the tavern. If they all burst in through the front door then they&rsquo;re leaving the robbers with an easy escape route through the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Blocking off both entrances is probably their best bet, although this will mean splitting the party. Gaining entrance to a neighbouring building, and sending someone in to jump across to the upper floor is also possible, but risky: this probably requires a<strong> Challenging (+0) Charm or Intimidate</strong> Test to deal with an indignant homeowner, and then an <strong>Average (+20) Climb</strong> Test (assuming they have a rope), to get up on the roof before they can attempt to jump across to the tavern.</p>\n<p>If the PCs do split the party then my inclination would be to take each group out of the room and deal with them separately, keeping track of how many rounds have elapsed. This might result in one group of PCs bursting into the tavern ahead of others.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As the PCs at the front door are preparing to enter, they will spot a man in an old army coat coming out of the latrines outside. He&rsquo;ll see the PCs, mouth <em>&ldquo;oh shit&rdquo;</em>, and turn to run. As it turns out, he doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the robbery (although the PCs won&rsquo;t necessarily know that&hellip;) he&rsquo;s just an unrelated petty criminal with sufficient reason to be afraid of the Watch.</li>\n<li>PCs attempting to enter through the rear of the tavern will discover that the kitchen door is barred from the inside. Breaking it down is an <strong>Extended Strength</strong> Test, requiring a total of 3 successes. Alternatively, a <strong>Charm or Intimidate</strong> Test could be used to persuade the kitchen staff to unlock it. One or more of the kitchen staff may also seek to warn the robbers if they feel they can get away with it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unless they&rsquo;ve been alerted, the robbers are seated around a table playing cards when the PCs enter. If any of the PCs pass an<strong> Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test, they&rsquo;ll spot a duffel bag at the robbers&rsquo; feet: this contains the stolen documents. One of the robbers will be returning to the table with a round of beers.</p>\n<p>In the first round, the robbers will spring for their weapons and kick the table over to provide cover (<strong>-20 to hit if anyone targets them with missile weapons</strong>). Other patrons will scatter everywhere once the fight starts, which could potentially impede either side. Characters firing missile weapons in the tavern will risk hitting an innocent bystander if they fail by -3 SLs or more. One of the robbers will grab the duffle bag and attempt to flee with it, either towards the kitchens if none of the PCs have come through that way (although he&rsquo;ll still need to unbar the door if he reaches it), or up to the second floor where he&rsquo;ll attempt to jump to a neighbouring building.</p>\n<p>The robbers are unlikely to surrender, as they know that they will be hanged for their crimes if captured. They will instead seek to fight off the PCs, or buy enough time to escape with the papers. If the opportunity presents itself, Helmut will grandstand a little, accusing the PCs of being agents of injustice whose laws only serve to protect the idle rich while poor men starve. He&rsquo;s also likely to claim that a few of them will be dining with him in hell that evening.</p>\n<p>The PCs might decide to stake out the tavern instead, potentially in an attempt to catch whoever means the purchase the documents in the act. This isn&rsquo;t at all unreasonable, but will be extremely difficult. Make it clear to them that this is an area where a group of watchmen (or other strangers) are likely to draw attention, and remind them that the robbers are local heroes. If the PCs insist on going this route then <strong>Stealth (Urban)</strong> Tests are probably required (adjusted for difficulty depending on what they are attempting). If the PCs all pass then the robbers will exit together after a couple of hours, to meet their contact and sell the papers on for blackmail. The PCs can then either spring whatever form of ambush they&rsquo;ve contrived (which probably means that the robbers need to pass <strong>Perception</strong> Tests or start the encounter <strong>Surprised</strong>) or attempt to tail them. If any of the PCs fail their <strong>Stealth (Urban)</strong> Tests then they have been spotted, which is likely to result in one or more of the tavern&rsquo;s patrons or staff spotting them and tipping off the robbers about their presence. The robbers will then attempt to sneak out as discretely as possible, unless they believe that they have been surrounded in which case they attempt to break through whichever side of the cordon appears weakest (although their information may well be incomplete, if some of the PCs have managed to remain hidden).</p>"}

Most of them have obviously recently awoken, being clad in coats hastily thrown over their night shirts. The night watchman in question (&ldquo;Old Gunter&rdquo;) is a chap of advanced years, who&rsquo;s paid by the district to patrol with a lantern and sound the alarm in the event of intruders. He&rsquo;s been shot, and is lying in a pool of his own blood. A smashed lantern lies close by.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of gawking and talk about how deplorable this all is from the gathered spectators, but no one&rsquo;s actually helping. If the PCs want to, they can attempt a <strong>Challenging (+0) Heal</strong> Test to staunch the wound or a <strong>Fellowship Test</strong> to send someone off to summon a physician (this will probably be an <strong>Average (+20) Leadership</strong> Test, with a -10 penalty if the NPC has a higher social status). The night watchman will bleed out and die otherwise.</p>\n<h3>Questioning the night watchman:</h3>\n<p>If the PCs question the night watchman, he can tell them that he was doing the rounds with his lantern (<em>&ldquo;Eleven o&rsquo; Clock and All&rsquo;s Well&hellip;&rdquo;</em>) when he heard sounds of a disturbance from the Ottinger residence, and startled by the sight of a band of masked men. He called out to challenge them (<em>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</em>), and one of them responded by shooting him with a pistol. If the night watchman hasn&rsquo;t been healed, then his replies will become considerably less coherent after the first few questions (<em>&ldquo;so cold&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;tell my wife I love her&hellip;&rdquo;</em> etc), until he eventually passes out.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Charm</strong> or <strong>Gossip</strong> Test (which will be <strong>Average (+20)</strong> if he&rsquo;s been healed, and anywhere between <strong>Challenging (+0)</strong> and <strong>Hard (-20)</strong> if not, depending on how much blood he&rsquo;s lost) might jog his memory to the extent that he&rsquo;ll recall that there were about half a dozen robbers, some of whom appeared to be wearing army coats. A couple of them were carrying duffel bags, but them seemed otherwise unencumbered with stolen goods. If the PCs roll +2 SL or higher, he might also remember that one of the robbers had some sort of distinguishing mark &ndash; perhaps he caught sight of the mark from a branding that wasn&rsquo;t fully concealed by the masks they wore., or he saw that one of them ran with a slight limp, favouring one leg over the other.</p>\n<h3>Questioning the crowd:</h3>\n<p>The PCs might well interview members of the crowd, which is made up of wealthy Altdorfers and their servants. They&rsquo;re angry and frightened, and will generally expect immediate deference from their social inferiors (which is likely to include the PCs). None of them know anything important, but they&rsquo;ll be very happy to offer their opinions on the matter.</p>\n<p>Representative sentiments will include: <em>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a disgrace, whatever&rsquo;s Altdorf coming to?&rdquo;, &ldquo;whoever did this ought to be strung up!&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;You there &ndash; yes you, with the beard! Do you really think this is good enough? We all pay our taxes, and this poor fellow&rsquo;s shot on our very doorstep. I demand to know what the Watch is going to do about it!&rdquo;</em></p>"}

The Crooked Corridor is a narrow gorge through the mountains not far from the border with the Wasteland. It is useless to most merchants, being far too tight for wagons or horses, and dangerous to boot as much of the path is perched precariously on the edge of steep cliﬀs, meaning the slightest slip of a foot could lead to a painfully inglorious end.</p>\n<p>Completely impassable in the winter and perilous at all other times, the Crooked Corridor was known only to goat herders and smugglers until a spate of Greenskin raids brought the pass to the attention of the authorities.</p>\n<p>Several decades ago, Emperor Mattheus II ordered the construction of a fortress to watch over the Crooked Corridor after repeated invasion. Nine years later, Blackstone Tower was completed, drawing its name from the locally quarried dark stone that forms its walls, and the slate that tops its towers.</p>\n<p>Its position high above the Crooked Corridor oﬀered the Emperor&rsquo;s sharpshooters an excellent perch from which to employ their lethal skills; however, its status as a Reiklander bastion was short-lived. An oversight at the planning stage resulted in the tower being built on lands claimed by the Dwarfs of Karak Ziﬂin. Not wanting to upset the Dwarfs, the Emperor ceded the tower, much to the annoyance of the Margrave of Geetburg who had helped finance it.</p>\n<p>Today, the Dwarfs &lsquo;generously&rsquo; allow a limited garrison to barrack alongside their own troops at Blackstone Tower, a largely rebuilt structure. With the Reiklanders chafing under the Dwarfs&rsquo; leadership, and the Dwarfs constantly belittling the shoddy human stonework they&rsquo;ve yet to replace, the Tower is a powderkeg of grievances and resentment, generating a tense &mdash;and some would say unsustainable &mdash; atmosphere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

When diplomacy fails, is not attempted, or is not understood as a basic concept, Combat begins!</p>\n<p>In Combat, lots of individuals take actions in a short space of time, many of them in direct opposition to each other. You will still be taking Tests to resolve these actions, but timing and a host of other factors become more important, so we have some rules to make everything work.</p>\n<h3>Timing</h3>\n<p>In Combat, the exact timing of actions matters more, so time is organised into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rounds</strong>: A Round is enough time for all characters to attempt a Test and move into position. It’s normally a just few seconds, the GM can decide exactly how long if necessary.</li>\n<li><strong>Turns</strong>: During a Round, each combatant has a Turn to perform an Action and a Move.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiative Order</strong>: Each combatant usually takes their Turn in order of their Initiative Characteristic, from highest to lowest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Combat Summary</h3>\n<p>Combat follows these steps until one side flees or is defeated:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Determine Surprise</strong>: The GM determines if any characters are Surprised . This normally only happens on the first round of combat. See the section below.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Round Begins</strong>: If the rules call for something to happen at the start of the Round , it happens now.</li>\n<li><strong>Characters Take Turns</strong>: Each combatant takes a Turn in Initiative order, starting with the highest Initiative. Each Character can normally perform a Move and an Action on their Turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Round Ends</strong>: The Round ends when all combatants have taken a Turn. If the rules call for something to happen at the end of the Round, it happens now.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeat Steps 2–5 As Required</strong>: Continue to play through Rounds until the combat is resolved.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Initiative Order</h3>\n<p>Combatants act in Initiative order during the Round, with the highest Initiative acting first, until all involved have taken a Turn. If you want this to work quickly at the table, have the players sit in Initiative order. If multiple combatants have the same Initiative, they act in order from the highest Agility to the lowest. If they also have the same Agility, then roll an Opposed Agility Test, with the winner choosing who goes first for the combat. Some Talents impact combat order (see Chapter 4: Skills and Talents). Example: Tollich, with an Initiative of 38, always acts ahead of his companion, Perdita who has an Initiative of 33. If they attack a coven of cultists, each with Initiative 35, the combat order would be: Tollich (38), the Cultists (35), Perdita (33).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Roll For Initiative!</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some groups prefer to randomise Initiative. There are several ways to do this, choose your favourite:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Each character rolls an Initiative Test to determine a SL.</em></li>\n<li><em>Each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their Initiative.</em></li>\n<li><em>Each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their Agility Bonus + Initiative Bonus.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The GM notes the results in decreasing numerical order and uses this as the Initiative Order. You could use this order for every Round (quickest option) or roll each Round (gives some variety to the order; slow characters have the chance to not always go last).</em><br><strong>Foundry Note:&nbsp;</strong>You can find these initiative options in the system settings menu.<em><br></em></p>\n<h3><em>Rounds Outside Combat</em></h3>\n<p><em>Out of combat, the exact timing of those actions is usually flexible. Sometimes it is helpful to use Rounds outside of Combat to help organise everyone’s contributions; for example, Extended Tests happen over several rounds, with one Test taken each Round.&nbsp;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Surprise</h3>\n<p>Taking your enemy by surprise gives you a big advantage. If one side is planning an attack, they can attempt to harness the element of surprise by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hiding</strong>: Make a successful Stealth Test in appropriate cover. Characters may oppose this with a Perception Test if they are wary, or if the GM is feeling generous.</li>\n<li><strong>Sneaky Tactics</strong>: Attack from behind, in the dark, through heavy fog, or from above! The GM may allow a Perception Test to spot the incoming attackers if appropriate.</li>\n<li><strong>Distractions</strong>: Loud bangs, milling crowds and an especially engaging sermon are just some of the distractions that could harbour a surprise attack!</li>\n<li><strong>Unprepared Defenders</strong>: If the enemy are particularly unwary, the attackers automatically surprise their victims.</li>\n<li><strong>Something Else</strong>: Other sneaky and ingenious plans concocted by cunning players — the GM has the final call on the possibility of surprise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there is a chance the ambushers will be spotted, the GM will typically call for <strong>Opposed Stealth vs Perception</strong> Test, usually with the character with the worst Stealth opposing all potential spotters. If the ambusher wins, each defeated character gains the @Condition[Surprised] Condition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If no-one is surprised, proceed with the combat as normal.</p>\n<p>If anyone is surprised, they can use a Resolve point to remove the @Condition[Surprised] Condition.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Taking Your Turn]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Attacking]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Criticals and Fumbles]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Combat Difficulty]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Ranged Combat]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Two-Weapon Fighting]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Unarmed Combat]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Mounted Combat]</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Advantage]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","_id":"vqt8fmk6KuQAxz87"}

Of note, look to Broken, which was never supposed to imply the&nbsp;<em>Bestial</em>&nbsp;trait was ignored completely.<br /><br /><strong>Broken:</strong> The animal has been domesticated. Now tame, it gains +2d10&nbsp;<strong>Fel</strong>, even if it has the&nbsp;<em>Bestial</em>&nbsp;trait. Further, it can now learn more&nbsp;<em>Trained</em>&nbsp;traits (see&nbsp;<strong>WFRP</strong>&nbsp;page 199).</p>\n<p><strong>Calm:</strong> The animal gains a bonus of +10 to Tests to ignore panic caused by the <em>Skittish</em> trait for each point it has in Calm. It can have a maximum of <strong>WPB</strong> rating in this trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Drive:</strong> The animal is trained to pull a coach, cart, plough, buggy, or similar. The animal can pull up to its own body weight for <strong>TB</strong> hours without needing to make an Endurance Test. The animal can also pull up to twice its body weight for short hauls of <strong>TB</strong> minutes. The animal's gains a bonus of +1 <strong>TB</strong> to do this for each point it has in Drive. It can have a maximum of <strong>WPB</strong> rating in this trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Fetch:</strong>&nbsp;The animal is trained to spot and retrieve an object or prey undamaged.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack</strong>: The animal is trained to carry great weights on its back. It can carry its Strength rating in Encumbrance points upon its back for each point it has in Pack. This limit is doubled for each step in the Size trait to the creature has above Large. It can have a maximum of <strong>TB</strong> rating in this trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Pointer:</strong>&nbsp;The animal is trained to spot birds and 'point' to them by freezing and aiming their muzzle towards the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical:</strong> The animal is trained to accept a spellcaster as a rider. Without this Trained trait, the animal typically shies from spellcasters.</p>\n<p><strong>War:</strong>&nbsp;The animal is trained to carry a rider into the hell of war. It can use its Rider&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>WP</strong>&nbsp;instead of its own&nbsp;for all appropriate Tests</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NEW TRAITS</h2>\n<h3>Amble</h3>\n<p>The creature has a smooth gait, making it more comfortable to ride over long distances. Add +Amble hours to any length of time a rider can comfortably ride. Further, reduce the Combat Difficulty for<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><em>Shooting From Horseback</em><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>by 1 step.*</p>\n<p>*: Amble references rules I use where you can't ride a horse for longer than&nbsp;<strong>TB</strong>&nbsp;hours a day without picking up some&nbsp;<em>Fatigue</em>&nbsp;Conditions, depending upon the results of an&nbsp;<strong>Endurance</strong>&nbsp;Test. Further, Shooting From Horseback is a penalty of at least &ndash;20, depending upon the circumstances. Riders with the&nbsp;<em>Trick Riding&nbsp;</em>Talent reduce this difficulty by 1 step.</p>\n<h3>Fine</h3>\n<p>This repurposes the Item <em>Fine</em> Quality for animals. For animals the <em>Fine </em>Trait represents a pedigree. Mongrels cannot purchase the <em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to represent breeding, but it could be purchased to show a dog with a particularly pretty face or similar.</p>\n<p>If a Player wants to buy any special breed beyond the generic versions, at least 1 instance of&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;should be bought to show it's a purebred animal accessing the special rules.</p>\n<p>For each&nbsp;<em>Fine</em> Trait the animal has, its price is doubled and its @JournalEntry[Going To Market]{Availability} is one step less.</p>\n<p>A typical Telland actually starts at 7GC (the base cost of 3GC 10/&ndash; is doubled because of the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality).</p>\n<p>The more&nbsp;<em>Fine</em> Traits purchased, the stronger the bloodline of the animal, and the more impressive it appears. This brings no advantages beyond bragging rights and high returns if the animal is ever sold.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Insisting special breeds have the Fine quality is not a firm rule, as you may wish to keep costs low at some points; it's more of a guideline that you should most always follow.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0px; outline: none; padding: 0px;\">Sure-Feet</h3>\n<p>The creature can instinctually find its footing, even when it has a rider on its back. The creature automatically passes all Tests concerning uncertain footing caused by such things as screes, rocky trails, heavy undergrowth, and similar.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;None of the creatures in the&nbsp;<strong>WFRP</strong> rulebook should have either of these two traits, but they could be used as an Optional wherever you feel it fits.</p>\n<h3>Swimmer</h3>\n<p>Start with <em>Swim</em> Skill +10</p>\n<h3>Ugly</h3>\n<p>This repurposes the Item <em>Ugly</em> Flaw for animals. Taking the <em>Ugly</em> Trait for your pet shows it's particularly ill-favoured in appearance, which may come with penalties in some situations.</p>\n<p>Ugly animals attract negative attention, and related Fellowship Tests might even suffer a &ndash;10 penalty.</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em> Trait the animal has,&nbsp;halves the listed price and improves @JournalEntry[Going To Market]{Availability} by one step.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note: Exotic items do not have their Availability modified by being Flawed &mdash; they are always difficult to find, even shoddy examples.</p>"}

Their leader claims to be a follower of Valten, who he calls Sigmar reborn, and vows to purge the city of its wickedness. (&ldquo;Do you think Sigmar is blind to your drunkenness, your fornications, and your thievery? Do you think your wicked hearts are cloaked from his righteous gaze?

If the PCs make a point of challenging them then the flagellants won&rsquo;t back down from a fight.</p>\n<p>&bull; An agitator claims that a plague of man size rats have descended on the farmland in Averland, and devoured the grain. (\"Do you want to know why grain prices are going through the roof? Do you want to know why your children are starving?

The Agitator will start a Distance of 4 ahead of the PCs. The PCs might initially need to make Athletics checks to catch him (against the Agitator&rsquo;s Agility of 40), then Strength or Intimidate Checks to force their way through the crowded streets (against the Agitator&rsquo;s Strength of 30), then Athletics checks as he jumps over a cart that&rsquo;s blocking the road.</p>\n<p>&bull; A baker complains that someone&rsquo;s put a stone through his window. It seems they&rsquo;re agitated about rising bread prices, but he explains that grain prices have been going up as well. Word is that there&rsquo;s a dock strike at Carroburg, and the dockers are leaving it to rot until their demands are met.</p>\n<p>&bull; A peddler is selling charms in the shape of an angel, which he claims will bring good luck. A pair of Sigmarite zealots accost him, accusing him of idolatry. If the PCs ask the peddler to explain himself, he will tell them that an angel is reported to have fallen from the skies over the Grey Mountains. The story is that it was pursued by a swarm of winged demons. The angel turned and slew its attackers, but one of its wings was crippled in the fight and it plummeted to the earth.</p>\n<p>&bull; The PCs hear speculation at the pub that a Dwarven entrepreneur has sponsored this year&rsquo;s Reiksd&aelig;g festival. There are mixed feelings about this: some are excited by the rumour that he&rsquo;ll be giving away dwarf beer, others feel that the Reiksd&aelig;g is a human celebration, and resent the rumour that a dwarf&rsquo;s trying to cash in on their culture.</p>\n<p>&bull; A woman&rsquo;s body is found floating in the Reik.

The body&rsquo;s eyes have also been cut out: this form of mutilation isn&rsquo;t uncommon in murders, as tradition has it that a Priest of Morr can look into a corpse&rsquo;s eyes to recall the last thing the dead person saw.</p>\n<p>The locals are generally indifferent, although there&rsquo;s a chance that a hysterical old woman insists that the Beast has returned (and is probably answered with considerable mockery from the others). Some of the locals will acknowledge that they heard her quarrelling with her pimp (&ldquo;Lucky Leos&rdquo;) who believed she was holding money back and threatened to carve her up. Unless the PCs intervene, this will be seen as sufficient evidence, and the pimp will be promptly taken into custody to face charges, loudly protesting his innocence to anyone who&rsquo;s willing to listen.</p>\n<p>&bull; A crippled soldier&rsquo;s begging by the side of the road, singing loudly and off key as he begs for coppers.

This so charmed Shallya that the goddess fell in love. One fateful day, she found Ranald dying, fatally touched by the plagues of the Fly Lord. Unable to accept this, she let Ranald drink from her holy chalice, granting the rogue eternal life. But it was all a trick — Ranald had faked it all — and, laughing, the new god gleefully danced into the heavens. While generally portrayed as a dapper Human wearing a perpetual smile, there is little consistency to the height, weight, skin colour, or even gender of Ranald, though the god is more commonly portrayed as male in the Empire. More a cheerful trickster than outright criminal, Ranald is said to have a love of deflating pride with clever tricks and ruses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Worshippers</strong></h3>\n<p>Ranald most commonly stands as a patron to thieves and rogues, but the cult also attracts gamblers, liars, merchants, tricksters, and the poor and downtrodden.</p>\n<p>The cult of Ranald is, by general perception, a disorganised rabble of charlatans, thieves, and ne’er-do-wells. However, it is more co-ordinated than it appears, and split into three primary orders. The Crosses are the most accepted — a priesthood overseeing the cult’s gambling-dens, typically using the proceeds to administer to the poor. The Brotherhood is less open, and is somewhat akin to a secret society of merchants — they use business to bring the pompous and greedy to their knees. Lastly, and most widespread, is the publicly disavowed Crooked Fingers, the thieves, rogues, and liars of Ranald, a group that is roundly distrusted.</p>\n<p>Cultists of Ranald have no conventional garb to identify them, but always work cross symbols into their clothing somewhere, perhaps as a repeating pattern.</p>\n<h3><strong>Holy Sites</strong></h3>\n<p>Ranald has no formal temple organisation, although the cult maintains seemingly unconnected gambling dens in most towns and cities. Small shrines are found in the headquarters of many criminal gangs and merchant houses, and the poorer quarters of many cities have street-corner shrines dedicated to the God of Luck. The latter are often maintained by local ‘shrine clubs’ which operate as both social and religious bodies, and are usually led by one of the Crooked Fingers. Shrines are almost never elaborate, often just a simple, smiling statue with crossed fingers behind the back, or a crudely depicted cat or magpie, often fashioned as if smiling.</p>\n<h3><strong>Penances</strong></h3>\n<p>Ranald’s penances usually involve stealing into locked and guarded locations to recover precious items or leave a token of their presence. Humiliating oppressors of the poor is also common — perhaps by framing a brutal Watch captain for a ludicrous crime, for example, or locking him in his own cells. Ranald often sends favoured and disfavoured cultists alike on a ‘Pilgrimage of Fingers’, a set of tasks proving capability and loyalty.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Strictures</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>One coin in ten belongs to Ranald.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never betray another to the authorities; there is no greater sin than informing.</em></li>\n<li><em>Violence is prohibited except in self-defence.</em></li>\n<li><em>It is better to live free and die than live under oppression.</em></li>\n<li><em>There is no honour among thieves, but there is amongst Ranaldans.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Blessings</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.FElNQGNiPzaOwwKT]{Blessing of Charisma}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tEMwdlHM8A40h6HE]{Blessing of Conscience}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.OkKWAfnMiHfxhTnB]{Blessing of Finesse}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.iIfYOlNrLb0uiV8c]{Blessing of Fortune}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.K5DE9cceinUTIrem]{Blessing of Protection}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.tMocig1z9dHKNiCT]{Blessing of Wit}</p>\n<h3>Miracles</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.cTZVEgAyT9l4vx3i]{An Invitation }</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Bo3ukcaipFNb7Ljl]{Cat's Eyes}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.hL7B3d7A0sYYjHXn]{Ranald's Grace}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.QSwJNH8sotKjtdi4]{Rich Man, Poor Man, Beggar Man, Thief}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.FfGboPdR54WHtkAE]{Stay Lucky}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.fABd17NZvg2uUReL]{You Ain’t Seen Me, Right?}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/ranald.webp"}

Throughout the day and long into the evening, the street crowds with all manner of people, who dodge between the carts and wagons that arrive to deliver fresh casks of ale.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Black Bat</li>\n<li>The Breastplate of Myrmidia</li>\n<li>The Crescent Moon</li>\n<li>The Holy Hammer of Sigmar</li>\n<li>The Temple of Drama</li>\n<li>The Sullen Knight</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Taverns</h3>\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"table-layout: fixed; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, sans, sans-serif; width: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; border: none;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col width=\"201\" /></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Beard of Ulric&quot;}\">The Beard of Ulric</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Black Bat&quot;}\">The Black Bat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Blue Lantern&quot;}\">The Blue Lantern</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Boatman Inn&quot;}\">The Boatman Inn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Breastplate of Myrmidia&quot;}\">The Breasts of Myrmidia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Bruno&rsquo;s Brauhaus&quot;}\">Bruno&rsquo;s Brauhaus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Crescent Moon&quot;}\">The Crescent Moon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Crown and Two Chairmen&quot;}\">The Crown and Two Chairmen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Dancing Dwarf&quot;}\">The Dancing Dwarf</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Drunken Bastard&quot;}\">The Drunken Bastard</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Ensign Vormundreich&quot;}\">The Ensign Vormundreich</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Gryphon and Star&quot;}\">The Gryphon and Star</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Hammer and Bucket&quot;}\">The Hammer and Bucket</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Holy Hammer of Sigmar&quot;}\">The Holy Hammer of Sigmar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Mattheus II&quot;}\">The Mattheus II</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Mermaid&quot;}\">The Mermaid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The One Eyed Wolf&quot;}\">The One Eyed Wolf</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Seven Stars&quot;}\">The Seven Stars</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Short Measure&quot;}\">The Short Measure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Staff of Verena&quot;}\">The Staff of Verena</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 21px;\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #cccccc; overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Sullen Knight&quot;}\">The Sullen Knight</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 21px;\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #cccccc; overflow: hidden; padding: 2px 3px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Wayfarers Rest&quot;}\">The Wayfarers Rest</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

Those sentenced to a period of incarceration in the keep receive an identification number chalked upon a small cloth. The guards leave them in a small cell with a group of fellow inmates for company until their sentence is complete.</p>"}
