  "description": "<p>The Old World.</p>\n<p>On the surface, it is a vast and fertile place, filled with teeming cities, Elf-haunted forests and lofty crags where Dwarves battle with Goblins and their kin. But a shadow hangs over the world, cast by the dark, corrupting hand of Chaos. From the pirate-ridden coast of Tilea to the fortified villages of the barbaric East, a few heroes strive to hold back the endless tide of Chaos spilling from the North.</p>\n<p>But Chaos also gnaws from within, and its hidden servants work to bring the world to its knees before the Dark Gods. It is the corrupted individuals who walk the corridors of power, and the unsuspecting masses who harbour the seeds of Chaos in their very being, who pose the most dangerous enemy of all -&nbsp;<strong>the enemy within.</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13pt; color: #2b2d29; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;\"><br style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /></span></p>",
