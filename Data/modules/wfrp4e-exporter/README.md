<h1>WFRP4E Statblock Exporter</h1>

The WFRP Statblock Exporter is designed for users who are writing a WFRP4E adventure and want to use Foundry's feature-rich implementation to build and/or test a character's stats and then export them in a format that is similar to the statblocks we see in official adventure releases.

In other words, you can build an actor, fill in his skills, talents, traits, spells, trappings etc. and export them all into a statblock you can insert into a Word document or similar.

This video explains a little bit better... and it has monocles.
