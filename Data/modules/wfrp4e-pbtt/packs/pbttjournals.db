{"_id":"1LL8pYaKevaL3XR3","name":"Brunhilde Klaglich - Wasmeier's Right Hand","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/brunhilde-klaglich.webp\" width=\"274\" height=\"274\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich}</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Brunhilde is smart enough to know that Wasmeier has no loyalty to her. She works for him because it furthers her own goals. She is not a member of the Purple Hand and does not know that her master worships Tzeentch — but if she did, she wouldn't care.</p>\n<p>During the adventure, Klaglich wants to keep the taxes in place to destabilise the powerful people of Middenheim and make way for control by @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}.  Her aim is to ensure the critical NPCs support the taxes and nobody upsets the plan to replace the Graf.</p>\n<p>On a deeper level, she revels in the idea of disruption. She wants to see the current order torn down, because she believes that society must be constantly renewed through turmoil and disorder. She does not want a better world, she just wants to upset the current one.</p>\n<p>Klaglich takes great personal satisfaction in outwitting others. If she can, she deceives and lies to others whenever the opportunity presents itself — it makes her feel superior.</p>\n<h4>Potion of Resistance</h4>\n<p>This potion makes the drinker utterly incoherent, as though drunk, but at the same time immune to pain. These effects last [[/r 2+d10]] hours. During this time, the imbiber suffers three @Condititon[Stunned] Conditions, and cannot make Endurance Tests to remove them until the effects of the potion wear off. During that time, they also gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.IAWyzDfC286a9MPz]{Immunity to Psychology} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.wMwSRDmgiF2IdCJr]{Painless} Traits, making them immune to interrogation and torture.</p>\n<h3>Secret Identities</h3>\n<p><strong>Brunhilde Klaglich</strong>: Undisguised, Brunhilde is a striking woman with blonde hair, unusually bright green eyes, and full lips. She has an open, friendly expression that completely belies her personality. Going about the city, she wears plain burgher’s clothes and a broad hat with a brim that’s easily pulled down to shadow her face. </p>\n<p><strong>Elise Kaltblutig</strong>: When in the role she used to blackmail @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}, Brunhilde wears her hair dyed black, centre-parted and scraped back in coiled braids on the back of her head. She rouges her skin to make it look flushed and pushes cotton wadding into her cheeks to make them fuller. Her simple clothes are typical of an Ulrican pilgrim. When meeting Ar-Ulric, she pulls a grey cowl over her head and speaks in a flat monotone.</p>\n<p><strong>Frau Kenner</strong>: In this guise, Klaglich plays to the Chancellor’s inexperience with women. She wears her blonde hair down and speaks softly but persuasively from under a deep blue hood. Her fingers are covered with silver rings bearing Ranaldite symbols. She affects a coastal Nordlander accent.</p>\n<p><strong>‘Charlotte’</strong>: When she hypnotised @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}, Klaglich looked and acted like the kind of attractive person who floats on the periphery of carousers in Middenheim’s upmarket taverns. She wore a wig with brown curly hair, a great deal of makeup, and a revealing dress, but nothing that attracted too much attention. If she suspects Schmiedehammer’s hypnosis is wearing off, she uses this disguise to revisit him.</p>\n<p><strong>Baroness Marlena Klochmann</strong>: If she needs to talk directly with @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, Klaglich visits him disguised as a Middenland minor noble. She powders her skin to make it very pale, streaks her hair with grey ash, and uses a tight corset to change her shape and stiffen her movements. She wears outdated but expensive robes and speaks in a refined, dry voice — at least until she can be sure that she and the Law Lord are alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Zena Kroll</strong>: If the party make good progress in their investigation, Klaglich may engage them directly as Zena Kroll — who looks exactly like a ‘potential replacement party member’. She approaches them in the @JournalEntry[ieHrUyFz83TkBikg]{Templar’s Arms} and introduces herself as a former road warden looking to join an adventuring party. She asks them about their exploits and then subtly drops a clue to implicate the Gausser family of Nordland in a clandestine plot to influence the Graf and destabilise Middenheim. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Middenheim)</strong> Test reveals that the Gaussers have often voiced disquiet at Todbringer influence in Nordland. ‘Zena’ also hints that Nordlanders are suspect anyway, what with so many of them having Norscan blood. This is an attempt to put the Characters off the scent, and maybe even get them away from Middenheim. </p>\n<p>As Zena, she rubs dust into her skin and hair to look beaten. She wears hardy, travel-stained clothes, and the remnants of a Delberz road warden’s uniform. </p>\n<p>If this plan works a little too well, a GM could clue the party into the fact that they have been tricked without exactly exposing Klaglich. When the party are miles north of Middenheim, she vanishes into the night, leaving them stranded in inhospitable terrain while she flees back to the city to regain control of the other folks she has tricked.</p>\n<p>Klaglich is an expert at disguise. To recognise that any of the above are the same person requires a specific inspection, and a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test. </p>\n<p>That said, there are several ‘tells’ that reveal her true identity. Anyone getting into conversation or glimpsing her full face notices her bright green eyes (+10 to <strong>Perception </strong>Tests to see through her disguise). </p>\n<p>Moreover, the carrier pigeons she uses to communicate with Wasmeier tend to drop feathers that get everywhere. There’s a good chance there are pigeon feathers on her clothes, despite her best efforts at disguise.</p>\n<h3>Schemes </h3>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} and Klaglich know exactly who has influence on the Graf, so they focused their plotting on the most critical NPCs. As a summary, here are the schemes that Klaglich used to secure support for the taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: She deals drugs to him in the guise of Frau Kenner. She has threatened to break off his supply if he does not support the new taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: Disguised as ‘Charlotte’, she hypnotised him on a night when he was drinking with friends. He now offers unthinking support for the taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Reiner Ehrlich} – Law Lord</strong>: Wasmeier arranged for a Chaos band to kidnap Ehrlich’s niece Reya and smuggle her into the city, where she is kept prisoner by Klaglich and her henchmen. The girl is now in the @JournalEntry[n2j6nlkc2s2LcieJ]{ruined house} that Klaglich uses as a hideout.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Klaglich obtained letters between Ar-Ulric and @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} that revealed an affair between the High Priest and the Graf ’s paramour. Disguised as Elise Kaltblutig, she blackmailed him into supporting the taxes.</p>\n<p>If the GM wants to add complexity to an already tricky scenario, Klaglich may fall back on alternative schemes, especially if the party are successfully building support to repeal the taxes:</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: Klaglich and Wasmeier know how the Graf dotes on his daughter. If forced to find additional support for the taxes, they implement a plot to blackmail the princess. Under cover of darkness, they smuggle Wasmeier’s henchman @Actor[GPmecH5STMzLNLc8]{‘Hawk’} into her chambers in a state of undress. Wasmeier then arranges for Klaglich (disguised as a palace guard) to ‘discover’ the princess with a dirty commoner. She threatens to tell the @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Chaperone Zimperlich} (impossible, of course) and the Graf about her shameful behaviour if Katarina does not support the taxes.  </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emanuelle Schlagen} – the Paramour</strong>: The Graf ’s paramour does not know that @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} is being blackmailed. If discovered, she would likely flee the city. However, Wasmeier knows she has influence over the Graf and can be manipulated if necessary. Through subterfuge, he and Klaglich hide a cache of papers and artefacts in her chambers. These implicate her as a cultist of Slaanesh, who seduced the Graf and Ar-Ulric through sorcerous wiles. Disguised as Kaltblutig, Klaglich threatens to reveal this to the Witch Hunters if Emanuelle does not support the taxes. Although the evidence is faked, it is very convincing and enough to get the paramour a biased ‘trial’ at the hands of the city’s religious authorities.</p>\n<h3>Her Actions </h3>\n<p>For simplicity’s sake, the GM may decide to use Klaglich just as a route to confronting Wasmeier, as outlined in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. It’s possible to give her more agency, where she can be used as an active opponent, working against the party’s actions as they get closer to success. Klaglich can be employed as the mirror image of @Actor[bUILl7b6hxsVqIqu]{Nastassia}, frustrating their progress if they’re advancing too easily.</p>\n<p><strong>Unaware</strong>: Before Klaglich finds out about the party, she continues her business as usual. She continues supplying the Chancellor, awaits Wasmeier’s instructions in the ruined house, and tries to keep his other servants out of trouble. She spends the rest of her time surreptitiously watching the major NPCs for signs of unexpected behaviour. In this situation, she may even be open to the party hiring her.</p>\n<p>The GM needs to decide when the party’s actions become apparent to Klaglich or @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}. Asking questions around the City Council or Guilds will do it if they’re indiscreet in talking about the taxes and their supporters.</p>\n<p><strong>Observing</strong>: When Brunhilde becomes aware of the party making enquiries, she starts spying on their movements. She adopts one of her disguises and watches them when they’re in public places, such as at the Carnival or the @JournalEntry[JAi2HLfYRkYwLC63]{Templar’s Arms}. A <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test reveals that someone is following or watching them.</p>\n<p><strong>Checking</strong>: Klaglich becomes more suspicious if she knows the Characters have met and discussed tax with any of the NPCs who have a weaker influence on the Graf — those with one influence ‘vote’ (@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Schmiedehammer}, @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Lafarel}, @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Zimperlich}, the @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Midden Marshals}, the @JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{Wizards}, @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}, or @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti}). If this happens, she works to increase the pressure on Ar-Ulric with another visit as Elise Kaltblutig, meets Schmiedehammer to test his hypnosis in the guise of ‘Charlotte’, and checks Ehrlich is still hiding in his house. The Characters could happen across her in any of these situations if they’re in the right place at the right time.</p>\n<p><strong>Thwarting</strong>: If the Characters meet with any of the most influential NPCs (the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina}, or @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Schlagen}) or look to have won more than seven ‘votes’ to influence the Graf, Klaglich takes direct action. She orders @Actor[klwNbpAHe1oQ1oo6]{Dagmar}, @Actor[frMWa4mngN7z7n3g]{Hultz}, or @Actor[eeJoYIenRt8CbtVU]{Anton} to ambush any Character who separates from the party. Wasmeier commands her to initiate one or more of the fallback schemes above, or adopt the role of Zena Kroll to meet the party and throw them off the scent.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovered</strong>: If the Characters discover Klaglich’s identity or follow her back to the ruined house where she is staying with her henchmen and the imprisoned Reya, follow the guidelines on @JournalEntry[n2j6nlkc2s2LcieJ]{The Lair of the Pawns}.</p>","folder":"udGynnL2hxddlr6Q","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":200000}}}
{"_id":"2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip","name":"The Taxes","content":"<p>Wasmeier has designed the taxes to be unjust, wishing to cause the maximum ill-will. Dwarfs and wizards are insulted: both groups have served the city for hundreds of years. The Temple Tax has caused the least upset so far, since the largest cult in Middenheim, that of Ulric, is effectively silenced by the tacit support shown by its High Priest.</p>\n<p>All three taxes are in two parts, one directed at individuals and the other aimed at institutions. They have been drawn up by expert lawyers so — while they may be unfair — they cannot be challenged on legal grounds. At the time of the adventure, the taxes have been in force for nearly a month.

{"_id":"2aOu8k1gNO1UgasZ","name":"Siegfried Prunkvoll","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/siegfried-prunkvoll.webp\" width=\"252\" height=\"255\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>As Siegfried loves to explain, the post of Knight Eternal has its origins in distant history. As he tells it, when Middenheim was first founded, a soothsayer predicted that the city must always be protected by a knight of great virtue and selflessness, selected by the most honest and brilliant men of the city. At once, a volunteer stepped forward; the people rejoiced and awarded him a stipend from the city’s coffers. The Knight Eternal — since such a protector would be needed for all time — was also given a magnificent white suit of magical plate mail created by the city’s wizards. Handed down from one Knight Eternal to the next, this armour became a badge of office.</p>\n<p>The first Knights Eternal were fine warriors, although it has been claimed that the first one just happened to be the soothsayer’s son, who was unemployed at the time. The post has lost much of its glory over the centuries, but no one wants to end the tradition. Siegfried actively campaigned for the post while the last Knight Eternal was struggling with a fatal illness, and succeeded largely for want of any better candidate.</p>\n<p>No court functions or duties are attached to the post, except that according to the prophecy, the Knight Eternal must always remain within Middenheim’s walls or a terrible fate will befall the city. Siegfried has no influence on @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris}.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Siegfried lives in the Outer Palace, but attends certain cultural events during Carnival week. He does not frequent informal or lowbrow events, markets, or other ‘common’ locations.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>A Character of high social class (for instance, in the Noble Career, or possessing the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.1IVGksL10N7GVrw3]{Noble Blood} Talent) who is well dressed and well spoken — or a lesser Character who can convincingly imitate these qualities — receives a bonus of up to +20 on all Fellowship Tests with Siegfried. Grimy, uncouth, and even plain spoken individuals are dismissed out of hand.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Siegfried knows nothing of any value, and talking to him will be a complete waste of time; persistent players may take a little while to realise this. If he detects the slightest whiff of any threat to Middenheim’s security, Siegfried will consider it his sacred duty to march in to the Graf and tell him all, and will insist that the Characters accompany him. He will not listen to any arguments in favour of delay, or gathering further information, or avoiding tipping the enemy off. The only way to stop him will be by force — which will convince him that the Characters, too, are part of a terrible plot to destroy the city.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Siegfried has little idea of who influences Graf Boris. He thinks, wrongly, that he has significant influence, and he believes that the @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Marshals} have more influence than they actually do. He refuses to believe that any female NPC could possibly have any influence over the Graf, clothing his chauvinistic views in pompous and mealy-mouthed chivalry.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>In his simplistic and misinformed way, Siegfried is devoted to his post and to Middenheim. While he regards financial discussions as sordid, he may reveal that he dislikes the Temple Tax, but is in favour of the other two: Dwarfs are inherently less noble than Humans, and wizards less noble than knights or priests.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>Siegfried is completely unaware that most other NPCs find him tedious or even ridiculous. In most cases, his opinions are based on the rank rather than the person.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam}— Chancellor</strong>: A good enough fellow, sound on antiques and history. Unfortunate that he must soil his hands with financial matters.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: A fine fellow, doing his best despite his low birth. When they meet, Siegfried’s forced display of good-fellowship is embarrassing.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Fine songs are well and good for diverting the ladies, but Siegfried doesn’t care for an Elf moving so freely among court’s feminine flowers.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘The Princess’</strong>: The highest lady in the land and a paragon of virtue. Siegfried attempts courtly compliments and the occasional dreadful poem, blind to their invariably disastrous results.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: A fine, dutiful lady. Their relationship is highly formal, perfectly mannered, and quite excruciatingly polite.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Fine fellows and great warriors, though lacking his own heroic qualities. Siegfried is quite unaware of their dislike of him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Sorcery is rather unchivalrous, though of course a wizard made his wonderful plate mail. Janna Eberhauer makes him uncomfortable — there is a term for female spellcasters, and it is not Deputy High Wizard.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: As a devoted follower of Sigmar, Siegfried is concerned that a priest of Ulric has the Graf ’s ear, even if that priest is also an Imperial Elector. However, he hardly knows Ar-Ulric, and will not criticise him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Siegfried treats them all with a condescending and impersonal chivalry. He is unaware of any affairs, and will be unable to process the information if he is told. However, he has failed to banish the memory of one lady (Petra, though he could not name her) making an improper suggestion to him despite his vow of chastity; rather than think her naturally capable of such sentiments, he puts the incident down to some aspect of the moons. He has heard that ladies are affected by such things.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Allavandrel has been abusive to Siegfried in the past, and the Knight Eternal loathes him. It is bad enough that the Graf must hunt with ragged countrymen, but an Elf in the hunt — as something other than quarry — is beyond bearing.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Knights do not consort with leech-handlers.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: No contact, but they are surely learned and worthy fellows, if bookish and dull.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Thinks him a fine servant and a credit to the court, but obviously one does not become familiar with a servant.

This year, owing to the Graf ’s indisposition, his daughter Katarina presents the cup to the winner.

In between rehearsals, the stars always make time for a special recital in which they show off their favourite arias for a select audience. For lovers of culture, this one-time event is a greater attraction than the operas themselves. The fact the event is only for a ‘select few’ ensures boasting and competition is rife. It’s now considered one of the only events worth being seen at.

Set in the Magrittan suburb of Vesille, the opera tells of a resourceful Norseman, Figg Arroson, who helps a lovestruck young noble rescue his beloved from the clutches of her uncle, who plans to marry her himself and keep the dowry left to her by his dead brother, her father.

The audience at this recital show their admiration of the performers by imitating their bizarrely-cut clothes, elaborate hairstyles, and lavishly-applied makeup. Those attending this recital are treated to performances by perennial favourites Adamantiel ‘Prince Charming’ Dandihyweiman, the Elven League, and the so-called ‘Wild Elves’ themselves, Duriandian Leboniel and his quintet (who plan to honour the city of Ulric with their popular ditty ‘Hungry Like the White Wolf ’).

Regarded as one of the most challenging operas to sing, and even more challenging to sit through, Rickard Wegener’s masterpiece is based on an old Norscan myth, appropriated by Wegener in the time of the Empire’s rebuilding under Magnus the Pious, with names and locations adapted accordingly. The complex plot deals with an ancient god who takes an unwelcome and meddlesome interest in an ancient warrior clan, causing great suffering and confusion for his own amusement.</p>\n<h4>This event is attended by the following NPCs</h4>\n<p><strong> Angestag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam}</p>\n<p>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich}</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}</p>\n<p>@Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Joachim Hoflich}</p>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}</p>\n<p>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller}</p>\n<p><strong>Festag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam}</p>\n<p>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildcganlc Zimperlich}</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}</p>\n<p>@Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Joachim Hoflich}</p>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}</p>\n<p>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/schedule-royal-college.webp","folder":"Kt6NUOTEx9m4NDNu","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Carnival Events","sort":0}}}

Dieter moves in high society because of what, not who, he is, but Graf Boris has always liked him, and he has modest influence (1 vote).</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Dieter is an easily accessible NPC. The easiest way of meeting the champion is to challenge him (see @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Carnival Events: Square of Martials}), but he attends many other events, and is often to be found wandering around markets, attending performances, etc. His carousing is limited by his need to be fighting fit on most mornings, when he may have to defend his title as the Graf ’s Champion. </p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: +5 to all Fellowship Tests. Dieter regards them as doughty fighters, worthy of respect.</p>\n<p><strong>Warriors</strong>: +10 to all Fellowship Tests made by Gold-status characters with at least one completed Warrior Career level.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Dieter and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} are engaged, they discuss people and events (which is how Dieter knows the latest gossip from the Ladies at Court). Also, Dieter has been hypnotised (see below) into speaking out in favour of the tax changes. In addition, Dieter remembers @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} the Minstrel enthusing about the Dwarf Tax.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Dieter thinks that the Midden Marshals have more influence with the Graf than they actually do; this is because his own conversations with the Graf — before his decline — have mostly been about military matters.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Dieter’s main goal is to marry his fiancée, @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} of the Ladies at Court. He plans to settle down as a blacksmith and horse-trader, have a family, and live a comfortable but quiet life. He will not miss high society with its gossip and back-biting, so the Characters must appeal to his sense of injustice and hatred of corruption if they wish to draw him into the developing intrigues.</p>\n<p>Dieter has been hypnotised to express enthusiasm for all of the tax changes if asked. <strong>Note</strong>: This contradicts his expressed admiration for Dwarfs, which — along with his parrot-like repetition of the responses he has been taught under hypnosis — may arouse suspicion.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Indifferent; hardly knows him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</strong> <strong>— Minstrel</strong>: A good friend and drinking companion. Dieter has a fondness for music. He tries to cheer Rallane up when needed, and commiserates with him when the Elf has had another of his unfortunate affairs. The two often go drinking with Allavandrel, Master of the Hunt.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</strong> <strong>— ‘Princess’</strong>: Very correct in his behaviour towards her. They do not meet often. He likes her, but thinks she is not too bright. Nonetheless, he will be slightly jealous of anyone who wins her affections, although he will try not to show it.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich}</strong> <strong>— Chaperone</strong>: He is oddly fond of the old dragon.  He is highly chivalrous towards her, gently teasing her formality in ways that make her smile. He knows she loves her charge, and that she has made many sacrifices for the Todbringer family over the years.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Dieter has friends in the military, but not in high places; he has trained many of those rising to prominence, and has good connections with them. He rarely meets the Marshals, but is sure they are honest and capable.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: No dealings with them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Knows him only indirectly, through court functions. While a few warrior friends revere Ulric, Dieter is not especially religious; he respects the title, but does not know the man.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: He has escorted her to court functions in past years (as is the case with all the Ladies at Court) and likes her. He does not know of her relationships with Graf Boris or Ar-Ulric.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: He is engaged to Kirsten Jung, and is wholly committed to her. He has often escorted all of the three Ladies at Court and likes them all; he won’t hear a word against them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</strong> <strong>— Knight Eternal</strong>: Thinks he is pompous and not much of a warrior, but won’t readily admit this in conversation. Defends him against criticism with equivocal excuses, but tries to avoid him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}</strong> <strong>— Master of the Hunt</strong>: Good friends. They enjoy friendly competitions, jousting, and archery, and often attend Carnival Week events together, often with Kirsten and/or Rallane Lafarel. Dieter worries that Allavandrel can sometimes be impulsive.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}</strong> <strong>— Komission Convenor</strong>: Wallenstein swindled Dieter over a pair of horses two months ago; he could not prove anything, and this still annoys him. Dieter remains convinced that Wallenstein is corrupt.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Knows him only by reputation: so strong opinions, but suspects he may be a quack, using Baron Stefan’s condition to advance his own social status.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Dieter has very few dealings with them, although he thinks them able enough people. He feels sorry for the painfully shy Reiner Ehrlich, but he has no particular feelings about the other two. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer:</strong> Met Sascha once when visiting a horse trader. He couldn’t quite work out why he was there, but they got on well enough.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Dieter is polite about Breugal when speaking to others, and when dealing with him in person. Privately, though, he thinks he is a little drunk on the power he has over the Graf ’s household, and would do better to see people as people, and not simply as the sum of their status and position.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Has a surprisingly congenial relationship with Edel. The role of Judicial Champion is technically a legal position and he was interested enough to ask Mueller about it. He finds her a little wry, but more engaging than he expected.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>He admires the High Matriarch’s quiet devotion to helping those in need and has made some small donations, but when they meet he has little to say to her.</p>\n<h3>Deadly Secret: Hypnotised!</h3>\n<p>While out drinking two months ago, Dieter found himself alone with a pretty woman who called herself Charlotte (actually a heavily disguised @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich}). As the two sat in a secluded tavern booth, she hypnotised him. Ever since then, Dieter repeats one of the following lines whenever the subject of taxes comes up: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘I think the Temple Tax is a good idea. Those priests have been stacking up gold for years. Look at the Temples!’</p>\n<p>‘Everyone knows the Wizards have chests of gold put away, and the Alchemists actually make the stuff!' </p>\n<p>'Dwarfs are thrifty people, very good with gold.

{"_id":"3sFdJskJYiLvUWkc","name":"Conclusion (Power Behind the Throne)","content":"<p>The villain has been exposed and the plot has been thwarted. Although he may have escaped, and a city gate and viaduct may have been devastated in the process, it is clear that the cult of the Purple Hand in Middenheim has suffered a terrible blow. The Watch take time to process documents found in Wasmeier’s house, an in the coming weeks raids in search of any remaining cultists intensify. Wasmeier, assuming he has survived the climax of the adventure, is licking his wounds and wondering how to inveigle himself back into society. Whilst he is a depraved follower of Tzeentch he has no desire to freeze and die in a northern wasteland - using the powers of Chaos to make himself comfortable within the echelons of Imperial power and majesty was the plan, after all. Many Purple Hand henchmen will be slain, and the Ordo Terribilis gutted, but the other two Ordos in Middenheim go to ground and weather the initial witch hunts. The Purple Hand through the rest of the Empire are unphased — indeed many of hear of @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier's} failure will smirk at his failed ambition and continue on their own plans, which will soon bear fruit.</p>\n<p>It is with a well-deserved sense of achievement, then, that the Characters return to @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{the Palace} to make their report. The Graf is clearly in their debt, and though the gratitude of royalty is fleeting, the immediate future holds the promise of great reward. When the Characters return from their attempt to apprehend Wasmeier they are met by a clearly impressed @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann} (if Schutzmann has been killed or compromised during the adventure one of the other Midden Marshals or @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} steps in). He shows concern for their wellbeing and sends for medical assistance if any of them are badly hurt. He suggests that they get some rest and refreshment and meet him the next afternoon at the @JournalEntry[uv75n0ftS1SPIHeA]{Laughing Jackass} so that he can debrief them. On a <strong>Difficult (-10) Intuition</strong> Test the Characters may get the impression that he is feeling guilty.</p>\n<h3>The Debrief</h3>\n<p>The next morning @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} meets the Characters and ensures that they are provided with refreshments before launching into a prolonged and exhaustive interogation them about their time in Middenheim. You may describe much of this in the abstract, but put each of the following questions to at least one of the Characters in turn, giving all a chance to answer at least one query — Schutzmann will be comparing their stories, after all.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who the Characters are and where have they come from?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>How did they come to know about the Purple Hand?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>What is their experience with the Purple Hand, and what do they know of the cult’s organisation and activities.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Given that Wasmeier’s body is yet to be recovered do they have any idea what may have become of him and where he may have gone?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Do the following terms mean anything to the Characters: 'Ordo Terribilis', 'Ordo Novitiae', 'Ordo Impedimentae', 'Magister Magistri', and 'The Nuln Cell?' Schutzmann's officers have made some progress in decoding Wasmeier's notes and journals, which is where Schutzmann learned the terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FLIPPING THE SCRIPT</em></h3>\n<p><em>Curious Characters will have their own questions for @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann}</em><em>, some of which have been anticipated below. Schutzmann is pleased with their efforts in defence of the city, and will attempt to answer most reasonable questions.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>If the characters show Schutzmann the letter they found in Wasmeier’s house he will look at it for a few seconds before explaining that the letter uses one of the groups easier codes, and can be deciphered by reading the letters after every underlined letter.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>If the Characters bring up the von Wittgensteins Schutzmann listens respectfully, but warns against the repetition of unsubstantiated slanders against Reikland nobility.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>If they mention Gotthard Wallenstein, he assures the Character's that his agents will look into it.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>If he knows anything about their encounters with Skaven he will take as much information as he can. He is sceptical, as many Middenheimers are, that a breed of rat-headed Beastmen exist as anything other than rare aberrations. He finds the notion that they pose an existential threat to Middenheim ridiculous, but as long as the Characters make a sincere report he records their account.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>The Offer</h4>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} has a good feeling about the Characters, but he does warn them that enemies of Middenheim might derive aid and comfort from finding out about the indiscretions or oversights of members of Middenheim’s ruling class. He suggests that, as capable and resourceful investigators, the Characters enter into an agreement with him. Provided they remain discrete, and provided they are willing to help him carefully investigate the the threat that the Purple Hand or the Skaven pose to Middenheim, he is willing to put certain material resources of the city watch at their disposal.</p>\n<p>Should they think to ask, the Characters will be provided with whatever non-magical equipment, weaponry or armour they might want. Accomodation at one of Middenheim’s finer hostelries is arranged, and a payment of @Credit[1gc EACH]{1 Gold Crown} a week will be made to each Character. He can be haggled up to @Credit[1gc6ss EACH]{1 GC 6/-} a week, though this lowers his opinion of the Characters.</p>\n<p>If a Character has earned a position as Champion to the Graf due to vanquishing @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} during the carnival @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} points out that the two roles are complementary. Indeed, it would be in the spirit of the Graf ’s Champion to defy threats to Middenheim in this way as long as the Graf has no particular duties he wishes his Champion to perform.</p>\n<h3>Consequences of Carnival Week</h3>\n<p>Middenheim’s high society has been through a dramatic week. The trauma of discovering that one of the city’s chief legislators and trusted courtiers almost usurped the throne in the name of a Ruinous Power inspires both anger and introspection.</p>\n<p>Almost immediately @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric Jarrick Valgeir} resigns and undertakes a lone pilgrimage to the far and freezing north. He never returns. His older brother, @Actor[sn0zk1QV53XMipVw]{Emil Valgeir}, takes on the mantle of Ar-Ulric. He is notably more proactive in the promotion of Ulrican values than Jarrick, and hardline Ulrican rhetoric is openly proclaimed from the pulpit of the High Temple. Due to his elevation Emil can no longer act as Grand Master of Middenheim’s @JournalEntry[gAju4PEyv8GeeJQX]{Order of the White Wolf}, and a grizzled campaigner named Rein Volkhard is takes his place.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Reiner Ehrlich} also retires. Replacements for the three Law Lords are drawn from senior clerks at the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists}, Eberhardt Richter, Erich Kalzbad, and Hannes Brucker. They are sincere, solemn and rather tedious men who take great pains to avoid political entanglements.</p>\n<p>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsum} manages to retain his position as Chancellor following a severe reprimand and orders to seek treatment for his addiction and collaborate in a constructive and respectful way on projects managed by @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}. </p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}, if he retains his title as Champion, soon comes to an agreement with the Graf to take on a suitable protégé and train them to replace him. The new champion is chosen from those who gave Dieter a hard fight during the carnival, and may well be one of the Characters. He and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} are swiftly married. Dieter may occasionally utter strange opinions on taxation if his hypnosis has not been treated.</p>\n<p>After retiring from her courtly duties for a short while @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} leaves Middenheim for Altdorf. She tells anyone who questions her decision that she wishes to make a return to the stage, and regards Altdorf ’s theatrical scene as a promising prospect.</p>\n<p>Baron @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan Todbringer} continues to require the care of physicians. @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}, provided he has not too thoroughly disgraced himself, remains a valued courtier in the eyes of most of Middenheim’s high society.</p>\n<p>Baron @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich Todbringer} remains in Wolfenburg. Rumours suggest that whilst his input is having a moderating effect on tensions between Ostland and Talabecland, he is just delaying the onset of hostilities rather than preventing them.</p>\n<p>Graf @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Boris Todbringer} becomes increasingly active and engaged, gradually returning to his old self. He takes up hunting again, and there is talk that he has turned one eye toward the military adventuring he was famed for in his youth.</p>\n<p>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’ Katarina} seems to have been shocked out of her complacency due to the events of carnival week. The court is abuzz with gossip of how she is far more willing to exercise her influence than before. If the Characters encounter her they find her to be distinctly more confident and curious in her manner.</p>\n<p>Courtly life being what it is, not everyone is wholly pleased with these developments, but the general mood is one of revitalisation and optimism.</p>\n<p>The Characters are acknowledged for the part they have had to play, even if much of it remains a secret. While in Middenheim, the Characters’ Status becomes 3 higher than it would otherwise be (so Silver 4 becomes Gold 2, for example), and the Characters are made welcome at the court by those who know of their services to the Graf and Middenheim. </p>\n<p>While no impressive sums of gold or lavish titles are offered in reward, it should not take much for clever Characters to turn their new found status to their advantage. As long as this is done with discretion and respect, few at the court will complain.</p>\n<h3>Preparing For The Horned Rat</h3>\n<p>The next instalment of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong> is <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. The events of this adventure can occur directly after the resolution of <strong>Power Behind the Throne </strong>(and this will be easier for GMs to manage), but they can also occur after a period of respite for the Characters. </p>\n<p>The Horned Rat deals with the results of Wasmeier’s cooperation with Skaven. Certain of these creatures are developing an understanding of Dagmar von Wittgenstein’s insights into the movements of Morrslieb (see <strong>Death on the Reik</strong> for more information about Dagmar’s research) and intend to put this understanding to use.</p>\n<p>In order for the remaining parts of The Enemy Within campaign to progress smoothly you ought to keep the following things in mind.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>REQUIREMENTS</em></h3>\n<p><em>While some creativity will allow a canny GM to continue with <strong>The Enemy Within</strong> in most eventualities, certain outcomes are strongly recommended, and you should try to ensure the following remains true once the Carnival has drawn to a close.</em></p>\n<p><em>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier} still lives, and lies low in a hidden Drakwald lair for the time being.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Characters remain in the vicinity of Middenheim, and on good terms with at least some of the major NPCs.</em></p>\n<p><em>Whilst many low-ranking members of the Purple Hand are caught and killed, Senior Cult Magi Gottfried Jarmund and Erich Kalzbad keep their heads low and remain undiscovered.</em></p>\n<p><em>Purple Hand cells in other parts of the Old World, whilst suspected, are not uncovered.</em></p>\n<p><em>Whilst evidence of Skaven activity may be found, they remain a plausibly deniable menace to the city.

Since the fighter is allowed no armour except a shield, only the bravest warriors take part. The @Actor[4iMDGr19M9tUx1SW]{Minotaur} is armed with a two-handed club. This year there are three Minotaurs in prime fighting condition, and in between bouts there will be lesser bouts pitting visiting warriors against captured Beastmen and other creatures. Two of the Minotaurs are already booked; one by the Dwarf @Actor[7qgDlG8BryDHpn4a]{Glugnur} and the other by Alchred von Hintz, a young, impoverished noble from Altdorf.

Ticket prices range from @Pay[2bp]{2 brass pennies} to @Pay[10ss]{10 silver shillings}, depending on the quality — or presence — of the seating. The winner of a Minotaur fight gains general public respect for the duration of the Carnival, and is noticed by the Midden Marshals and by any other major NPCs attending the event.</p>\n<p>If the challenger loses the fight by being reduced to zero Wounds, a number of trained ‘bullies’ leap into the ring.  They try to entice the Minotaur away before it starts eating its victim and enters a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.yRhhOlt18COq4e1q]{Frenzy}. Betting on Minotaur fights is fast and furious, and for outsiders the odds are generally based on species: Dwarfs 2:1; Humans 3:1, Elves 3:1, and Halflings 15:1.

Supposedly based on ancient Teutogen fire rituals in the seat of their ancient kings, it was the spectacle of the year; ever since then fire-breathers have flocked to the town.

Since the Graf has been uninterested in the hunt for some months, Allavandrel is bored. He has no influence with the Graf in political matters, although he could if he wished — politics simply do not interest him. However, he does see the Graf moderately often.</p>\n<p>Locations</p>\n<p>Allavandrel has a town house in the @JournalEntry[UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor} district. He attends many Carnival events, and is easy to encounter at the @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tourney} or at various hostelries, ranging from swanky to dangerous.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Elves</strong>: +10 to all Fellowship Tests. While he and @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} are fast friends, he longs for more Elven company.</p>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: –10 to all Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Halflings</strong>: +5 to all Fellowship Tests. Allavandrel employs a talented and friendly Halfling housekeeper, called Cordelia Greenhill, and he has developed a soft spot for the little folk thanks to her example.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Allavandrel knows who influences @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris}, but not much more. However, the sociable Elf is well-connected and can provide introductions to @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane}, the Ladies at Court, and possibly even the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}. He may know where someone (such as the Chancellor) might obtain more exotic substances (see ‘@JournalEntry[mNMoXXZJKYGjXH7O]{The Harmacist},’), although he will be worried if the Characters specifically name the Chancellor in this regard. A solid fighter and outstanding archer, he might also be of direct, adventuring, help to the Characters, but only if this is absolutely necessary.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Allavandrel has a fair idea of who influences the Graf, although he is inclined to overestimate the influence of the @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Marshals} and @JournalEntry[O1WGhtHQNazslML1]{Ar-Ulric}.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Allavandrel likes the idea of a Dwarf Tax, but knows it will lead to trouble: he is unhappy that Rallane is being blamed, and would like to see his friend exonerated on this score. He has no opinion about the other taxes. Knowing that the Graf is ailing, and the city is vulnerable, he wonders whether he should become more active politically.</p>\n<p>The Elf has a taste for adventure. He knows that Baron @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich} thinks well of him, and he is not blind to the fact that Heinrich would make a fine Graf. He is wise enough to know that such thoughts may not be spoken, but he would encourage any Character who seemed to share in this notion. Given the Graf ’s condition, surely the time for action cannont be more than a year or two away. However, he won’t take any overt risks.</p>\n<p>During Carnival week, Allavandrel’s main goal is retain his archery title, and to have as much fun as possible: high life at night, possibly helping the Characters by day with information and introductions to other NPCs. However, he will talk the matter over with @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} first, and only after the Characters have made some appreciable headway on their own.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Allavandrel has always felt a little sorry for him, feeling that this honest but painfully shy man is not a bad fellow if given a chance. He has taken the trouble to rescue Sparsam from social embarrassment once or twice, but their relations are still formal. Allavandrel has not been in a position to notice any odd behaviour or signs of addiction.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: A good friend and drinking companion, Allavandrel enjoys Dieter's company above most other humans. Dieter and Allavandrel have not discussed the tax changes, but he was surprised to learn of Dieter’s expressed views from Rallane.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Very close friends, they wine, dine, and sing together, and encourange each other in the pursit of occassional but always memorable romances. Allavandrel is rather more steady and realistic than Rallane, and often ends up having to escort the minstrel home after a heavy night.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘The Princess’</strong>: Thinks her naïve, but kindly and charitable.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: He is indifferent to her, but treats her courteously.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: He knows von Genscher very slightly, but has no strong feelings about them.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: No dealings. He would be pleased to learn that Janna Eberhauer finds him attractive.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: No dealings. Allavandrel is not overly interested in human religious practices, though is inclined to sympathy with the cults of Taal and Rhya.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: Friends, on and off, for some years; they have enjoyed the occasional dalliance, but never more. Allavandrel is glad of this,  since he now strongly suspects that Emmanuelle is the Graf ’s Paramour. He knows nothing of her affair with Ar-Ulric, but suspects from her demeanour that there may be someone else.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Friendly with Kirsten and Petra, and has sometimes enjoyed a long evening with Petra. He has also escorted them about town many times.  He doesn’t like Natasha, thinking her cold and joyless.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Allavandrel finds him ridiculous, and will insult him to anyone who listens.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Does not know him personally, but knows from Dieter that the man is a crook, and knows from others that he treats women badly: both things Allavandrel dislikes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: They have met only once, and that was briefly. As it happened, Luigi was very quiet at the time, and they had a brief conversation about court affairs. Based on this one meeting, Allavandrel feels that the Tilean cannot be as bad as his reputation suggests.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: No dealings. He knows them only by reputation, but imagines they must be rather stuffy.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer: </strong>The Elf knows Rothbert as a casual acquaintance who can be good company and always knows a good hostelry when they need one.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Allavandrel only rarely crosses paths with Breugel, and has no particular opinion of him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[KZjUllCfHJl4kZ2F]{Thognar}- The Clerk</strong>: Allavandrel does not know Thognar well, but has had dealings with the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission of Elf, Dwarf, and Halfling Interests} in the past and is aware of his petition. If the Characters express concerns about the taxes to Allavandrel, he suggests they see the Dwarf. However, he would cool towards Thognar if he knew of Thognar’s conspiratorial talk about Rallane.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Allavandrel has no dealings with Mueller.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>No dealings.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts},  @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag: </strong>@JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag:</strong> @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag:</strong> @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Horse Fair}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag: </strong>@JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Elven Lightsingers}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 4}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag:</strong> @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Semi-Final 1}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag:</strong> @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Water Polo Tournament}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Snotball Final}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag: </strong>@JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/allavandrel-fanmaris.webp","folder":"So1PdVn4b7FXXZLo","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"6Lr7N7BpeiqOSla3","name":"Initial Inquiries","content":"<p>Given the scheme laid out in @JournalEntry[efYPFvLrN0nHN2tq]{Chapter 3: The Evil} Plot, curious Characters will soon discern that something sinister is afoot in the City of the White Wolf. After having arrived in Middenheim, dealt with the Purple Hand ambush, and encountered @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} evil plot, the Characters probably want to learn more about the cult and try to destroy it. They may also want to find @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard von Wittgenstein} and expose the Slaanesh cult of which he is a member. When they first encounter Skaven (@JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{‘Chaos Strikes by Night’}), they will probably want to pursue them as well, having been frustrated in their previous encounter in Castle Wittgenstein. The last thing they will be expecting is to be drawn into a plot to bring down the city by manipulating its most powerful citizens.</p>\n<p>This plot is detailed in the rest of this book. The Purple Hand, the Skaven, and the errant Gotthard von Wittgenstein are all involved to some extent or another: following one or another of these lines of inquiry leads to the adventure’s main plot, and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>These initial investigations probably take place in the two days before Carnival week begins, as the Characters start to find their way around Middenheim. Optionally, they may have the chance to encounter some of the more sociable and less reclusive major NPCs at this stage, such as the Graf ’s Champion, the Ladies-at-Court, the Master of the Hunt, and the Court Minstrel — but only if the Characters are in the right kind of place at the right kind of time (see @JournalEntry[zm2zG5Tw0uj9H3ao]{‘Encountering NPCs’})</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: FOLLOW THAT PLOT!</em></h3>\n<p><em>'The last thing they (the Players) will be expecting,’ says the first paragraph of this chapter, ‘is to be drawn into a plot to bring down the city by manipulating its most powerful citizens.’ If they are veterans of the first edition campaign, though, this will be the first thing they are expecting. They may ignore everything else, and start trying to make court connections straight away — which, while it does not break the adventure, does take something away from the experience. Here are some suggestions for GMs who find this happening.</em></p>\n<p><em>The grognard boxes @JournalEntry[Y2Tz145Dqgfl1Chf]{'The Villain'} and @JournalEntry[Y2Tz145Dqgfl1Chf]{'Deadly Secrets'} offer options for making changes that will restore the challenge of this adventure to players who have already completed it. Once players realise that the roles of various major NPCs have been shuffled, they will be more willing to go back to first principles, and begin an investigation from scratch.</em></p>\n<p><em>Even if the players remain convinced that they know which NPCs are the best ones to approach, the problem remains of engineering a suitable introduction. The section @JournalEntry[zm2zG5Tw0uj9H3ao]{‘Encountering NPCs’} shows just how valuable each of the major NPCs can be in this regard, and how easy or difficult each one is to meet.</em></p>\n<p><em>Having secured a meeting, the Characters must be able to convince a major NPC that they know what is going on — which means they must be able to speak knowledgeably about the situation, making a good case for their suspicions, and presenting convincing evidence. This is very hard to do if the players are working from a distant memory, or if they have not established a level of trust and renown by dealing with other matters.</em></p>\n<p><em>Even if the identity of the villain does not change, and other details remain the same as they were in the first edition, the Characters find it more difficult to leap frog the early parts of the adventure than grognard players may suppose. The adventure becomes less about how the Characters can find out the truth — although they still need to do so, whatever their respective players may know or remember — and more about how well they work their way into Middenheim’s high society. This offers a different challenge, and one that the players may not be expecting.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"Ve1StDqEHdnywAsd","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 4: Initial Inquiries","sort":100000}}}
{"_id":"7b3n85kojlLKSpkT","name":"Initial Inquiries: Gotthard von Wittgenstein","content":"<p>The name of von Wittgenstein means nothing to anyone in Middenheim: the family’s castle and lands are too far away for the name to be familiar, and Gotthard adopted the alias ‘@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}’ when he moved to the city. Further, the Characters have only a vague idea of what he looks like from a portrait they may have seen @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.1wRb1a5Tku2t0UvL]{in the castle}. This need not be the case, however. Though it is certainly desirable that the Characters do not identify him too soon, the search for the last of the Wittgensteins can add depth and intrigue to the adventure, and offer you some ways to help a party that is having difficulty.</p>\n<p>There are several carnival events at which the Characters might catch a glimpse of Gotthard: all are listed on his NPC card, and all are attended by other major NPCs, whose acquaintance the Characters may be keen to make — especially as the week goes on. While Gotthard is not particularly friendly with any of the others, a party following them around will certainly have a chance to see him. While his face may not be familiar, any character who comes within 2 yd or so may be allowed a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test to notice that he wears a ring with the Wittgenstein coat of arms on the little finger of his right hand. The Character  remembers seeing the same coat of arms in Castle Wittgenstein, and may also remember that in his portrait, Gotthard wore the same ring.</p>\n<p>If a chance encounter seems too random, then the Characters might see Gotthard at an event — the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party} would be ideal — subjecting one of the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{ladies-at-court} to unwelcome attention. Spurred by gallantry — and by the desire to place an influential NPC in their debt — the Characters go to the rescue, spotting the telltale ring in the process.</p>\n<p>Another option is to encounter Gotthard through his involvement with the @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{Jade Sceptre cult}. Having learned of the cult’s existence from a captured Purple Hand cultist (see above) or by some other means, the Characters may conclude from Gotthard’s letter to his sister, and from the chapel to Slaanesh in the castle, that Gotthard is likely to be a member. Careful investigation could lead the Characters to the location of a private party: watching the place, they may see Gotthard going in.</p>\n<p>Armed with the knowledge that the city’s most influential merchant is a member of a cursed family masquerading under a false name, and/or that he is a member of a Slaanesh-worshipping Chaos cult, the Characters may decide to approach him and threaten blackmail. This leads to the question: what exactly do they want with Gotthard? The party might not have thought of this until now, but he can tell them little about his family that they do not already know, having been away for so long. If he learns that his family is dead and their castle destroyed, Gotthard takes any opportunity to get away. He hires assassins to kill the Characters, and remains in hiding until he is sure they have succeeded.</p>\n<h3>The Wallenstein Identity</h3>\n<p>Ideally, the Characters should learn of Gotthard’s true identity early on Festag night, at a time when they are preoccupied with the main plot of the adventure. If they see him out and about, it is always in crowded public places where they have little chance of approaching him directly.</p>\n<p>Once they learn that ‘Wallenstein’ is the chairman of an influential guild and a powerful city Komission, they realise — with the aid of a <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Law)</strong> or similar Test if necessary — that it would be very unwise to accuse such a prominent citizen of anything without overwhelming proof, and several other prominent citizens to back them up.</p>\n<p>Since he publicly supports the new taxes, the Characters would do well to begin their investigation of him there, especially if they already know or suspect that the Purple Hand is involved in the taxes (see above). This strategy enables them to gather evidence before making an accusation, and along the way they  are able to make the acquaintance of other powerful NPCs, and discover the plot to replace @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris}.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A DASH OF PARANOIA</em></h3>\n<p><em>While the Jade Sceptre doesn’t share the Purple Hand's penchant for colour coordination, your players may not realise this.

The Garden Party provides an opportunity for Characters to engage in this kind of activity, and while it may feel that little is being accomplished, be sure to gauge your players attitude to events. If they are enjoying themselves sneaking about the hedge maze, drinking with Luigi or gossiping with Petra, allow things to proceed. If, however, they seem at a loose end, be prepared to move things along. Hint at some of the key intrigues which contribute to the plot — the Graf's troubled mind, Ar-Ulric's affair, or Deiter's bizarre habit of repeating himself over the matter of the taxes, and move on. </em></p>\n<p><em>This is good advice to keep in mind during any of the Carnival's events. <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> was designed with the knowledge that not every group of Characters will see everything that is to be seen and uncover every detail of the plot. There are many paths to gaining influence with the Graf, and it is intended that each group find their own way to the core of the plot. If your players seem disinterested in one event, let them peruse the carnival calendar. There is certain to be something that draws their eye, and other opportunities will arise for the plot to bubble to the surface.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Mingling</h4>\n<p>Most of the guests at the garden party are here to mingle. Throughout the event guests wander about the garden, briefly and politely acknowledging other guests. In general it is considered polite to allow those of noble birth to decide whether or not to continue a conversation beyond a brief greeting. So burghers, artisans, performers, and the like tend to wander around at a fairly brisk pace, networking briefly with people they encounter, whilst aristocrats engage in deeper conversation if they feel like it. Characters would be wise to know that complaining about being treated with snobbish disregard is a good way to be asked to leave the party.</p>\n<p>Characters who mingle may still overhear some interesting titbit of information, though not from the mouths of any major NPC. A character who announces they are going to spend half an hour mingling should make a<strong> Hard (–20) Gossip</strong> Test and refer to the Mingle Outcome table (this becomes an <strong>Easy (+40) Gossip </strong>Test if the character has the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (Nobles)} Talent). If multiple characters mingle successfully at once they gain multiple pieces of information, rather than just overhearing the same snippet. Refer to @JournalEntry[ri289tDcFl3qOsaT]{rumours} from <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> if you need extra things to overhear.</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.0712%;height:171px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:27px\">\n<td style=\"width:99.5314%;height:27px\" colspan=\"3\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">MINGLE OUTCOME TABLE</h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:11.6005%;height:16px;text-align:center\"><strong>SL</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:21.354%;height:16px;text-align:center\"><strong>Result</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:66.5769%;height:16px\"><strong>Consequences</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:11.6005%;height:16px;text-align:center\">+6 or more</td>\n<td style=\"width:21.354%;height:16px;text-align:center\">Astounding Success</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.5769%;height:16px\">\n<p>The Character overhears Emmeline Helstein, a local noblewoman, discussing recent events with Abu Tawb, a diplomatic envoy from the Spice Port of Copher.

{"_id":"7yPxqLqUFRNauqHG","name":"Into The Sewers","content":"<p>Beneath the hole, a rusty, iron-runged ladder leads down a narrow shaft for 10 yards or so, finally emerging in a rough-hewn stone corridor. The course of the adventure from this point depends very much on what has happened to Tavelli.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} Escaped</h3>\n<p>If he has successfully managed to escape down the shaft, he returns to Skretth immediately and reports what has happened. He only mentions the Characters if they are pursuing him, giving the Skaven time to ready for the Characters and step up the guard around the sacrificial chamber, so that when the time for the ritual (midnight) comes, it is much harder for the Characters to ruin it.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} Killed</h3>\n<p>If the Characters killed Tavelli, or if he killed himself, he will not be missed for some time — with the impending sacrifice, the Skaven have more important things to worry about.</p>\n<p>@Actor[XviXu9z4RMAv0tmo]{Skretth’s} experiments have not been going well. He really has no idea how to achieve his goal, and he is beginning to worry that his followers will soon lose patience. Apart from anything else, he is constantly under the influence of Mandrake, and rational thought (in so far as a Grey Seer is ever capable of it) is far beyond him.</p>\n<p>The guard around the sacrificial chamber is not increased, and consequently the Characters’ task is made a little easier. Any attempt to impersonate Tavelli by wearing his clothes imparts a +20 bonus to any relevant Skill: the Skaven have difficulty telling one Man-thing from another, and they can seldom be bothered to try. Even so, there are several parts of the complex where Humans are not permitted, and trying to enter them will arouse suspicion. The cultists know exactly where they can and cannot go.</p>\n<h3>What Now?</h3>\n<p>From this point on, the action is dependent on where the Characters go. They are racing against time, so the GM should keep a careful record of elapsed game time.</p>\n<p>The rock corridor in which the Characters are standing is pitch black, without enough light for Night Vision to be effective. They will be spending some time underground, so the party risks becoming stranded in the sewers in the dark if they do not take enough oil or spare torches. If the Characters decide to turn back to acquire light sources, remember that the ritual begins at midnight.</p>\n<p>The corridor and branching passages are, rather disturbingly, filled with the echoes of strange, far-off noises. The walls glisten with moisture, and a greenish slime is present in some places. The air is distinctly cool. The GM should try to convey an atmosphere of foreboding.</p>\n<p>The corridor is quite low (about 6 feet high), so tall Characters have to duck to avoid hitting their heads against the ceiling. The floor is covered with a shallow layer of slippery mud: any movement faster than walking speed requires an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test to avoid falling over.</p>\n<h4>They Went Thataway</h4>\n<p>A clear trail marks the path taken by the cultists: no Test is necessary to make it out. There are two sets of footprints, with two continuous, roughly parallel furrows between them. A successful <strong>Easy (+40) Track </strong>Test leads a Character to conclude that the furrows were made by the heels of someone who was unconscious or overpowered, being dragged backwards by the elbows between two abductors.</p>\n<p>The tracks eventually lead to a dead end: a wall of moist, smooth stonework. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test reveals a scratched design in the wall, which an <strong>Average (+20) Secret Signs (Thief) </strong>Test identifies as meaning ‘push’. Pushing the wall at this point opens a secret door leading into the sewers. The door may be closed by pushing the stone as it protrudes from the other side: it repositions the counterweight mechanism that opens the door.</p>\n<h4>Wandering off the Trail</h4>\n<p>Should the party decide to ignore the obvious trail (see below) and take one of the side passageways instead, they soon become lost in the labyrinth of @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Middenheim’s Undercity}: a terrifying, twisting maze that winds away in every direction. No further details of the side branches are given, but if needed, you can find more information on the Undercity in <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</strong>. It should quickly become clear to the Characters that the further into the tunnels they go, the more danger they face. All manner of pitfalls and wandering, mutated creatures await the unwary, and the party could wander endlessly, slowly dying of starvation, lack of water, and festering wounds.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>DIGGING TOO DEEP</em></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">@JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{The Undercity} of Middenheim is vast. Beneath the upper areas carefully, and often thanklessly, patrolled by the dwarfs, lie ancient warrens carved by the first settlers of the Fauschlag. These halls are home to many horrors, as discussed above. Various elemental creatures drawn to the place by the strength of Ghur in Middenheim stalk the caverns, and give pause even to the Skaven.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Beneath these layers is the Skaven den of @JournalEntry[YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim}. Discussed in more detail in <strong>Middednheim: City of the White Wolf</strong>, these halls are ruled by a triumvirate of tyrants whose cruelty is all but unmatched. Should the Characters make it this far they are all but certain to die without the expenditure of a Fate point. Be sure to give the Characters plenty of warning that they are threading towards danger — foul smells, interminable sounds, and the skittering of many unseen paws over stone floors should abound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Should the Characters proceed all the same, feel free to throw any number of Skaven and Skaven-bred monstrosities at them. Regardless of their skill, armaments, or preparations they may have taken, no small group of Characters can hope to take on Skavendom directly and survive. If you are feeling generous allow them a glimpse at the vast and terrifying caverns full of uncountable rat-men, and then start looking at the Character's Doomings to see what sort of fate the Skaven are planning for each of them.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">If they do decide to run, there are reasons to be merciful. The Skaven will give chase, but not into the upper caverns patrolled by Dwarfs or filled with horrors even the Skaven wish to avoid. While this may be a case of 'out of the frying pan and into the fire', most Characters will stand a better chance facing off against a single monstrosity than against a veritable tide of well-armed vermin.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Dark, Damp, and Deadly Locations</h3>\n<p>The major encounter areas are detailed below. As the whole area below the cellar has been taken over by the Skaven and their servants, there is an 80% chance of encountering someone or something for every 10 minutes spent here. Roll 1d10 and consult the @Table[sewer-locations] table, or choose an option you prefer.</p>\n<h4>1. Sewer Entrance</h4>\n<p>The secret door leads into the sewers proper. The walls are made of dull grey stone and glisten with moisture (although this time there is no slime). The sewers, like the corridor leading into them, are pitch dark. In this part of the system, the sewers are roughly 10 feet wide, including narrow stone walkways 2 and a half feet wide, on each side of the effluent channel. The channel is 5 feet deep and half-filled with slow-flowing muck. See @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.pXSQdRzX2VCa8zMG]{Adventuring In The Sewers} in <strong>Enemy in Shadows </strong>for advanced rules and more ideas on exploring sewers.</p>\n<p>A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Track</strong> Test allows the party to follow the route taken by the cultists to the second secret door. Even if this is not successful, the Characters realise on a successful <strong>Easy (+40) Intelligence</strong> Test that although it is possible for one person to leap or wade the effluent channel, it would be practically impossible for two men dragging an unconscious or dead person, and any attempt to do so would certainly leave some sort of trail. Therefore, their quarry must have kept to this side of the channel. To the left, the channel could go on for some way, maybe even forking once or twice. However, due to other effluent channels crossing the path, or build-ups of detritus that would have given away anyone passing through, it should be obvious that the abductors did not pass this way.</p>\n<h4>2. The Ghoul</h4>\n<p>The party sees a humanoid body slumped face down over the walkway, one arm dangling over the edge. It is dressed in rags, and lies unmoving. The figure is, in fact, a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.6B7LMdYtunAftsFN]{Crypt Ghoul}, which was attracted here by the smell of dead Human flesh. It began to explore the area, but came across a Skaven patrol that attacked it immediately. The Skaven easily overpowered the miserable creature and left it for dead. However, it is currently on the verge of regaining consciousness. The Crypt Ghoul currently has 4 Wounds remaining.</p>\n<p>The Ghoul does not come to unless one of the Characters touches it. Due to previous Critical Hits inflicted by the Skaven patrol, it cannot walk, and must remain @Condition[Prone]. Even if the Characters kill it, it serves one useful purpose: to indicate that the abductors did not come this far. It would clearly have been impossible to drag an unconscious Human past even a wounded Ghoul.</p>\n<h4>3. Entrance to Skaven Den</h4>\n<p>The secret door opens into a rock corridor branching off to the right. The trail disappears into the wall here. If the Characters have lost the trail due to a failed Track Test, a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test is required to find the secret door. If the Characters miss the door and continue past, have a patrol of Skaven (as above) exit through the secret door as they are about to pass it by again after dealing with the Ghoul.</p>\n<p>The corridor beyond slopes upwards at a steep angle (evident to anyone entering it), levelling out as it reaches the guard chamber (see below). Halfway along, just before the bend in the passage, is a tripwire. Any Character approaching it spots it on a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test. If it goes undetected, each Character passing by it must make a <strong>Difficult (–10) Agility</strong> Test or unwittingly trigger it.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Measures</strong></p>\n<p>If the tripwire is triggered, two things happen: a bell rings in the guard chamber, alerting the cultists there; and a small glass globe drops to the floor, releasing a yellowish gas that initially fills a 2-yard radius centred on the unfortunate who triggered the trap. The gas spreads another 2 yards in all directions each Round for [[/r 1d10]] halved Rounds. Anyone caught in the gas must pass a <strong>Hard (–20) Toughness</strong> Test or fall unconscious for [[/r 1d10]] minutes — they may repeat this test if they suffer more wounds than their <strong>Toughness Bonus</strong>.</p>\n<p>After the gas has dispersed (which takes as many Rounds as it took to spread), the guards from area 4 take any unconscious Characters and throw them in the cells in area 6. If any Characters are unaffected by the gas, the guards seek to subdue them with their clubs: all have Strike to Stun. They avoid killing the Characters due to Skretth’s instructions to acquire sacrificial victims.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are subdued, refer to <strong>Captured!</strong> below.</p>\n<h4>4. Guard Chamber</h4>\n<p>This rough-hewn cavern serves as the common room and guard chamber for the Skaven’s cultist servants. There are a couple of tables and some chairs in the north-eastern part of the room; two sets of bone dice and a pack of cards lie on the tables. Illumination is provided by four torches mounted on the walls.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} managed to escape, he is here (unless the party is hot on his trail, in which case he is in area 9, reporting to @Actor[XviXu9z4RMAv0tmo]{Skretth}).</p>\n<p>There are 2–8 @Actor[DfOuLQkGzWUZPTXI]{Yellow Fang Cultists} in the room at all times. Their actions depend on whether or not the party triggers the tripwire in area 3. If they have avoided it, the guards are sitting at the table playing cards and the Characters can Surprise them, gaining Advantage. The guards are naturally suspicious, making any opposed <strong>Charm/Cool</strong> Test <strong>Difficult (–10)</strong> for the Characters if they try to bluff their way through instead of fighting.</p>\n<p>These guards know @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli}, and if one of the Characters is wearing the cultist’s clothes, the guards immediately recognise them as an imposter.</p>\n<p>The noise of any fighting here alerts the Skaven sentries in area 7, who attempt to ambush and capture any intruders who come into their area (the Skaven Surprise the Characters when they enter).</p>\n<h4>5. Armoury and Store Room</h4>\n<p>This small cave serves as a makeshift armoury for the guards in area 4. It contains five @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.1zaqojk0Oq1m8vYv]{Swords}, six @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.ahlxlfIl8xUhBkic]{Daggers}, three @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.1zaqojk0Oq1m8vYv]{Hand Axes}, two flasks of oil, two @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.aVLjCqY3guj1DD06]{tinderboxes}, and eleven torches. The weapons are all arranged in wooden weapon racks set against the walls, and the torches, oil, and tinderboxes are stacked neatly in a corner.</p>\n<h4>6. Corridor and Cells</h4>\n<p>This dismal corridor is accessible from the guardroom by a sturdy oak door. There are nine cells, each with a small barred window in the door. It requires a <strong>Difficult (–10) Strength</strong> Test to break down a door, or a successful Extended (3 SL) <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Test to pick the lock on any door. Of course, the jailer has the keys to the cells.</p>\n<p>Only seven of these cells are used as such. The westernmost cell holds any equipment taken from captured Characters, and is always locked. The easternmost cell is the jailer’s den, crudely furnished with a chair and a makeshift table on which stands a bottle of cheap Estalian wine. The other cells are rat-infested holes with damp straw on the floor in place of a bed. The only light comes from a single lantern hanging in the corridor.</p>\n<h4>7. Junction</h4>\n<p>The northern passageway from the guard room splits into two at this point. Standing at the junction are two @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.F1vAZZcmVKkRw8xn]{Clanrat} sentries. Humans are only allowed past them if they have been sent for by @Actor[XviXu9z4RMAv0tmo]{Skretth}— the Characters will either have to bluff or fight their way past. These Skaven believe that no pathetic Man-thing would dare go to Skretth uninvited, so they are not too difficult to bluff, requiring only a successful <strong>Average (+20) Charm </strong>Test. Fighting here alerts Skretth if he is in his chamber.</p>\n<h4>8. Shrine</h4>\n<p>The shrine consists of an altar flanked by two crudely sculpted statues of the Horned Rat, standing about 8 feet tall. The symbol of three bones forming an inverted triangle has been chiselled into the rock wall behind the rough stone altar. The roof is supported by four stone columns, and there is a small pit in front of the altar where the sniveling Skaven throw offerings to their deity. The pit is a natural narrow shaft, about 3 feet in diameter, which disappears downward out of sight. If anything is lost in here, the shaft is effectively bottomless; if a Character falls in, they become wedged about 4 feet down, and need to be pulled out. Any Tests made to rescue a Character or climb out are <strong>Challenging (+0).</strong></p>\n<h4>9. Skretth’s Chamber</h4>\n<p>Two @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.F1vAZZcmVKkRw8xn]{Clanrats} stand guard at the entrance. Unless the Characters arrive during the ritual (whose victim will be Klauss Dralst), @Actor[XviXu9z4RMAv0tmo]{Skretth} is here. Skretth’s mental state has deteriorated through his growing addiction to @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.5fowsr8vslorjeB2]{Mandrake} and the continued failure of his experiments. He spends more and more time here isolated from the rest of the group in ‘think-think time’. </p>\n<p>The only contents of the room, scattered haphazardly across the floor, are some foodstuffs, a shield, half a dozen unrefined Mandrake roots, and a small jar containing a dozen doses of Skretth’s Mandrake snuff. In addition, Skretth’s grimoire is here unless he is conducting the ritual.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><em>The Magic Ring</em></h3>\n<p><em>Somewhere in the course of his career, Skretth picked up a magical ring that casts the Necromancy spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.7BJDTRG65hwt1fUK]{Reanimate} with +6 SL. It has enough magical power to cast the spell twice: if he has no other choice, Skretth uses the ring to animate the corpses in area 12, turning them into @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies}.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>10. Robing Chamber</h4>\n<p>Skretth uses this room to prepare himself for the rituals. Two robes hang from pegs driven into the stone walls. One is black with a red lining: this is the robe Skretth uses when he performs his futile ritual. The other is white, torn, and bloodstained. Victims are dressed in this just prior to the ceremony. A sacrificial dagger lays on a natural shelf on the stone wall unless the ceremony is under way.</p>\n<h4>11. End of the Tunnel</h4>\n<p>The tunnel ends at this point, dropping away to the sewer some 7 yards below. A rope bridge spans the chasm, ending in another tunnel mouth that leads away into the darkness. A rough staircase is carved into the rock on the southern side of the gap, allowing the Skaven access to the sewer system by their own route — they prefer to avoid contact with the Humans whenever they can.</p>\n<h4>12. The Sacrificial Chamber</h4>\n<p>This huge, natural cavern is dominated by a carving of the Horned Rat on the northern wall. At the north end of the cavern is a bloodstained granite block with an iron ring set into it. The south end is bare except for two pillars supporting the entrance to the tunnel. This is where the Skaven assemble to attend the ritual. A torch in a wall bracket provides illumination: the light cast is sufficient for Skaven eyes, but Characters without @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.x0WMGwuQzReXcQrs]{Night Vision} or a light source of their own can only see dimly.</p>\n<p>All the Skaven attend the rituals, by Skretth’s command. When everyone is assembled, Skretth stands at the head of the block and leads the group in a chant: a noise so loud it can be heard as far away as area 3. This lasts for about a minute, increasing in volume and speed until the Skaven are worked up into a frenzy. The Skaven kill the victims at this point, then they fall silent, waiting for something (they are not sure what) to happen.</p>\n<p>Nothing happens. After a moment of uncomfortable silence, the body is dragged away into a corner. The six most recent victims lie here.</p>\n<p>If the adventurers reach the chamber before the ritual begins at midnight, Klauss is bound to the iron ring, a rope around his wrists, dressed only in the white robe from area 10 and too exhausted to cry for help. He is unguarded.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have to interrupt the ritual to save Klauss, the odds are against them. There may be up to a dozen Skaven in the cavern (all @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.F1vAZZcmVKkRw8xn]{Clanrats}, though you may wish to add a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.kl4qHg0mqWOApBqH]{Stormvermin} or two if you feel the Characters need an additional challenge), and these may be enough to overpower the Characters. If the party also has to deal with six @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies} raised using Skretth’s magic ring, they could be in trouble. Unless…</p>\n<p>Remember those bombs in the house? They might be enough to even the odds in a fight, or they might bring the cavern down on everyone’s head. Sensible Players should be able to use them to cover the Characters’ retreat if they find themselves outclassed.</p>\n<h2>CAPTURED!</h2>\n<p>If the Skaven capture the Characters, they are stripped of their possessions (which are placed in the westernmost cell of area 6) and tossed into different cells until Skretth is ready to use them in a future ritual. They can shout to one another from their cells, and the Players may use this opportunity to discuss wild and unlikely escape plans. However, as the jailer is exceptionally dim-witted, all they have to do is think up a remotely convincing story, succeeding at an <strong>Easy (+40) Charm</strong> Test, and @Actor[sRBnbhLgu3bBM3cq]{Tigrati}, the jailer, simply opens a door. A well-placed kick and a swift grab for the key could leave him in the cell, and a Character outside with the keys.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/yellow-fang-cultist.webp","folder":"k5awwFCu3Hu4rO1g","sort":325000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Ritual","sort":325000}}}

He attends some of the more cultural Carnival events, but is attended by an escort of half a dozen Teutogen Guards: elite warriors of Ulric drawn from within the Knights of the White Wolf. While the Guards are worried about possible threats to Ar-Ulric from fanatical followers of Sigmar or agents of a treacherous Emperor, the high priest himself is reduced to an almost paranoid state by the threat of blackmail that hangs over him, and the Graf ’s paramour, @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emannuelle Schlagen}. He is suspicious, if not downright terrified, of any stranger who approaches him in public. He is heavily guarded in private.</p>\n<p>While it is possible to engineer a situation in which the Characters can rescue Ar-Ulric from some threat, the Characters are more likely to find themselves flung out of the way by his bodyguard, who handles the situation with brutal efficiency. Any Characters who resist being flung aside find themselves treated as additional threats rather than helpful members of the public.</p>\n<p>The best, and perhaps the only, way to meet with Ar-Ulric on favourable terms is to be introduced by someone he trusts, preferably with a recommendation from @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle}. While the two cannot be too public in their meetings, she can still give the Characters a token which Ar-Ulric recognises, and that reassures him that she trusts the party. Preoccupied as he is with the threat of blackmail, he must be reassured that the Characters can help with this —or, better still, have already neutralised the blackmailer — before he can give his full attention to any stories of plots against the city or threats to the Graf ’s life.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Ar-Ulric can provide relatively few introductions, and will have to trust the Characters implicitly before he does so. The ‘Princess’ and her chaperone would respond well to a letter of introduction furnished by the high priest, and so would any of the @JournalEntry[9QmzxmgtDbdsPiSv]{Midden Marshals}.

While a noteworthy performance in a combat event is a good thing, a Character that impresses the Marshals far more by noting aloud that single combat has very little to do with the tasks of keeping order, or defending the city, or fighting as part of a military unit; those who can discuss such matters intelligently, and demonstrate some relevant experience, fare much better than those who cannot.</p>\n<p>The Characters can impress @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} by helping restore order when an anti-tax riot threatens to break out; if they conclude the scheduled event @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{‘Chaos Strikes by Night’} successfully, they get to meet Schutzmann.

First, the grass is cut, the bushes are trimmed, and all is made perfect in the garden itself. Then, the Graf ’s pavilion, the stage, and other structures are erected.

As he enters his pavilion his electoral flag is raised to indicate his presence. Breugal takes up his station by the Graf ’s right shoulder, and indicates with a nod that guests may enter.</p>\n<p>For the next two hours or so, the guests file past the Graf ’s pavilion, offering a bow or curtsey and receiving a distracted nod of acknowledgement.

They bow formally to the Graf, but with a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test, any Character can tell that beneath their impassive faces and impressive beards they are deeply unhappy. A Dwarf Character does not require a Test to see this. Prominent among them is an old Dwarf with a fine, long white beard and a terrible squint.

Meanwhile, Rallane and his friends greet the Graf, and Rallane mounts the stage to give an impromptu performance on the lute. A crowd gathers round to hear him play, while the Dwarf delegation stands to one side, glaring at the Elf whom many blame for the introduction of the Dwarf Tax. Yarnad Magradril makes a comment before Rallane’s second tune<em>. ‘Sweet enough for warbling I suppose, but if the Chancellor taxed you by the note he’d fill his coffers without having to bother them that does proper work’.  </em></p>\n<p>There is an awkward silence, and if a Character thinks of something suitably mollifying to say, they may well earn some gratitude from all in attendance (alternatively if they exacerbate matters, they earn people’s disapproval). Rallane plays for about fifteen minutes before leaving the stage to stroll about the party, chatting with friends, visiting the other entertainers, and playing from time to time.</p>\n<p>@Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} emerges from the palace, in the company of a pudgy man in his fifties. Richly dressed in Marienburger fashion, her companion seems both fascinated by her company and determined to talk her ear off. She smiles politely and puts in a word or phrase where she can, but her increasing annoyance is clear to anyone who makes an <strong>Easy (+40) Intuition</strong> Test. Characters who have previously made her acquaintance may try to rescue her from her tedious guest, gaining her gratitude if they do so without causing an incident.

A group of visiting merchants from Altdorf gravitates toward him, discussing the current religious tensions and asking him about recent rumours of anti-Sigmarite atrocities in Middenheim and across Middenland. He answers as best he can, but seems uncomfortable. As the conversation goes on, nearby partygoers quietly move away, leaving the Sigmarites alone and clearly isolated from the rest of the crowd. It is a subtle gesture, but definite, and Characters who pay attention notice that neither the priests nor the merchants have much to do with the other guests for the rest of the party. The Characters can join in the conversation if they wish; fellow Reiklanders are welcomed into the group, at the cost of being increasingly shunned by the surrounding Middenheimers.

Seconds later, @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} struggles through the crowd in pursuit of him, giving up after a few dozen paces.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi} and @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane}, who have both wanted to get to know one another a little better, take a stroll through the hedge maze.</p>\n<p>High Wizard @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Holseher} arrives, accompanied by his deputy @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} and her sister @Actor[ThOmnHA3l1Slh78K]{Erina}. All three are in the formal robes of their respective orders. Holseher bows stiffly to the Graf, who barely acknowledges him; he steps forward and opens his mouth to speak, but is stopped by a look from Breugal. Janna, meanwhile, scans the crowd. She sees Petra appearing from the hedge maze and gives her a friendly wave. Helseher wanders off and leaves them, as Janna points out major NPCs to her sister. If the Characters have already made Erina’s acquaintance at the @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{Templar’s Arms}, this is their opportunity to be introduced to Janna. Her reaction to them is modified by the impression they have already made on her sister.</p>\n<p>@Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich} arrives accompanying Sergei Bukharin, ambassador to the Empire from Tsar Radii Bokha of Kislev. He wears his hair and moustaches in long braids threaded with ceramic beads and he radiates strength. Despite the splendour all around, he can hardly take his eyes off Natasha, who reminds him of an old lover. She smiles and responds with seeming affection, but a <strong>Hard (–20) Intuition</strong> Test leads any Character to conclude that her manner is feigned. </p>\n<p>Those close enough to overhear gather that they have just come from the @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur fights} at the @JournalEntry[eM2ZiVNgS7dzI2bA]{Bernabau Stadium}, and the visitor is part of a Kislevite diplomatic mission that arrived shortly before Carnival week began.</p>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} arrives and bows to the Graf, treating him to an oily and ingratiating smile. The Graf nods without even looking up, and Gotthard stifles a scowl as he turns on his heel, snatches a drink from a passing tray, and stalks off into the crowd.</p>\n<p>Convenor Yarnad Magradil spots Gotthard and wades through the crowd toward him with grim determination. The Dwarf tries to corner Gotthard on the subject of the new taxes. Gotthard makes excuses about none of them being his idea (unconvincing, for the chair of the @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission on Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, but true nonetheless) and tries to persuade Yarnad to take the matter up with the Law Lords. If the Characters are interested in making Gotthard’s acquaintance (whether or not they already know that he is actually Gotthard von Wittgenstein), this is an opportunity for them to step in and smooth things over. </p>\n<p>This is not easy, though, as Yarnad is outraged and insulted and knows that his community is looking to him to take action.</p>\n<p>A cheer goes up from the entrance to the garden as @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} arrives, lofting the archery trophy in triumph — or, if he has failed to maintain his winning streak, carrying the victor on his shoulders. If one of the Characters won the tournament, the whole party is with the huntmaster as his guests. Anyone close to @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} who passes a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test notices her look over to the source of the cheer, like most other guests, and then turns away quickly, with a slight blush on her cheeks. Meanwhile, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel} and @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} greet each other with a wave and a shout in Elthárin, gesturing to a nearby drinks table where they and their companions meet up with much cheering and back-slapping.</p>\n<p>@Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich} and Sergei Bukharin take their turn to find their way through the hedge maze.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi} is not a wholly malign man, but when bored he does indulge in an appetite for high jinks. Having found the punch rather tame, he doctors it with extract of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.b6tGqvNe1jYBdeN5]{Weirdroot}. Anyone drinking a glass from this point forward should make an <strong>Average (+20) Toughness</strong> Test, or suffer the effects of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.b6tGqvNe1jYBdeN5]{Weirdroot}. Characters passing a <strong>Very Hard (–30) Perception</strong> Test spot the Doktor producing a small vial and preparing to empty it into the punch bowl. They could let him know they have their eye on him, in which case their discretion wins them his friendship. Alternatively, they could inform the authorities. This would end the Physician’s career in Middenheim, but wins the Characters the high regard of @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Chaperone Zimperlich}. If Bettie Greenhill is informed she provides a fresh bowl of punch, and can scold Luigi without costing him his position at court.</p>\n<h3>6:00–7:00 P.M.</h3>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} arrive together, with her two sisters Ulrike and Bertha. The sisters may have shared a coach with the Characters on the journey from Altdorf (as well as the early part of the adventure @JournalEntry[u0jibG3CVNoLK6GT]{Flying Death Skulls}, and this is an opportunity to renew the acquaintance and possibly to be introduced to Kirsten and Dieter as gallant travelling companions. Depending on the events of the journey, the Characters can gain an initial bonus to Fellowship Tests when dealing with Dieter and Kirsten, up to a maximum of +30. Those who did not endear themselves to the sisters are not granted an introduction: their subsequent dealings with Dieter or Kirsten suffer a penalty of up to –20, and if they persist in bothering the group, Dieter sees them off.</p>\n<p>A scuffle breaks out between children at the rabbit hutch, and a pair of rabbits escape and hop into the hedge maze.</p>\n<p>The rather infirm Baroness Marlena Klochmann presses on @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} to help her find her way through the hedge maze. Siegfried condescends to help the Baroness. Anyone who passes a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test notices that he is more relieved at the invitation than she is by his agreeing to it, after all no one else was paying him any attention.</p>\n<p>Another flourish of trumpets announces the arrival of @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’ Katarina}, who comes out of the palace accompanied by her chaperone @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} and lady at court @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}. The little group curtseys to the Graf, who looks up and smiles wanly. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test allows a Character to notice the pride in his eyes as he looks at his daughter, and a hint of something else — perhaps an attempt to rally himself ? — when he acknowledges Emmanuelle.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE WINE OF MADNESS</em></h3>\n<p><em>If you intend to make use of the short adventure '@JournalEntry[eZNUTrVGtnRXtKUx]{The Wine of Madness}', you may wish to lay the groundwork for that adventure now. @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard} has taken a little of the Estalian Mosca with him to sample at the garden party, or perhaps to taint the drinks or food that can be had there. Characters who pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test will spot Wallenstein drop a small glass bottle from inside his waistcoat at around 5:45 pm, before quickly recovering it and glancing about to see if anyone noticed him. There are too many present for him to spot the Characters unless they draw attention to themselves. Those who passed the Perception Test by at least +2 SL notice that @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}, fresh from his own much milder enhancement of the punch, got a good look at the bottle Gottard dropped and seems quite amused...</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Almost as soon as the ‘princess’ turns away from her father, a tidal wave of handsome young gallants surrounds the three women. Hildegarde and Emmanuelle stand by Katarina’s side, doing their best to deflect as many as they can, but Katarina herself hardly seems to notice. She politely offers distant responses to the deluge of compliments and attempts to grab her attention.</p>\n<p>Bettie Greenhill enters the hedge maze to search for the stray rabbits.</p>\n<p>After making a circuit of the party, High Wizard @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher} returns to the Graf ’s pavilion. Anyone passing a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test sees him start to say something before Breugal steps forward and raises a warning hand. Shooting a venomous glance at @Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal}, he bows and takes his leave. He had tried to talk to the Graf about the taxes, but the chamberlain did not want his master bothered.</p>\n<p>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} is working up the nerve to talk to @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}. Anyone passing a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test notices her watching him intently for a while. She does not approve of his wild manner of carousing. After a while she approaches him. He immediately settles down, and stands respectfully. She then thanks him effusively for the generous donations he has made to the Shallyan institutions in Middenheim. He smiles an unctuous smile and tells her that it was his most humble pleasure.</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} emerges from the hedge maze. Spotting the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’} he rather ungraciously leaves Baroness Marlene and joins the throng of young men surrounding Katarina. He is roundly ignored by everyone, and after a while he leaves to mingle once more. He spots @Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{von Genscher} eating a pastry nearby, and starts toward him with a hopeful expression; the Marshal, however, spots Siegfried from the corner of his eye and moves quickly away, striking up a conversation with Sergei Bukharin about the logistics of supplying a field army in the cold boreal forests of the Troll Country. Anyone passing an <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test notices Siegfried grimace and shrink visibly. He shuffles dejectedly to the pavilion, bows to the Graf and takes his leave.</p>\n<p>Having mingled for a while, @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten}, Ulrike, and Bertha sit down with @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} and @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel} and share a few drinks. Having made their introductions, Bertha and Ulrike navigate the hedge maze, during which they encounter Bettie Greenhill still looking for the rabbits.</p>\n<p>Shortly before 7:00, guests begin to drift away, heading for the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music} and the opera <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessile}</em>. These include @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}, surrounded by a boisterous group of friends, and @Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Marshal von Genscher}, walking purposefully but alone. Baroness Marlena Klochmann, who knows not to push her luck, also vanishes at this point.</p>\n<h3>7:00–8:00 P.M.</h3>\n<p>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} arrives with a small party of three priests and two Knights of the White Wolf. He bows to the Graf; the White Wolves suppress scowls at the scant nod he receives in return. Ar-Ulric speaks briefly to his companions; the priests nod and head off toward a nearby drinks table, but the White Wolves shake their heads. After holding their impassive gaze for a few seconds, Ar-Ulric snorts in frustration and heads off into the crowd, the two knights matching his stride.</p>\n<p>Characters close to @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} may make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test to notice that she and Ar-Ulric exchange a glance. It is clearly meaningful, but hard to interpret: an Impressive or better success will lead to the conclusion that they are romantically involved, and hoped to meet at the party before the High Priest’s bodyguard thwarted them.</p>\n<p>@Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} and @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} take a wander through the hedge maze.</p>\n<p>Bettie Greenhill leaves the hedge maze having captured the errant rabbits.</p>\n<p>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} has spotted @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}. Anyone passing a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test notices her try to catch his eye before looking saddened and frustrated. She leaves the party.</p>\n<p>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel} expresses a desire to take in the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}. He is joined by @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, who says goodnight to @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten} and her sisters, leaving them in the company of the Eberhauer sisters.</p>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard} notices Dieter has left. He sits down next to Bertha Jung, yawns theatrically, and tries to put his arm around her shoulder. She recoils violently and slaps him.</p>\n<p>The shifting currents of people bring @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} and his two Knights of the White Wolf suddenly and unexpectedly face to face with High Priest Werner Stolz of the @JournalEntry[vAaGf9u5fHrlxSSs]{Temple of Sigmar} and his two initiates. There is an awkward pause before the two priests acknowledge each other with a nod; the initiates and the knights glare at each other, and a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test allows any Character to notice the knights’ knuckles whiten slightly as they grip the hafts of their great hammers. Then the two priests turn away from each other, and the groups go their separate ways.</p>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} leaves the party, accompanied by three or four junior merchants. The group of merchants leaves the palace complex and heads into one of the city’s less reputable districts in search of less refined company.</p>\n<h3>8:00 P.M.</h3>\n<p>Precisely at 8:00, a flourish of trumpets signals the end of the party. The Graf rises from his throne, acknowledging the bows and curtseys of the crowd with a vague wave of his hand, and returns to his private apartments in the palace. @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’ Katarina}, her chaperone @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde}, and the lady at court @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle} accompany him. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test allows any nearby Character to notice that the Graf casts an affectionate glance toward Emmanuelle, which she returns; on an Impressive or better success, though, her response may seem a little forced. Just as they leave the garden, Emmanuelle looks around, locking eyes briefly with @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} before the group enters the palace. Any Characters near Ar-Ulric may attempt a <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test to notice a look of mixed affection and pain cross his face. He heaves a visible sigh and walks quietly toward the exit, flanked by Knights of the White Wolf.</p>\n<p>Yarnad Magradil leaves promptly at 8:00; after all that was the time noted on his invitation.</p>\n<p>At a nod from @Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal}, the palace servants begin clearing away furniture and food as the musicians and other performers pack up and prepare to leave. Bettie Greenhill manages staff as they return crockery and cutlery to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>A group of guests leaves, including @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten} and her two sisters, and Jann@Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{a Eberhauer} and her sister @Actor[ThOmnHA3l1Slh78K]{Erina}. If a Character won the archery tournament earlier in the day, or befriended @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} or any of the Jung sisters, they may be invited to join the group as they head for one of the city’s classier hostelries — the @JournalEntry[uv75n0ftS1SPIHeA]{Laughing Jackass} — to spend the rest of the evening.</p>\n<p>@Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra} and @Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha} say goodnight to their charges and retire to their apartments in the palace to change. Thereafter Petra joins the group at the @JournalEntry[uv75n0ftS1SPIHeA]{Laughing Jackass} while Natasha heads for the @JournalEntry[jOgoeW03OTDSX2PP]{Harvest Goose}, where she meets the Kislevite ambassador again over a sumptuous meal. He is besotted with her, while she sees him as a useful source of influence outside Middenheim.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} is among the last to leave, taking a quick circuit of the garden, emptying any glasses and bottles that have not yet been cleared away. With a quick look to make sure @Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal} is out of sight, Luigi slips a half-emptied bottle of wine under his arm and heads to the @JournalEntry[UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{Great Park}, where the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales} is still in progress.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image\" style=\"justify-content:flex-end\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/garden-party-ulric.webp\" width=\"494\" height=\"367\" /></div>","img":null,"folder":"qPMzSDu7RKbTDzy7","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Graf's Garden Party","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"AK5GN83vbZLaX6V0","name":"Lesser Temples","content":"<p>No matter where Ulric’s temples are erected, almost all follow the same template: a square wall protecting a fortified inner sanctum. The outer walls are normally undecorated, although isolated temples proudly boast any scars of war they have sustained. A single, reinforced gatehouse pierces the defences, and often houses an array of anti-siege measures. A wolf ’s head emblem is carved above the gate: the only sign that the place is a temple and not a well-defended keep.</p>\n<p>Within, everything is austere, utilitarian, and grey. Functional temple buildings (including workshops, cells, barracks, refectories, stables, and animal pens) cling close to the high walls, overlooking wide courtyards and training squares. The temple itself rises in the centre, its manned battlements surrounding a high dome.</p>\n<p>The temple interior is usually a single, windowless chamber, lit only by small apertures in the dome above and by a great, central, ever-burning fire that represents the Eternal Flame in Middenheim. Opposite the entrance, and behind the sacred flame, is a raised sacristy. Here, a grim statue of Ulric, sometimes sitting, often flanked by wolves, silently challenges those who dare enter his sacred hall.</p>\n<h3>The Womb of The Wolf</h3>\n<p>The Womb of the Wolf is believed by the Sons to be the site where Ulric’s first mortal child was born. The mother, Griselda, was the daughter of the Teutogen chief, and fled into the tunnels of the Ulricsberg when she became pregnant. There, the Sons believe, she was brought meat by Ulric’s wolves, and drank water from a holy spring.</p>\n<p>There is still a spring there today, and the site where the birth supposedly happened is lined with wolf skins. See @JournalEntry[izJWeN4ivjqEleqK]{Womb of the Wolf} for more information.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[LsUklap1rbMtM7RO]{The Place of Shining Rock}</h3>\n<p>On the road from Altdorf to Middenheim, about fifty miles from the City of the White Wolf, there is a remote shrine known as the Place of Shining Rock.</p>\n<p>Unusually, it is sacred to both Ulric and Sigmar. It is said to be the site of a pleasant, wooded glade where one of the two gods (depending on the faith of whomever is telling the story) had come to rest after a battle against the forces of Chaos. Caught in an ambush with his weapon out of reach (or temporarily lost, according to some versions of the legend), the god picked up a strange rock as an improvised shield. An attacker’s blow miraculously shattered part of it into a long, sharp shard and, using it as a sword, the god slew five hundred enemies before they fled. A shrine was built around the rock, which lays where the god threw it down after the battle.</p>\n<p>The turning off the road to the shrine is marked by a large, white boulder. Half a mile down the track is an open area of flat, rocky ground, an acre or two in extent. In the middle stands a simple but elegant building about 40 feet long, with a low tower at one end. It looks more like a village temple than a shrine. At the edge of the clearing, by the river that marks one side of it and about 70 yards from the shrine itself, is another building: a single-storey wood-framed structure with a steep planked roof and a chimney. This one-room structure houses the four priests — two of Sigmar and two of Ulric — who attend the shrine.</p>\n<h3>The Shrine of the Wolf</h3>\n<p>On a country road ten miles north of Altdorf lies an obscure shrine: a small stone tower, not more than 10 feet square and four storeys high. It tapers as it rises, and ends in a tiled belfry. The bell is gone, however, and hasn’t been there for hundreds of years. On the ground floor is a wooden altar supporting a small, wooden statue of a wolf, and carved into the wall behind it is the simple legend: Sigmar and Ulric.</p>\n<p>According to local legends, the place commemorates the site where Sigmar was said to have met with Ulric in his wolven form. He fought the wolf to a standstill and, depending on which version of the story one believes, either Sigmar was impressed by the wolf ’s bravery and agreed to spare it, or the wolf was impressed by Sigmar and agreed to spare him. However, both versions of the story are obscure these days.</p>\n<p>Locals know the place only as the Shrine of the Wolf. It is little visited these days, and the inside is dusty and devoid of offerings. No priest attends it, and no pilgrims visit it. </p>\n<h3>The Drakwald College of the Holy Wolf</h3>\n<p>Poking through the shadowy canopy of the Drakwald Forest, far from the Middenheim–Altdorf road, is a steep rocky outcrop topped with a lonely-looking Ulrican temple. This is the Drakwald College of the Holy Wolf, a renowned Ulrican seminary famous for the devotion and piety of the priests it produces, and infamous for the brutal regime to which its initiates are subjected.</p>\n<p>Membership is reserved for those initiates of Middenheim and Middenland who show great promise, and only a dozen are enrolled in any year. Initiates are subjected to a gruelling routine, with frequent beatings, arbitrary punishments, and lengthy rituals. Of the dozen who enroll, less than half become priests, for many flee their harsh masters before ordination. Of course, because the college is deep in the dangerous Drakwald Forest, few who flee make it home alive.</p>\n<p>Many high priests of Ulric have come from the college, including Ar-Ulric Bronnstein, who famously died in battle fighting a Skaven raiding party on the steps of the high temple in Middenheim in 1116.</p>\n<h2>Other Sacred Sites</h2>\n<p>Ulrican holy sites are common across the north of the Empire, especially in Middenland and southern Nordland. Shrines to Ulric line the roads of the north, especially where wolves have their hunting grounds. The most common decorative motifs are a wolf ’s head and a stylised letter ‘U,’ and crude statues of the god are not uncommon. Shrines are tended by wandering priests of the Howling Wolf or by devout locals.</p>\n<p>Most Ulricans also maintain small shrines to Ulric in their homes or barracks. They normally feature a statue where ale can be poured (‘<em>First drink to Ulric!</em>’ being a common toast) beside which weapons are stacked to receive the god’s blessing. Almost every barracks in the Empire, even those in the far south, have such a shrine to Ulric.</p>","folder":"dwFMawMRwTARIXyO","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Cult of Ulric","sort":200000}}}
{"_id":"AZKZlDd542Pv90gj","name":"Parting Ways","content":"<p>At the @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.4l26HR2WUvQ6BAzT]{end of Death on the Reik}, the Characters had just arrived in Altdorf, having been hired to take a crate to Middenheim. There is a lot to tempt them in the vast and bustling capital, but they must hurry if they are to deliver their cargo on time and claim their payment.</p>\n<h2>Parting Ways</h2>\n<p>Depending on earlier events, the Characters will have at least some goodbyes to say.</p>\n<h3>THE BARGE</h3>\n<p>In ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.p6uoMs09lyIar8qc]{Carrion up the Reik}’, the final chapter of Death on the Reik, the GM was given a number of options — some harsh, others less so — to make sure that the Characters no longer own a river barge, and therefore are not tempted to ignore Middenheim and spend the rest of their lives going up and down the Reik as traders. If they still have their own barge at the start of this adventure, some of these options are worth restating.</p>\n<h4>The Law of the River</h4>\n<p>On approaching Altdorf, the River Patrol stops the Characters’ boat for a routine check. The Patrol identifies it as belonging to someone else: the next-of-kin of the boat’s previous owners (whom the Characters found dead aboard the drifting vessel after a mutant attack — see ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.xag3f0PzNfG8kdbw]{A Boat in Need’}) have reported the barge as lost. Since it is registered in Altdorf, the River Patrol there has been keeping an eye out for it.</p>\n<p>A cruel GM might face the Characters with accusations of murder and piracy, requiring them to prove that they found the boat drifting and came into possession of it through legal salvage: @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.JPH3aDjaHPMg9sps]{Josef Quartjin} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.wwwoy9PIIDOQZdF8]{Renate Hausier} testify to their innocence, if they can be found, or a Character  or NPC litigant might need to prove their innocence before a magistrate, which requires extended Tests against Lore (Law), Entertain (Speeches), and/or any other Skill that the GM deems relevant.</p>\n<p>A kinder, and quicker, option is to assume that the River Patrol accepts the Characters’ story grants, according to the custom of the river, that any cargo and profits from their operating the boat is theirs by right of salvage; and insists only that the vessel be handed over to the lawful heirs of its deceased owner.</p>\n<h4>A Friend in Need</h4>\n<p>The Characters’ old friend and mentor, @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.JPH3aDjaHPMg9sps]{Josef Quartjin}, is often to be found in Altdorf. So they are not surprised to encounter him in a dockside tavern. This time, though, he is down on his luck: his beloved barge, the <em>Berebeli</em>, was destroyed in a recent mishap — by mutants or river pirates, or in a collision with another vessel ‘crewed by idiots,’ as Josef says.</p>\n<p>Unless he can find another boat, Josef must either sign on as crew with another owner — an almost unbearable humiliation for a boatman of his vast experience — or sit on the docks and watch his little remaining cash run out. On hearing that the Characters are thinking of going to Middenheim, Josef leaps at the chance to take over their barge for them, promising to keep it well maintained and split any profits with them when they return.</p>\n<h4>The Unexpected</h4>\n<p>If the Characters saved their barge from a fiery end in ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.p6uoMs09lyIar8qc]{Carrion up the Reik}’ they may not be expecting the arsonist to strike again — but perhaps they are mistaken. Their client @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.FTT9hoFswIqAW9do]{Matthias Blucher} has the vessel burned in Altdorf, as soon as their backs are turned.</p>\n<p>If they were still carrying a cargo bound for Marienburg, it is gone, with no clause in their contract saying that the Blucher family will pay for repairs. However, Blucher agents in the capital offer them the lower-paying commission of taking a large crate to Captain Scharlach in Middenheim (see ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.OabDbKp86QR7Ib1Z]{Misfortune Managed}’) if they have not already signed up for the job.</p>\n<h4>In the Market</h4>\n<p>Alternatively, the Characters might decide to sell the barge — which is, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.g796u6AgEQvRPlp7]{in theory at least}, worth 225 GC. Of course, selling a barge is not as simple as taking a bag of money and walking away from the wharf: there is paperwork to be completed in order to transfer ownership and update official registers, and there is the question of the vessel’s age and condition, the number of other vessels on the market locally, and the number of people looking to buy.</p>\n<p>Unless the Characters intend to stay in Altdorf for at least a week — and miss the delivery date for their Middenheim package — they would be well advised to place the matter in the hands of an intermediary. Altdorf and other large river ports are home to a specialised class of merchants who will handle all the details of buying or selling a vessel in exchange for 10% of the purchase price. It should be noted that another 5% is swallowed up by documentation fees, wharfage, taxes, and other expenses.</p>\n<h4>Just Keep the Blasted Thing!</h4>\n<p>Some players might make a game of holding on to the barge despite everything you try in order to deprive them of it, and are very unlikely to let it go just because the Characters have been hired to go to Middenheim. Unless they do something outlandish, like fitting the boat with wheels and sailing it up the highway, they have to leave it in Altdorf and make some provision for its care and safety until they return to reclaim it. </p>\n<p>If this is the only way to get the Characters on the road to Middenheim, then by all means indulge them. While there are storage and maintenance fees to consider, try to keep these low so that the Characters are not unduly rushed into returning from Middenheim before they have a chance to engage with the plot of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. A few silver per week is more than sufficient. If you happen to own the <strong>Death on the Reik Companion</strong>, remind your players that some time in an Altdorf dry dock might be an excellent opportunity to apply some upgrades to their beloved barge. If you intend to continue into <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, then in all likelihood it will be some time before the opportunity again arises for them to return to the vessel.</p>\n<p>And if you really must, they can always return to find the entire dry dock ablaze. Thankfully, Altdorf is never short of an arsonist or two, should the need arise!</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/alex-eisen.webp\" width=\"177\" height=\"205\" /></div>\n<h3>Alex Goes To Middenheim</h3>\n<p>If the Characters came to Altdorf aboard the Blue Salmon, they part ways with @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.Pa77IT9maJR1nU7M]{Alex Eisen} and his crew. </p>\n<p>Alex is enthusiastic about going to Middenheim for the Carnival.<em> ‘Wouldn’t miss it,’</em> he says, in his usual blunt and bigoted fashion. <em>‘Those northerners are a po-faced shower every other time of year, but get a few brandies into one of them at Carnival, and watch out!

{"_id":"AeQQYBQJpCSlhk9w","name":"Followers of Ulric","content":"<blockquote>\n<p>Ulric give me the fangs of the wolf,</p>\n<p>Ulric give me the claws of the wolf,</p>\n<p>Ulric give me the coat of the wolf,</p>\n<p>And I will show your enemies the mercy of the wolf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As noted on @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.LQ2w4wBqLqxjQxsh]{The Cult of Ulric, God of War}, the cult of Ulric consists of two main orders: the priestly Howling Wolves and the martial White Wolves. Within each order, there are opportunities for devout Characters to follow a number of different careers. A few of them are outlined below, including details on how they differ from the Career descriptions in the WFRP rulebook.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>TERMS OF ADDRESS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Ulrican Priests, Monks, Nuns, and Warrior Priests in the second or third Career level are addressed as ‘Wolf-born,’ or referred to as ‘the Wolf-born [name].’ Characters in the fourth level of their Career claim the title ‘Lord Wolf’.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Priests of the Howling Wolf</h3>\n<p>Not all members of the Order of the Howling Wolf are ordained Priests. It takes people from all walks of life to maintain the temples and other facilities that provide for the faithful of Ulric, and lay members of the order can be following many different Careers.</p>\n<h4>Monks and Nuns</h4>\n<p>While monasteries devoted to the worship of Ulric are not as well-known as those of Sigmar, they are not unheard of. They fall into two broad categories: contemplative and ascetic.</p>\n<h4>Contemplative Monasteries</h4>\n<p>The best-known monastery of this type is the Lore Haus, housed in a wing of Middenheim’s great @JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{Temple of Ulric}. This is the Old World’s greatest repository of Ulrican theology and history, where monks and nuns study ancient scriptures dating back as far as Teutogen times.</p>\n<p>Characters of this type are very similar to the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.bE8g67fjVAE6R7Wx]{Monks and Nuns}, except that their Trade and Lore Skills focus on history (especially that of Middenland, Nordland, Kislev, Norsca, and the ancient Teutogens) and the creation and repair of books and scrolls (printing, bookbinding, etc.). The more senior staff often have some experience as a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.cIBJfaY9DKJh5ZEM]{Scholar}.</p>\n<p>The Lore Haus is also the final authority on the canon law of the cult of Ulric, and its staff includes a few Monks and Nuns who also have levels in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.GhqPa2iwEdc4Dokc]{Lawyer} Career .</p>\n<p>While devoted to their studies, the contemplatives of the Haus do not neglect the Ulrican tradition of keeping themselves fit and trained for combat at all times (many Nuns and Monks of the Lore Haus choose to take Advances in a favoured Melee Skill during their second Career level). From time to time, a few set forth on an expedition to seek out some location from Ulrican legend or a cache of historical or religious documents.</p>\n<h4>Ascetic Monasteries</h4>\n<p>These are smaller and more numerous than their contemplative counterparts. Some fall under the monastic Order of the Winter Throne, but many more are independent. Dedicated to hardening the body and soul through exposure to the elements, physical exertion, and combat training, most of these monasteries are located in remote and barren places such as mountaintops and deep valleys. Some are little more than a collection of small caves in which members of the community sleep, while a few consist of a cluster of rough, hand-built stone huts surrounded by a wall.</p>\n<p>The ascetic Monks and Nuns of Ulric live as close to the wild as they can, hunting their own food as wolves would do. They usually have at least one level in a Warrior or Ranger Career in addition to their religious pursuits, and many are (or become) @JournalEntry[GkT1arSV9rYhYvrG]{Wolf-Kin}, the fanatical warriors whom many compare to the crazed flagellants of Sigmar. See <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</strong> for more on these rugged worshippers of Ulric.</p>\n<h3>The Knights of the White Wolf</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘It is in war that we glorify our gods, for what greater cause is there than to fight and die in the name of Ulric?’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">—<em>Frandegast Ulfheim, Knight of the White Wolf</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Knights of the White Wolf are an order of templars who protect the @JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{Temple of Ulric} and serve Ar-Ulric both in his capacity as High Priest and Elector. They are the oldest and the largest templar order in the Old World, their founding dating back over 2,000 years to the time of Ar-Ulric Wulcan.</p>\n<p>Although they are based in Middenheim, the White Wolves serve Ar-Ulric rather than the Graf. This has been known to cause tensions in the past, but throughout history the holders of Middenheim’s two great offices have taken pains to work together, and Knights of the White Wolf have taken the field alongside Middenheim’s army on many occasions. Almost every temple of Ulric, from the smallest of shrines to the high temple in Middenheim, has at least one or two White Wolves stationed in it.</p>\n<p>White Wolves are tasked with guarding the temples and priests of Ulric throughout the Empire and beyond. Units of White Wolves may be dispatched on quests or missions, or they may be sent to battle, marching as part of the army of Middenland to war, or accompanying a larger templar army on the battlefield. </p>\n<h4>Equipment</h4>\n<p>The Knights of the White Wolf are distinctive, both on and off the battlefield. When on duty or in battle, White Wolves dress in heavy suits of plate mail, lacquered black or treated with dark oils. Every knight wears a distinctive wolf pelt over his shoulders, and it is a rite of passage that every White Wolf must hunt, kill, and skin a wolf with their bare hands in order to become a full-fledged member of the order.</p>\n<p>White Wolves fight from the back of red-barded warhorses, wielding cavalry hammers instead of lances. They refuse to wear helmets, and their flowing hair and long beards add to the ferocity of their appearance on the battlefield.</p>\n<h4>Careers</h4>\n<p>All Knights of the White Wolf have at least one level in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.n2VdkCPNNxdupjeQ]{Knight} Caree, and some are also @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.KG5lVereynSwOkxa]{Warrior Priests}. Their Skills, Talents, and Trappings are as shown for those Careers, modified as necessary to reflect their ability to use a two-handed warhammer from the saddle and their refusal to wear helmets, which they consider cowardly. Most Knights have previous Careers as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.kT0ZI0LoHmIvhjPk]{Soldiers} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.h9LHCAdlP4o55QvD]{Cavalry}.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wolf-claw-amulet.webp\" width=\"189\" height=\"204\" /></div>\n<h3>The Teutogen Guard</h3>\n<p>The Teutogen Guard is an elite unit within the Knights of the White Wolf, and forms Ar-Ulric’s personal bodyguard. They normally fight on foot, but are armed and armoured identically to the other knights of their order.</p>\n<h4>The Brotherhood of the Axe</h4>\n<p>Although they are now technically subordinate to the Teutogen Guard, the Brotherhood’s origins go back to the days before Sigmar, when the Teutogens were the most powerful tribe in what is now the northern part of the Empire. They were an elite warrior society made up of the very finest Teutogen warriors, the bodyguards of the ancient Teutogen warrior-kings, whose names are still enshrined in song and story. When Sigmar united the tribes and founded the Empire, the Brotherhood of the Axe retained their original role as protectors of the Teutogen chiefs.</p>\n<p>Only warriors of pure Teutogen blood are admitted to the Brotherhood, and they must also be warriors of proven skill and unquestioning loyalty to Ulric. They are fiercely traditional (some would call them reactionary) and see themselves as the only true guardians of the old warrior traditions. They arm themselves with great two-handed axes rather than hammers, arguing that the traditional Teutogen war-axe is the weapon of Ulric while the hammer is that of Sigmar.</p>\n<p>Most of the Brotherhood are anti-Sigmarite, and because of this the order is regarded with some suspicion by the Imperial authorities. However, their prowess on the battlefield is unquestioned, and they are widely admired in Middenheim.</p>\n<h3>Lay Personnel</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>ULRICAN SAYINGS</em></h3>\n<p>‘The baying you hear be not mere curs.’ <em>— A grave threat is approaching.</em></p>\n<p>‘The cold fire reveals all.’ <em>— A warning to speak the truth.</em></p>\n<p>‘The word of a Sigmarite.’<em> — A falsehood.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both the monastic and martial orders of the cult of Ulric employ large numbers of lay personnel: devout followers of the god who are not ordained as priests or inducted as knights.</p>\n<p>The temples, and the more contemplative monasteries, employ large staffs of servants, artisans, and other individuals who see to the mundane tasks of construction, repair, maintenance, and day-to-day running. In addition, Ulricans of all types sometimes retire to a monastery for a short time, either in repayment of a vow or to spend some time reconnecting with their faith for other, more personal reasons.</p>\n<p>While inducted Knights of the White Wolf form the core of the Electoral force commanded by Ar-Ulric, they are accompanied in the field by lay infantry and cavalry who are sworn to serve the cult. In peacetime, some serve the temples and monasteries as guards, hunters, groundskeepers, and manual labourers, while others are small units drawn from a particular village or group of farms, training together as part of their devotion to the wolf-god. They usually have one or two levels in a Warrior or Ranger Career, and are led by a Priest or Warrior Priest in their second or third Career level.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE CHILDREN OF ULRIC</em></h3>\n<p><em>Some Ulricans believe that Werewolves are especially favoured by Ulric, who grants them the ability to walk abroad as Human or wolf. Werewolves are sometimes called ‘children of Ulric,’ but they should not be confused with @JournalEntry[GkT1arSV9rYhYvrG]{Wolf-Kin}, nor yet with ‘children of Ulric’ as a term for wolves in general.

{"_id":"B4GNmzNvssniSqYr","name":"The Sigmarite Heresy","content":"<p>The so-called ‘Sigmarite Heresy’ is at the centre of the growing religious tensions between north and south, which threaten to tear the Empire apart. In essence, it is a simple theological difference, but it has come to stand for a number of long-standing resentments and cultural differences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Heed me. It will snow in the Reikland once more, and through the snow, the wolves will hunt.’?’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>–Olaf Eichhorn, Priest of Ulric</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For centuries, the leaders of the cults of Ulric and Sigmar have smoothed over their religious differences in the interests of unity, and only fringe fanatics and hard-line separatists have raised the subject. Since no one took these groups very seriously, the Sigmarite Heresy became more and more of a non-issue, a mere theological curiosity that was, in most people’s view, as ridiculous as the people who argued for its significance. In recent months, though, that has changed — but no one is quite sure how or why.</p>\n<p>In its simplest form, the Sigmarite Heresy proposes that Sigmar is at best an inferior deity to Ulric (some say, a mere demigod who serves Ulric as a shield-bearer) and at worst that he is not a god at all: just the revered memory of a great — but mortal — chieftain. The underlying theology is complex in the extreme, depending on the deep study of ancient legends and chronicles from many sources — not all of them Human — and the very subjective interpretation of key words and phrases in multiple ancient languages.</p>\n<p>The central argument is that since it was the High Priest of Ulric who crowned Sigmar as the first Emperor, the cult of Ulric is the pre-eminent faith of the Empire by right and tradition: every claim made on behalf of Sigmar by his followers, from Emperor to god, derives from the authority of Ulric and his priesthood. Certain extreme positions argue from this basis, and from the fact that no Ulrican source describes Sigmar as a god until well after the Sigmarite Emperors established the power of Altdorf over the whole Empire — Ulric himself never pronounced Sigmar a god. Therefore, Sigmar’s deification was simply a decree made by mortal Emperors, and carries no weight with the gods themselves.</p>\n<p>This issue has come to stand for every grievance that the Ulrican north holds against the Sigmarite south. There are many of these, ranging from resentment of Imperial authority to the foppish snobbery that many northerners perceive (not without justification in many cases) in the actions and manners of visiting Altdorfers. Thanks to the machinations of the Purple Hand, popular sentiment in Middenheim and across the north has been stirred up against the south in general and Altdorf in particular. Aspirations of independence as a separate and completely Ulrican nation have been stoked to the point where violence is starting to break out on both sides of the divide.</p>\n<p>An even more extreme view is currently dismissed by all but the most fanatically unhinged. If Sigmar is not a legitimate god, not recognised by Ulric and the other traditional deities of the Old World, and yet he behaves like a god, granting Miracles and Blessings to his followers, then only one conclusion is possible: that he is really a Chaos God, either a mask worn by one of the four known Ruinous Powers or a separate malign entity. Needless to say, the cult of Sigmar spares neither flame nor sword in its efforts to suppress this proposition.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{The Sons of Ulric}</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<p>‘My friends, let me explain what I mean:</p>\n<p>Sigmar was an Ulrican.</p>\n<p>Sigmar founded this Empire. Thus, the Empire is Ulric’s nation.</p>\n<p>We are all Ulricans! This slavish devotion to Sigmar must end!’’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>—Johann von Schattenlas, Carroburg Politician</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Sons of Ulric were originally an extreme and widely outlawed sect of the cult, whose members claimed to be the blood descendants of Ulric himself and believed that only they were worthy to be his priests. Some Sons of Ulric actively persecuted those who they deemed not to be of pure, unadulterated Teutogen blood, and all were implacably opposed to the growing power of the southern interloper Sigmar and his priests.</p>\n<p>A fractious and disorganised movement, the Sons were constantly splintering into smaller groups following one charismatic leader or another, unable to agree whose blood was the purest and who should lead them. Infighting between groups sometimes became a threat to public order, and the splinter groups visited even greater atrocities upon each other than they did on non-believers, the lax in faith, or the followers of Sigmar. While capable of causing great trouble, they were simply too fragmented to constitute a serious threat, and the authorities did little to stamp them out.</p>\n<p>As the Sigmarite Heresy has reared its ugly head over recent months and north-south tensions — religious and otherwise — have grown to their present dangerous pitch, the Sons of Ulric have become more active, and apparently more organised. Atrocities against the Sigmarite minority in Middenland, Nordland, and surrounding areas, and attacks on coaches and merchant caravans travelling north from Altdorf, have increased in both number and severity, to the point where the Grand Theogonist has called an emergency congress of Sigmarite priests and scholars to discuss the Sigmarite Heresy and seek some permanent compromise to restore peace — the Characters may have heard of this on their travels.</p>\n<p>At this time it is unclear whether the Sons of Ulric are really behind the escalating violence, or whether their name has been co-opted by other groups of religious fanatics, northern separatists, and opportunistic bandits. What is beyond doubt, though, is that their name has never been more prominent, or more widely feared.</p>","folder":"dwFMawMRwTARIXyO","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Cult of Ulric","sort":500000}}}

He supports the taxes, and many people believe they were his idea. Most see him as a distant and uncaring bureaucrat.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}</h3>\n<p>The Graf ’s champion, little seen except when he issues his challenge to all comers at the Carnival (see @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Carnival Events: Square of Martials}), although he can sometimes be found out drinking with @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} in the city’s better establishments. A lowborn individual who has won renown and position, he is popular in the city — especially since the news broke of his engagement to Kirsten Jung, one of the ladies of the Graf ’s court. He has to retire from his post as the Graf ’s champion in order to marry, and many see this as a very romantic thing to do.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</h3>\n<p>The court minstrel is often seen about town, drinking and playing almost anywhere as the whim takes him: he has even been known to serenade people walking in the parks. He is popular (‘not stuck up like some o’ them Elves you see’), but has very few close friends: @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmeidehammer} is one.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</h3>\n<p>Known as ‘the Princess’ to one and all, Katarina is universally loved for her beauty, grace, and innocence. She may be only a Graf 's daughter by rank, but she has all the attributes of a storybook princess. Young noblewomen copy everything she wears, and young noblemen dream of winning her love. There is constant speculation about whom she might marry and when, which the lack of any official announcement only serves to intensify.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Lady Hildegarde Zimperlich}</h3>\n<p>As chaperone to the ‘Princess’, Lady Hildegarde is a polarising figure. Her detractors (mainly young) think that she is an impediment to the ideal love and perfect wedding that must surely be imminent, while her admirers (mostly old) praise her for keeping the young woman’s reputation secure, and guiding her morals on an upright path.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</h3>\n<p>Everyone knows that the three Midden Marshals are the city’s military commanders. Watch Commander @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann} keeps the peace within the city; General @Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Johann Schwermutt} commands the garrison that mans the walls and gates; and Marshal @Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Maximillian von Genscher} commands the joint field army of Middenheim and Middenland. The general opinion is that all three are competent commanders, but few people know them personally.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The High Wizard and his Deputy}</h3>\n<p>Wizards have played a role in Middenheim’s defence since the earliest days, and @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Middenheim’s Grand Guild of Wizards} enjoys a great deal of influence within the city. High Wizard @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher} and Deputy High Wizard @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} are the faces of the Guild, consulted by the Graf on magical matters, but not generally regarded as members of the court. Helseher is a quiet and reserved man, which leads some citizens to think him very wise but a little stuffy. Eberhauer is younger, more attractive, and more outgoing, all of which make her popular. She is seen as more approachable than her superior, and almost as learned.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}</h3>\n<p>No follower of Ulric uses the phrase ‘high priest of Ulric’ — unless they are explaining his position to an outsider. As head of the second largest religion in the Empire, guardian of Middenheim’s most sacred shrine, and an Elector in his own right, @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} commands enormous respect in the city. Few know him as an individual, but everyone thinks of a paragon of Ulrican virtues when his name is mentioned.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{The Ladies At Court}</h3>\n<p>No court is complete without some ladies to bring it beauty and culture, and to act as guides and aides to visiting dignitaries.

Middenheimers  who frequent the city’s top theatres, restaurants, and hostelries may have seen @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} in the company of @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} and the two Elves, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} and @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}. Almost everyone knows that Dieter and Kirsten are engaged to be married.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{The Knight Eternal}</h3>\n<p>The post of Knight Eternal dates back to Middenheim’s earliest history. Everyone knows of the tradition that his presence protects the city in some imprecise, mystical way. @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} is neither the best knight to hold this ceremonial post, nor the worst — but those who know him would certainly agree that he must surely be the most pompous. To everyone else, he is a cipher: they know there is a person inside that suit of armour, and some may know his name, but it is the post that is important, not the man.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}</h3>\n<p>Hunting is a favourite pastime among the Empire’s nobility. Every landowner with pretensions to quality sets some of their land aside for a hunting-park. A great ruler like Graf Boris maintains vast hunting estates in the Drakwald. Wood Elf @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} supervises these estates. In town, he has a reputation as a hard drinker and something of a heartbreaker, but Allavandrel’s undeniable charisma leads most to see him as a charming rogue rather than a lecherous rake. His defence of his title in the Carnival’s archery tournament always draws a crowd: he has been undefeated for as long as most Human residents can remember.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}</h3>\n<p>If Allavandrel is regarded as a charming rogue, Wallenstein is seen as a rogue of the other variety. The chairman of both the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild} and the City @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission on Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, he walks both sides of the divide between merchants and government, and uses his position to enrich himself first, and his fellow merchants second: everyone else can look out for themselves. Wallenstein is often seen about town, either trying to endear himself to some person of influence at court, or forcing his attention on some attractive young woman. To anyone who is of no use to him, he is unfailingly rude and dismissive.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Doktor Luigi Pavarotti}</h3>\n<p>This ebullient Tilean joined the court fairly recently at the suggestion of Baron Heinrich Todbringer, the illegitimate but acknowledged son who serves @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} as a roving ambassador. Larger than life in both personality and appetites, he has become notorious around the city’s fleshpots and drinking halls, but all agree that there is no real harm in him. It is rumoured that the sickly @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan}, the Graf ’s legitimate heir, is becoming much stronger under his care.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</h3>\n<p>Everyone knows that there are three of them, and they advise the Graf on legal matters. Very few can name all three, and almost no one can tell why there are three, or what the differences are between them. Their names are @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Reiner Ehrlich}, @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Joachim Hoflich}, and @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}.</p>\n<p>They are seldom seen outside the palace or the city’s higher courts.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[DaFBBnxKhlfREOwy]{A Servant of Tzeentch}</h3>\n<p>While in Bögenhafen, the Characters have encountered @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eisactors.IvvkdVTJzutEsrlX]{Gideon}, the shapeshifting Lesser Daemon of Tzeentch who served as an advisor, and ultimate betrayer, to the @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eisactors.LG5qATEIFPE9bezB]{adventure’s villain}. As another servant of Tzeentch, the villain may have recruited a similar creature, with similar shapeshifting abilities, to impersonate the murdered party.</p>\n<h3>A Magic Trick</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the imposter is not a monster at all, but a confederate of the Purple Hand using some kind of illusion or shapeshifting magic.</p>\n<p>The Lore of Shadows Spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.OcYPErjJzQKOX2aI]{Doppelgänger} lasts only for a few minutes, but a powerful wizard-artificer could have made a talisman or ring that creates the same effect for as long as the item is worn. The item could serve as a clue to the imposture, since the impersonated character owned nothing like it; and of course, there is always the chance that someone closely acquainted with the subject notices that some mannerism is not quite right.</p>\n<p>A magical potion might have a similar effect, but last only 24 hours per dose. In that case, the regular deliveries of fresh doses might be noticed — and of course, if the supply is cut off, the conspirators have to come up with some excuse or diversion quickly, or fresh suspicions will be raised.</p>\n<h3>A Dead-On Likeness</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the murder victim is impersonating himself (or herself ) thanks to some necromantic magic. After the murder — which must be neat enough that normal clothing can cover any wounds — the victim was raised as a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombie} or similar creature under the necromancer’s control.</p>\n<p>The deception can be maintained as long as the body shows no obvious signs of decay — which might be delayed using a more powerful version of the Petty Magic Spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.cSjAAjixcMdYrKBz]{Conserve}. Speech might be simulated using @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.pDvOunMrvaYoXjd9]{Murmured Whisper} or some similar enchantment, coupled with a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perform (Act)</strong> Test to create a convincing version of the character’s voice. Disguising the clumsiness of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombie’s} movement is more difficult, but not beyond the scope of magic. Eventually, though, this deception has too many moving parts to withstand close or extended scrutiny: sooner or later, something must inevitably go wrong.</p>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/temple.webp\" width=\"307\" height=\"389\" /></p>\n<p>A friendly — or bribed — @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T5qAtpoKtB8iwTBd]{Vampire} might turn the victim undead instead. This process leaves the victim’s appearance more or less unchanged, requiring only a little make-up to hide the sudden pallor. The newly undead victim might be controlled by their Vampiric sire (although not explicitly stated in the WFRP rulebook, this is a common piece of Vampire lore that does not seem out of place), ensuring that they go along with the plan — unless, of course, Vampiric urges overwhelm the neonate’s will, or the ‘sire’ Vampire decides to double-cross the Purple Hand and use this well-placed puppet for purposes of their own.</p>","folder":"aBfHQxuCZtZmIndI","sort":25000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 3: The Evil Plot","sort":25000}}}

{"_id":"BRFG82wEhR3OCLzW","name":"The Crowds","content":"<p>Middenheim’s streets are packed during Carnival week, and the crowds provide opportunities and challenges in equal measure. One the one hand, characters with suitable Skills can try their hand at busking to make a little money, and characters with the ability to make things can try to sell them; on the other, the crowds make any kind of pursuit or shadowing more difficult.</p>\n<h3>Busking</h3>\n<p>Buskers and street performers are everywhere during Carnival week; every doorway, street corner or steps becomes a makeshift stage. tThe Characters may try their hand at earning a few pennies themselves, and/or using Skills to create a distraction while other party members indulge in some questionable activity.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of people trying to make money at the Carnival, which means the  competition is fierce. The standard of busking and other entertainments is very high — so high, in fact, that substandard performers are often pelted with rotten fruit rather than showered with money! Indeed, some Middenheimers make a few extra coins during Carnival by selling over-ripe fruit with just the right blend of firmness for throwing, and softness to produce a good splatter!</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE BUSKERS ART</em></h3>\n<p><em>The competition among buskers is intense, sometimes vicious, during the Carnival. Middenheim’s resident street performers stop at nothing to defend the best ‘pitches,’ or locations, while there is so much entertainment available that most passers-by are very hard to impress. Only the very best performances, or the most exotic forms of entertainment, will move them to part with their cash. This means that the relevant Tests are modified as follows:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Commonplace Entertainments (–20)</strong>: Entertain (Comedy, Singing, Storytelling); Perform (Dancing —  local); Play (common instrument); Sleight of Hand.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Unusual Entertainments (–10)</strong>: Entertain (Acting); Perform (Acrobatics, Clowning, Juggling, Miming, Dancing — artistic); Play (unusual instrument).<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Exotic Entertainments (no modifier)</strong>: Perform (Firebreathing, Ropewalking); Perform (Dancing — foreign); Play (foreign instrument).</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>You decide whether an instrument or a style of dance is sufficiently novel and interesting to merit a reduced penalty. The same applies to any act the Characters may devise that is based on other Skills.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Presto!</h3>\n<p>Spellcasters may try to busk using their more visually impressive spells, but this can be risky. The consequences are up to you, but may range from representatives of the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Grand Guild of Wizards} warning the Characters that Guild rules prohibit public performance by non-members (this may be true or not, and in either case the officials may imposes a spot fine, which itself may be legitimate or not) to a panicked stampede caused by a miscast, which might see the Characters arrested and charged with anything from breach of the peace to public endangerment to witchcraft.</p>\n<h4>It Looked So Real</h4>\n<p>Performances and demonstrations that require a lot of space will get a busker into trouble, and so will anything that looks like fighting. Warrior types who stage impromptu demonstrations of trick riding, sharpshooting, or combat run several risks in addition to arrest. These risks could include an accident or a sudden surge from the crowd can lead to injuries; passing mercenaries could mistake the demonstration for a fight and wade in — or set out to show off their own skills or ruin the Characters’ performance in embarrassing and painful ways; a near miss or any other mishap could cause a panicked stampede; and so on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the Characters somehow manage to evade arrest for such a performance, they are warmly advised, according to their rank, to try to impress the crowds at the @JournalEntry[asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials} by fighting the Graf ’s champion, or to go and fight the Minotaur at the @JournalEntry[eM2ZiVNgS7dzI2bA]{Bernabau stadium}.</p>\n<h4>We Are Not Amused</h4>\n<p>Apart from flying fruit, a particularly unsuccessful entertainer (for instance, an Impressive or worse failure) may be brought to the attention of the Busk Umpires, a group of officials employed to monitor the quality of street entertainments. The Umpires may be called — if an individual is so bad as to ‘be an affront to the profession or skill he or she is attempting to emulate, and cause embarrassment to any assemblage so gathered.’ The crowd may detain the individual until an Umpire arrives, at which point he or she must perform again; a similar failure results in 6 hours in the stocks for a first offence and an overnight stay in the stocks for the second. A third offence sees the busker expelled from the city.</p>\n<h3>Hawking</h3>\n<p>The crowds draw all manner of hawkers and hucksters. Characters with suitable Skills or careers may try to make a little money for themselves.</p>\n<p>Apothecaries, herbalists, and similar characters may try to sell herbal potions and remedies — those sold as cures for headaches, infected wounds, and upset stomachs are in demand, and gain a +10 bonus to all Haggle and other relevant Tests.</p>\n<p>Pedlars and the like may try to sell their wares to the passing crowds, although anything that is not food, drink, or marked ‘A Souvenir of Middenheim’ suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests involved in selling.</p>\n<p>Mystics and others with similar Skills may try to turn a coin telling fortunes, but this is difficult in high-traffic areas where many people are passing through (–10 penalty): folk in the quieter areas are more willing to stop, but there are fewer of them.</p>\n<h3>Preaching</h3>\n<p>Priests and other religious characters may decide to preach to the crowds, either for money or in the cause of their religion. Agitators may do likewise. If they are too successful, they may draw  a large  crowd and be moved on by the Watch, perhaps with a fine for obstructing a public thoroughfare. If their words or their performance cause offence, they could find themselves in the middle of a riot, or on the receiving end of some well-aimed fruit, stones, or dung. With religious tensions still high, despite the more relaxed atmosphere of the Carnival, Sigmarite priests run particularly high risks.</p>","folder":"3FmEzDwm1adAgzPx","sort":150000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 5: The Carnival","sort":150000}}}

He will attend many Carnival events, and is particularly looking forward to the opera recitals. He might also be encountered at almost any hostelry, food market, or house of ill repute. If the Characters witness him ministering to @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan}, they will see him using @Item[vXJq3j6MGR3oThG0]{hypnosis}.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Attractive people and Elves: Anyone with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.6l3jvIAvrKxt0lA9]{Attractive} Talent will always benefit from it when interacting with Luigi, even if they have wronged him in the past. Treat all Elf Characters as if they have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.6l3jvIAvrKxt0lA9]{Attractive} Talent when dealing with Luigi.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Luigi knows nothing important, save for his perceptions about @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} (see below). Beside his modest influence, his main importance is his @Item[vXJq3j6MGR3oThG0]{Hypnotism} skill, which could help free @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} from the suggestions that force him to support the new taxes (see ‘@JournalEntry[m2iCtJ3eBsUwP0Dd]{You Are Feeling Sleepy...},’). His medical and herbal Skills might also be useful.</p>\n<p>Luigi’s devil-may-care attitude and foreign origins may lead to some initial suspicions, and close association with him will cause friction with the more respectable major NPCs (not least the @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Chaperone}). However, if Characters can satisfy his goals and appetites — an expensive, exhausting, and potentially embarrassing undertaking — and clearly mean no harm to him or to the Todbringer family, he can be a very helpful contact.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Luigi has little idea of who influences Graf Boris. He underestimates his own influence, but the Graf would listen to him out of gratitude for his work with Stefan.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Luigi is entirely unconcerned with politics: his goals revolve around carnal pleasures of all kinds, and the welfare of Baron Stefan.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Sadly repressed. Luigi has observed the recent changes in his behaviour and has wondered if Sparsam is taking something, but remains uncertain. He will not mention the possibility unless the Characters suggest it first.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Thinks he may have seen him briefly. Sad that he is to be married; regards marriage as the end of pleasure.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Likes his music and knows of his carousing reputation: would like to know him better.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘Princess’</strong>: Knows that she is far above his station, but has a soft spot for her all the same. Considers her charming, and will voice his support for any likeable Character who attempts to win her friendship, or indeed her heart.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: A repressed old hag who would destroy all pleasures simply because she lacks the capacity for enjoyment.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Knows nothing of them, and will try to steer the conversation toward his own exploits against pirates as an Admiral of the Tilean Navy. His wild (but completely true) stories go on for hours unless someone stops him, in which case he will good-naturedly promise to finish the story later.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Knows nothing of them, but thinks he has seen Janna Eberhauer at a court event, and will beg the Characters to introduce him to her. He has an interest in Jade magic, although he will not give this away. Whilst he is a layman, magic is not strange to him — Luigi has lived an interesting life.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: No strong feelings. Secretly he has noted the High Priest’s anxiety and strongly suspects some forbidden affair, but does not know, or care, who the other party might be.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: Unaware that she is the Graf ’s paramour, and would not have approached her romantically had he known. Admits frankly that she turned him down, and seems genuinely puzzled– especially since he told her of his herbal preparations for enhancing one’s vigour.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Despite his mannerisims, Luigi is the heart of discretion. He does not readily admit to his exploits with Petra and Natasha, but it can be wheedled out of him eventually. Knows Kirsten is to be married (but not to whom) and has made no advances to her: <em>‘Married? Of course! But not one about to be married, for such love is still true!’ </em></p>\n<p>Luigi will wax poetic — in his usual, shockingly forthright way — about the beauty, grace, and charm they bring to the court.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Has never heard of him, but would ridicule him thoroughly if told about him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Met him briefly while slightly hung-over and melancholic; liked him and will be pleased to learn of his dissolute nature, immediately suggesting a party for the two of them and a few friends.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}— Komission Convenor</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Knows them only by reputation, but feels that Middenheim’s licensing laws should be revised so he can go carousing at any hour, day or night, as he could in Miragliano.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer: </strong>He likes Rothbert, as he’s always up for a drink and he knows some interesting people.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Knows that his manner bothers Breugal, and misses no opportunity to cause him discomfort. There is no malice in it, though: Luigi simply can’t help himself.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>He’s never heard of her.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>Pavarotti feels a twinge of guilt that he hasn’t yet visited the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya}. Very soon he will visit to pray, explain his absence, and try to seduce the priestess</p>\n<h3>Luigi Versus Hildegarde</h3>\n<p>If the Characters follow the @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{chaperone’s} suggestion to try to remove Luigi, the Physician will readily forgive them and hatch a counter-plot should they inform him. This could work to their advantage.</p>\n<p>Luigi can let the Characters know that for all her apparent airs @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde} loves nothing more than a tense game of cards, @Compendium[wfrp4e-rnhd.pubgames.pWlAzCU8HjElHsqC]{Red Empress} and Cripple My Pig being favourites. If the Characters can host an entertaining game at a suitable venue, and keep the wine flowing freely, the chapperone will likely spend the following day dealing with her hangover. In order to do this successfully characters would have to meet Hildgarde at an event such as the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}, tactfully suggest to her that they are serious players about to host a game with moderate stakes (she would consider penny stakes too cheap, but crowns to be too vulgar), and then remain charming whilst ensuring that she is challenged without being trounced. Provided the games are closely fought and the atmosphere convivial, she will happily drink herself into a stupor.</p>\n<p>While this will not remove Hildegarde completely, she will be less perceptive than usual while hungover (-30 to all Tests in locations of bright light or loud noises — essentially every Carnival event), and may fail to accompany @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katerina} at all if she is feeling particularly poorly. This will allow Characters an opportunity to make Katerina's acquaintance and benefit from whatever insight, introductions, and prestiege conversing with her might provide.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Reictals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Lightsingers}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Barnumble’s Incredible Elephant Show}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 3}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 4}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Final}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 1)}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 2)}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/luigi-pavarotti.webp","folder":"So1PdVn4b7FXXZLo","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}

The party might be attracted by the noise of the mob, or by the sight of the Chancellor running through the streets, dodging a barrage of rotten fruit, or worse. If the party has a Dwarf member, they may not need to wait for a mob: a Dwarf Character could decide or be convinced to attack the Chancellor, allowing the other Characters to ‘rescue’ him. If the party rescues Sparsam he is  grateful — more so if the Characters see him safely to his home or to the Palace.</p>\n<p>Sparsam can also be encountered through his interest in antiques. If the Characters know what he looks like, they could recognise him at an auction or sale. He has his eye on one particular object, but is probably bidding on others as well, to hide his interest. Bidding against the Chancellor may prove expensive, at least at first — but while rich, Sparsam is miserly, and pulls out of the sale when the bidding reaches 10% above an item’s worth (for example, at 11 GCs for something worth 10 GCs).

{"_id":"EWhez41BvMuwznUT","name":"NPC Strategy","content":"<p>Obviously, this depends on how much warning the pawns have, if they are asleep at the time, and so on. If they have already made an attack on the Characters they will be highly vigilant, and likewise, if the Characters have announced their presence by smashing down locked doors, they will be forewarned. These NPCs are fairly brave (save for @Actor[eeJoYIenRt8CbtVU]{Anton}): @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde} and @Actor[klwNbpAHe1oQ1oo6]{Dagmar} are unlikely to surrender, and @Actor[frMWa4mngN7z7n3g]{Hultz} will not do so unless offered amnesty. It is unlikely that any will be able to escape, although Brunhilde will try to get away to warn Wasmeier. Unfortunately, even if she does escape, Wasmeier will not be at home for most of Festag night, having other plans for the evening (see @JournalEntry[Vc09tZNuKQcfD7QP]{The Court Climax})</p>\n<h3>Advancing The Plotline</h3>\n<p>If the Characters discover the lair on Festag night, events are set to increase in pace. Assuming the love-letters have been found, the Characters should be able to guess who wrote them, and how politically sensitive they are. Even if they were unaware of the blackmail pressure on Ar-Ulric before, they should now understand why he has been silent on the tax issue. However, Reya Ehrlich is their biggest gain by far.  i. When ungagged, Reya will prove to be an independent and plucky sort, demanding to be taken to her uncle @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich} — ‘he’ll know what to do!’ — or someone else in authority. In all probability, the Characters are quite unaware of the pressure exerted on @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich}, and Reyas presence should be one more piece of the jigsaw.</p>\n<h4>Premature Annihilation</h4>\n<p>If the party deals with the pawns before Festag night, things change slightly. Reya Ehrlich is not in the lair. Instead of love-letters, the party finds a partly-burnt scrap of paper in the ashes close to the aviary. All that is readable (in code) is a place (of your choosing, in the @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}), and a time (11.30pm Festag night). This is where another group of cultists — or the Skaven, if they have not yet been encountered — hand over Reya and the love-letters to Klaglich. After that, events should continue as described above.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich}  is killed, the first @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} knows about  it is when she fails to act on one of his messages, which may take time. He starts investigations using minor cultists, and if he discovers the lair has been attacked, he instructs a second group of cultists to take delivery of Reya and the letters. Since the original lair has been discovered, the cultists will plant the evidence in another run-down house. This meeting could get very complicated as both Characters and cultists wait for the same ‘shipment.’</p>\n<p>Finally, if @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} escapes an early attack, @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} will be warned immediately. Since neither of them knows that the Characters know of the handover on Festag night, there is no reason why the aforementioned delivery will not take place, but in this instance, it will be Klaglich waiting for the girl and letters, rather than other cultists. She  then plants the evidence as described in @JournalEntry[Vc09tZNuKQcfD7QP]{‘The Court Climax’}.</p>","folder":"NdV140BH3D9p6vpI","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 7: The Traitor Unmasked","sort":200000}}}
{"_id":"EgezB9BzxKmohox9","name":"Grubentreich","content":"<p>The village itself comprises around 80 simple country folk, who make a moderate living from agriculture and livestock.</p>\n<p>Mathilde and Eduard Jung, the sisters’ aunt and uncle, run the <em>Black Sheep </em>tavern. They are grateful to the Characters for having rescued their nieces, and offer the party free accommodation, food, and drink for the night. Unfortunately, the inn’s two guest rooms have already been taken, but the taproom is clean and warm.</p>\n<p>If the Characters don’t mention the encounter with the flying skull, one of the girls certainly does so. This may happen while the bar is still full of locals, or last thing at night, as Eduard locks up the tavern. Talking with the locals brings nothing more than sceptical comments about ‘bumps on the head’ obtained during the crash. Eduard is not so dismissive, though. The description of the crash backs up the rumour he heard two days ago from Werner Geizhals, a wine merchant returning from the nearby village of Pritzstock.</p>\n<p>According to Geizhals, who travelled on to Middenheim for the Carnival, the folk of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} gave him the impression that the village was cursed. There were tales of the dead prowling around the outskirts of the village, and of phantom, flying skulls haunting the woods. Eduard broaches the subject with the Characters quietly, after the tavern has emptied out for the night. If they are real, these flying skulls should be dealt with before the threat spreads to Grubentreich, and who better to deal with them than these recently arrived adventurers?</p>\n<p>If the Characters look like they do not intend to investigate, Eduard elaborates on the rumours, making up tales that the skulls are thought to guard some long-lost treasure or whatever else he thinks will motivate the party to investigate. Bertha will not hesitate to urge the Characters to assist, especially if during the coach tide they told her tales of their previous exploits. Finally, should all else fail, Eduard will offer @Credit[2gc,SPLIT]{2 GC} as recompense if the Characters should investigate. He and Mathilde are worried that the worsening reputation of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} will spread and cast a cloud over Grubentreich and the <em>Black Sheep</em>.</p>\n<p>As chance would have it, three of the inn’s other guests are travelling through @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} the following day: a farmer named Hans Krug, and handymen Pieter Klammerer and Albrecht Krupp. These three retired to the guest rooms early, but are returning to Leichlinberg via Pritzstock tomorrow. The Characters could get a lift to the village on Krug’s carts.</p>\n<p>The Characters must rise early to ask Hans Krug for a spot on the carts, so woe betide those who over-indulged on Eduard’s hospitality. The farmer agrees willingly enough, but asks for @Pay[1ss]{1 shilling} each as payment. He can be bargained down to @Pay[6bp]{6 pennies} each, but being poor he tries to make money whenever he can. Talking him down requires a successful <strong>Difficult (–10) Haggle</strong> Test. If the Characters really need encouragement to investigate, Eduard offers to pay the fare. They need have no further concern about Elise and Bertha: Eduard assures them that he will personally escort them to Middenheim on the next coach.</p>\n<p>The journey to @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} takes about three hours on Krug’s cart. The only other way that the Characters could make the trip is on foot, as there are no horses available for hire or sale. The farmer and his assistants know nothing of events at Pritzstock, having just returned from a trip to Middenheim.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/villagers.webp\" width=\"282\" height=\"265\" /></div>","img":null,"folder":"XPM9XriCft4SkXW7","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":300000}}}

He can be found at the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission} offices every day except Festag. He works from 8 in the morning until 7 at night. On Festags he spends the morning in the @JournalEntry[7wu8onhV4JEAuEfn]{Chapel of Grungni}. The rest of the time he splits between drinking in the Coppershiners tavern, or pottering about his @JournalEntry[y4MpfiD6PHBOAdX0]{Sudtor} home reviewing notes and reading. </p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Dwarfs have a bonus of +10 to any Fellowship Tests with Thognar. He is a little lonely, so female Dwarfs are subjected to mooning but coquettish fascination. </p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Thognar has little knowledge about the opinions and motives of the influencers at the Graf ’s court. He is not very perceptive and blinded by his prejudices. His superior, Convenor Magradil, shares his views, and the two of them spend a lot of time in conference where they reinforce each other’s perspectives. </p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Thognar does not really know who has the ear of the Graf, and is humble enough not to speculate on matters he doesn’t understand. The exception to this is that he is convinced Rallane possesses undue influence, and exercises it against Dwarf interests. </p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Thognar’s goals at this time are to organise a petition against the Dwarf tax, see the influence of Elves reduced at the Graf ’s court, and promote Dwarf interests in Middenheim.</p>\n<h2>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</h2>\n<p>Both literally and figuratively, Clerk Thognar is not a lofty member of Middenheim society (though to point this out would earn his resentment). Most of the characters from <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> have no interest in the concerns of the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission for Elf, Dwarf, and Halfling Interests}, and Thognar does not mix with high society outside of work. </p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: Until recently Thognar respected the Chancellor’s conservative approach but is deeply distressed by the introduction of the Dwarf tax. He is making up his mind whether to hate Sparsam, directing his anger at Rallane in the meantime.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: They have never met, but Thognar has heard of the good opinion Dieter has of Dwarfs, and acquaintances have shared anecdotes about the champion’s friendly behaviour and ability to hold his drink. The two attend the Festival of Fine Ales together during the course of the adventure, where Thognar attempts to persuade Dieter to sign his petition. If Dieter refuses due to being hypnotised, Thognar grows furious and may voice his opinion of Rallane.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: Rallane is the focus of Thognar’s bitterness. He is obsessed with the Elf and whilst he keeps his lips sealed when at work, he complains about the minstrel openly if he has had a drink. He believes that Rallane has a deep and long-held hatred of Dwarfs, resents them for their hard work, and has swayed the Graf against his better judgement. Thognar privately entertains thoughts that the Elf has woven spells into his songs that have weakened the resolve of the courtiers. If he is presented with evidence that hypnotism or drugs have been used to control people, he quickly blames Rallane, even concocting anecdotes and circumstantial evidence to support his suspicion.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: He has respect for her according to her station, but they have never interacted.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: No idea who she is.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Thognar has respect for Middenheim’s military, but no dealings with them.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Wizards are better integrated in Middenheim society than they are elsewhere in the Empire, and have a long history of constructive cooperation with the city’s military. As such, Thognar is respectful of the Wizards, though he does not know them personally.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Thognar is a little leery of the Ulrican cult; he has little time for Human gods and is dimly aware that Ar-Ulric has voiced his approval of the taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Dwarfs tend to find the whole notion of people employed for their ability to beguile and charm to be dishonourable. He has no time for Ladies at Court as a concept, though he has nothing against them personally.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: For some reason Thognar does not regard Allavandrel with the degree of malice that he does Rallane. This is an unconscious bias — Thognar has respect for Allavandrel’s skill in hunting and carousing. Forced to acknowledge this inconsistency, he would quickly decide that Allavandrel is in cahoots with @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane}, and equally deserving of opprobrium.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Thognar is acquainted with Gotthard thanks to a few functions at which various Komission staff have mingled. He affords Gotthard grudging respect, as the man is in a similar line of work and apparently successful. He is aware that Gotthard is pleased with the taxes, but cannot bring himself to dislike him for it. It is, after all, the fault of the Elves rather than the merchants.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: No idea who he is.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Thognar is bitterly disappointed by the three Law Lords, men he had previously respected. Convenor Magradil has been to see them since the introduction of the taxes and reports that Erlich has supported the taxes but doesn’t respond to any requests to explain himself, that Hoflich supports the taxes and is cold and indifferent when asked why, and that Wasmeier, whilst apparently against the taxes, is unwilling to oppose them in any serious manner.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal} – Chamberlain</strong>: Thognar imagines they have a nodding acquaintance thanks to his occasional visits to the palace, and respects Breugal’s obvious diligence. Breugal does not know who Thognar is.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>He attends a few Carnival events, mostly to talk with other Dwarfs and drum up support for his petition. He quickly leaves any space Rallane enters.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales} (8–11)</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Black Pool Illuminations} (9–11)</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants/Jousting} (2–5)</p>","folder":"udGynnL2hxddlr6Q","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":500000}}}
{"_id":"GB84Qjm9NFUsPR4W","name":"Concluding the Adventure","content":"<p>This adventure can end in one of three ways: with @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} dead, captured, or escaped. For the continuity of the ‘Gravelord’ adventures (which continue in <strong>The Horned Rat Companion</strong>) the third outcome is desirable, but if it cannot happen without blatantly fudging the game, there are other options.</p>\n<h3>Gräber Escaped</h3>\n<p>If his escape plan succeeds, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} can make a getaway into the woods while the Beastman Skeletons hamper any pursuit. By the time the Characters free themselves and try to follow, he has a good head start, and the GM can help him make good his escape by having a sudden thunderstorm wash away any tracks.</p>\n<p>The Characters trudge back to the village, soaked to the bone by the time they arrive, and report on what has happened. The cave can be cleared of its bones and blessed by a wandering priest of Morr, the skulls destroyed, and the harvest can begin — with everyone keeping one eye over their shoulder for any further threats — as the party resume their interrupted journey.</p>\n<h3>Gräber Captured</h3>\n<p>Capture will not dampen @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} spirits at all, and he will keep up a steady flow of invective and grandiose threats until the Characters decide to silence him.</p>\n<p>The road wardens summoned by Hedric the coachman — or perhaps a witch hunter, brought to the village by the spreading news of a necromantic threat in the area — arrive just as the Characters conduct their bound captive to the village. Several villagers recognise him, and if the Characters have not yet heard the story of his prior humiliation, this is a good opportunity to fill in any blanks.</p>\n<p>The Characters resume their journey to Middenheim with the thanks of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock’s} villagers. Along the way they pass a huddle of corpses by the roadside, and they recognise the road wardens or the witch hunter’s band, just as the bodies rise up as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies} and attack. A moment before combat begins, a familiar, whining voice rings out from the brush beyond the road.<em> ‘You cannot defeat the Gravelord! Now you pay, foolish mortals!’ </em>By the time any of the Characters fights clear of the Zombies and tries to pursue, Gräber has gone.</p>\n<h3>Gräber Dead</h3>\n<p>Given that this adventure is part of an ongoing series, it may seem like a bad outcome to have Gräber killed. But death is not the end of the world, and certainly not the end of the Gravelord! There are various ways to ensure that he returns in future adventures.</p>\n<p><strong>Fate Points</strong>: Player Characters need not be the only ones with a destiny. Although giving Fate Points to NPCs and monsters is not generally encouraged, a recurring nemesis character is a good exception to make. If Gräber is killed and left for dead, he invokes the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.01PN4MXAyw3mxvZl]{Die Another Day} option and manages to escape while no one is looking — or he simply revives sufficiently to be captured.</p>\n<p><strong>Undying Hatred</strong>: His body may lie mangled and bleeding, but thanks to the dramatic circumstances or some previously unknown necromantic magic, the vengeful spirit of the Gravelord lives on. He becomes a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.GgSxlomoV220kd3G]{Ghost} or a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.hMbcLVjk7eUdxtqC]{Cairn Wraith} — or perhaps, to his baffled embarrassment, the first recorded male @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.TWy5l4uYTRAtjfit]{Tomb Banshee}, as befits his voice — and continues to harass the Characters with unexpected hit-and-run attacks. At the GM’s option, he retains his spellcasting abilities, and he is not @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.D0ImWEIMSDgElsnl]{Unstable} as long as he pursues his vengeance with his normal single-minded determination.</p>\n<p><strong>Body Thief</strong>: Instead of becoming a disembodied spirit — or perhaps in addition to it — @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} has the ability to possess a living body by winning an Opposed Willpower Test. This need not be one of the Characters, or even a humanoid creature — he might jump to the body of a nearby squirrel or rabbit, or even take over poor Seel or @Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder} as they come to explore the cave the following day. Later, the Characters encounter a complete stranger, who speaks in a very familiar way and bears an unquenchable grudge against them.</p>\n<h3>Experience Points</h3>\n<p>Beyond any points you offer for good roleplaying and clever ideas at the end of the session, XP should be awarded for the following:</p>\n<p>@Exp[10,For making a favourable impression on a named NPC.]{10 points for making a favourable impression on a named NPC.}</p>\n<p>@Exp[20,For coming up with a plan to track the skulls.]{20 points for coming up with a plan to track the skulls.}</p>\n<p>@Exp[20,For an imaginative or diplomatic investigation in Pritzstock]{20 points for an imaginative or diplomatic investigation in Pritzstock}</p>\n<p>@Exp[20,For dealing with each Skull attack]{20 points for dealing with each Skull attack}</p>\n<p>@Exp[10,If the villages were mobilized to deal with the Skulls ]{10 points if the villages were mobilized to del with the Skulls }</p>\n<p>@Exp[10,If the harvest is saved]{10 points if the harvest is saved}</p>\n<p>@Exp[10,If they haggled well over their reward.]{10 points if they haggled well over their reward.}</p>\n<p>@Exp[40,For dealing with Gräber]{40 points for dealing with Gräber}</p>","folder":"XPM9XriCft4SkXW7","sort":650000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":650000}}}

{"_id":"KBETPITI2Gk9svZT","name":"Nastassia, The Spy","content":"<p>Nastassia — the Characters never learn her real surname — is the trusted agent of Baron @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich Todbringer}, the illegitimate son of Graf Boris. He has taken on the responsibility for many diplomatic missions since his father began to decline.  At the moment he is away in Wolfenburg on a diplomatic errand. Nastassia is keeping an eye on the city in his absence. </p>\n<h3>Using Nastassia</h3>\n<p>No one ever mentions Nastassia to the Characters, for the simple reason that nobody knows who she is, or whom she works for. She has her own home in Middenheim, and is never seen with Heinrich. Her role is simply to socialise with people on the edges of diplomatic and government circles, learning what she can and reporting back to Heinrich. A lot of her time is spent in the company of minor clerks, who are pleased to brag about their jobs to impress such an attractive woman. She has contacts and spies of her own in several major cities in the Empire, and in the Tilean City States. Nastassia is fully capable of stealing documents and undertaking other covert activities when necessary.</p>\n<p>If the Players are getting into a hopeless mess — truly hopeless, that is — Nastassia can give them some invisible help. Her role as Heinrich’s spy means that she is well placed to hear lots of minor gossip, including news on the party’s activities. Intuition tell her that something is going on, and she investigates indirectly — using the Characters as pawns, if possible — reporting any concrete information to Baron @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich}.</p>\n<p>She might prompt the Characters with helpful (and anonymous) notes, messages and so on. To keep some mysteries for the players to unravel, she does not know about the central intrigues within Middenheim: only snippets of odd behaviour connected with major NPCs. Her prompts should be used sparingly, and experience point awards should be adjusted to take account of her assistance.</p>\n<p>For example, she may know the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} and the @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Paramour} are having an affair, and the High Priest has been showing signs of anxiety<br /><br /></li>\n<li>the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} is an addict, and Brunhilde Klaglich (alias ‘Frau Kenner’) is his dealer, having bought the illicit concoction from a place called ‘the Pit’<br /><br /></li>\n<li>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} can be trusted (having met him on a visit to the Tilean City States)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>…and so on.</p>\n<p>Her help should be minimal: just enough to point the Characters in the right direction, and not so much that they stop trying and simply wait for orders. @Actor[bUILl7b6hxsVqIqu]{Nastassia} only helps if she believes that the Characters are genuinely trying to do something helpful and constructive about the problems in Middenheim. Perhaps she sits not far away from them in a tavern at some time and overhears their conversations, or rents a room next to theirs and listens through the wall. More details on @JournalEntry[sIsmnZetkg8syrS2]{Nastassia} can be found in the <strong>Power Behind the Throne Companion</strong>.</p>\n<p>Nastassia is very intelligent, highly observant, and an expert at getting other people to talk about themselves and others. She is shrewd, keeps her views to herself, and manipulates others effortlessly, without them even realising.

On the few occasions when she is in public by herself, she is accompanied by a couple of palace guards: at the Fire-Eaters, they are bearers as much as bodyguards, carrying a blanket, a small, folding chair, and a picnic basket, and helping her get comfortable before the show starts.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have met her nephew @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl} — or if they happen to be near her rooms in the palace at the right time — they may hear angry voices as he turns up to demand more money from her.

Beastman attacks on the inn itself are not common, but attacks on coaches have become more common lately, especially to the north of the inn. @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.wVPKOC48Odm7JJMQ]{Four Seasons} has made several attempts to take over the inn, since it is the only accommodation between Kutenholz and Bröckel. This location  would give them a significant advantage over competing lines. So far, though, their efforts have been unsuccessful, and the inn remains independently owned and operated.</p>\n<h4>Bröckel</h4>\n<p>This is an unremarkable small town, serving as a market for the nearby villages of Kupfengrube and Guthugel. The Bröckel Arms, on the southern edge of the town, is owned by Four Seasons. The passengers of other lines must rely on the smaller but more central <em>Market Inn</em>. Built to accommodate local farmers visiting the monthly market, this inn usually has four or five rooms and a dozen or so dormitory spaces free at other times.</p>\n<h4>Mittelweg</h4>\n<p><em>The Half-Way</em> House is one of the oldest inns on the Altdorf-Middenheim road. Its wide surrounding wall still bears the scars of attacks from the forces of Chaos two centuries ago. Named for its position roughly halfway between Altdorf and Middenheim, Mittelweg grew up around the grand House with its distinct turrets, which are now a welcome sight for weary travellers. They stand at each corner, and their two upper levels are equipped with arrow-slits.</p>\n<p><em>The Half-Way</em> House is proud of its history and location, and its staff pride themselves on their warm welcome.  Every evening they put on a ‘halfway celebration’ for travellers, with a fine (if expensive) meal, freely flowing drink, and souvenirs, including their novelty half-glasses and half-pint mugs. These mugs and glasses  appear full-size from one side, but are flat on the other, as if sliced in two vertically. These are normally brought to the table in pairs, with wooden clothes pegs holding the two halves together.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>On The Road Again</em></h3>\n<p><em>The journey north is an opportunity to set the tone of Middenheim. The weather gets colder, passing travellers get more grim, religious and cutural diffferences become more obvious, and rumours abound (@JournalEntry[ri289tDcFl3qOsaT]{News and Rumours}) as Characters hear of the troubles in the city. This is tempered by excitement about the carnival, though veterans of the Schaffenfest in Enemy in Shadows will no doubt be plagued by recollections of Bögenhafen and the calamity that was, hopefully, narrowly avoided there following that festival.</em></p>\n<p><em>All of this simply adds to the sense that Middenheim is about to become a fulcrum of great change in the Empire — which, one way or another, is certain to be true. </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Delberz</h4>\n<p>Travellers are often surprised when their coach arrives at Delberz: according to a number of inaccurate maps that are still in circulation, the town and the River Delb are almost 100 miles south-east of their true positions, and much closer to the River Talabec. Some blame the proximity of the Howling Hills for confusing map-makers, while others recall that @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris Todbringer} recently sacked his chief cartographer, Gulhein Tobwurst, over other, similar errors in his maps. The town itself is the largest on the highway, with a small but busy river-port.</p>\n<p><em>The Great Oak</em> inn, named after a huge and ancient tree that stands in the courtyard, caters to Four Seasons coaches, providing lavish fare for those travelling on and comfortable rooms for those stopping overnight. Most other overnight visitors use <em>The Wheel and Anchor</em> — owned by the town’s Merchants’ Guild,  and therefore immune to commercial acquisition — while midday arrivals are greeted by various hawkers and small shops ranged around the town square.</p>\n<h4>Sotturm</h4>\n<p>Sotturm is a small market town with ambitions. It has long been popular with Middenland’s guildmasters as a place to hold business negotiations: it is a neutral location with no allegiance to any town or city, and its location — on the highway and yet fairly out of the way — means that meetings do not attract too much attention. While the fare at The Tower coaching inn is of excellent quality, true epicures head for The Gilded Harpy: this marble building, with its grotesque yet undeniably masterful statue outside, would not look out of place in the wealthier quarters of Altdorf or Middenheim. Thanks to the wealthy guildmasters, who have bought estates around the town, it does a roaring trade at any time of year.</p>\n<h4>Malstedt</h4>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/imperial-crown.webp\" width=\"387\" height=\"287\" /></p>\n<p>At last, the oppressive forest opens up and the road winds upward through rolling hills. <em>The Imperial Crown</em> at Malstedt is large and welcoming, although its sign has recently been defaced: the gold crown has been painted over, and the head of a white wolf inexpertly added. Likewise, the emblem of Four Seasons Coaches by the door has been daubed over, and the staff no longer turn any coaches away. If asked about the changes, they say that there are some in Middenland who speak openly of seceding from the Empire and creating an Ulrican state in the north. But if pressed further, they claim that they do not know anything more, and hurry off to an urgent task elsewhere.</p>\n<h4>Grubentreich</h4>\n<p>This smallish market town supports a number of local villages and farms. The main local products — the meat, milk, and cheese of sheep and goats that graze the surrounding hills — are on sale everywhere. <em>The Bildhofen Arms</em> is named after the area’s ruler, Duke Leopold, and boasts a goat cheese that is well regarded across Middenland and beyond.</p>\n<h4>Schoninghagen</h4>\n<p>A brass plaque above a side-room at <em>The Skull and Cross</em> bears the inscription: <em>‘Here, in the Year of Sigmar 2369, was signed the Treaty of Schoninghagen, to the great glory of Middenland and the Todbringer Family. May Ulric and Sigmar protect them and bless their loyal subjects.’</em></p>\n<p>A <strong>Lore (History)</strong> Test — <strong>Challenging (+0) </strong>for native Middenlanders and <strong>Hard (–20)</strong> for everyone else — recalls that the treaty settled the details of Grand Duke Gunthar von Bildhofen’s abdication from Middenland, and established that the Baron of Nordland was to pay homage to the Graf of Middenheim. The inn’s staff  proudly tell the tale, if any traveller inquires.</p>\n<h4>Middenheim</h4>\n<p>The final leg of the journey is the shortest by distance, but can often take just as long as the others. All arrivals must go through certain formalities — mostly to do with the city’s new tax laws — and wait their turn to use one of the causeways or chair-lifts that run from the foot of the Ulricsberg to the city.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[ri289tDcFl3qOsaT]{News and Rumours}</p>\n<h3>Encounters</h3>\n<p>These encounters can be used to add variety to the journey, and to foreshadow events to come in Middenheim.</p>\n<h4>Survivors</h4>\n<p>This type of encounter becomes more frequent as the Characters travel deeper into the Drakwald, and tapers off as they come closer to Middenheim. Trudging along the roadside or begging the protection of an inn’s walls at night, the survivors of bandit or mutant attacks are ragged, penniless, and often wounded. Mothers carry children, the unhurt support the injured, and the young help the elderly along as best they can. Some claim to be nobles, and promise that their families will reward the Characters for seeing them safely to Middenheim, or Altdorf, or simply to the next coaching inn. Some of these may even be telling the truth. Others simply cluster around a coach or an armed group, clamouring for aid and protection.</p>\n<h4>Refugees</h4>\n<p>The closer the Characters come to Middenheim, the heavier the refugee traffic becomes, including Sigmarites, priests, dwarfs, alchemists, and wizards. There are Sigmarites of all classes, trades, and professions, telling stories of religious persecution.  Priests — not only of Sigmar but of other religions as well — who second the tales of anti-Sigmarite violence, and add that the Graf has approved a ruinous series of Temple Taxes, whose only purpose must surely be to drive out every religion save the worship of Ulric. In the crowd there are wizards and alchemists, who grumble about a ‘Scroll Tax’ on paper that makes Middenheim too expensive to live in. As well as Middenheim Dwarfs, who grumble about ‘ungrateful Manlings,’ but only admit privately to another Dwarf that they have been taxed beyond their means and lack the gold to remain in the City of the White Wolf.</p>\n<h4>Sons of Ulric</h4>\n<p>Closer still to Middenheim, the Characters are stopped at an impromptu road block. It is manned by a group of local toughs, all wearing the symbol of a wolf ’s head somewhere on their clothing. Declaring themselves to be the Sons of Ulric, they search the Characters’ coach and persons, looking for ‘<em>Sigmarite scum</em>.’ Anyone with anything that might be interpreted as indicating devotion to Sigmar — whether or not it actually does — is robbed, soundly beaten, and turned back into the forest.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the Characters actively resist, the ‘Sons of Ulric’ are more than happy to resort to violence: a wrong word or look is quite sufficient. If the Characters need to be rescued from the resulting fight, a patrol of Knights Panther happens to come down the road, and the knights question both parties. They neither support nor condemn the ‘<em>Sons of Ulric</em>,’ but they ensure that there is no further violence, and allow the Characters to go on their way. They do not, however, involve themselves in any disputes about stolen property.</p>\n<h4>Bandits</h4>\n<p>The forest is a lawless place, and the Characters have already heard that attacks on coaches have increased lately. When the coach encounters a fallen tree across the road, any Character with a clear forward view may attempt a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test to see telltale axe-marks: it was felled on purpose, and as the coach comes to a stop it is surrounded by bandits!</p>\n<p>The numbers and experience of the bandits can vary according to the strength of the party and their travelling companions. Numbers can vary from four or five to a couple of dozen. While the leaders, at least, have a level or two in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.9631KpCQa7jvhmgS]{Outlaw} career, the rest might be local Peasants of various kinds —  or they might be hardened outlaws themselves.</p>\n<p>Instead of outlaws, the bandits might be unemployed mercenaries with @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.FgVH1pPS9oRq0o2Z]{Soldier} and/or other Warrior careers, and banditry may be their way of ‘living off the land’ as they make their way eastward toward Ostland and Talabecland, where the threat of war is looming.</p>\n<p>Most bandits are content to rob their victims of anything valuable or useful, but anyone who looks as though their family is well-to-do — the two daughters of a prosperous Altdorf wool merchant, for example — may be taken prisoner, and their companions sent back to the family with a ransom demand.</p>\n<h4>Beastmen</h4>\n<p>Human bandits are one of the milder threats lurking in the forest. Beastmen are a more savage foe altogether: they certainly kill everyone they encounter, and they are likely to eat them too.</p>\n<p>A Beastman force consists mainly of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.R37OtN5gmPWCYOP3]{Gors}, with a few @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.vrYs3cbxvXtre6rv]{Ungors}. The leader might be a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.cHVOdcEkuatqjYV1]{Bray-Shaman}, or a powerful warrior such as a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.cAK1bMj1ne7HPcxI]{Minotaur} or a Bestigor with an especially powerful set of combat-related Traits and mutations.</p>\n<p>Beastmen might fell a tree or resort to some similar subterfuge to stop a passing vehicle, or they might simply burst from the trees and attack — targeting the horses first so that their victims cannot escape.</p>\n<p>More on coaches and combat can be found in the <strong>Enemy in Shadows Companion</strong>.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[LsUklap1rbMtM7RO]{The Place of Shining Rock}</p>\n<h4>Witch Hunters</h4>\n<p>With reports of anti-Sigmarite violence on the rise in Middenland, the witch hunters of various Sigmarite orders are particularly active on the road, questioning refugees and hunting for the Sons of Ulric and other miscreants. As the Characters learn along the way, one group of witch hunters was recently active in Middenheim, where they burned 17 accused cultists.</p>\n<p>A mounted band of witch hunters might have set up a roadblock, stopping traffic in both directions and questioning all aboard. This might be uncomfortable for any Characters who do not worship Sigmar, as well as for those who do so quietly, with no outward display of Sigmarite emblems such as hammer pendants. Of course, the very things that may convince Sigmarite witch hunters of a Character’s innocence also ensure that an encounter with the Sons of Ulric is far from pleasant.</p>\n<h4>Road Wardens</h4>\n<p>With so much lawlessness on the road, the Imperial Road Wardens are active too. They are patrolling more frequently and in greater numbers, and the Characters and their companions might be stopped anywhere along the road or questioned at an inn where they have stopped for the night.</p>\n<p>The Characters may have to convince the Road Wardens that they are innocent travellers engaged on legitimate business — but given the increase in traffic bound to Middenheim’s Carnival, and their cargo addressed to a recipient in the city by a reputable and well-known mercantile house, this should not be terribly difficult.</p>\n<p>A more serious problem may arise if the Characters run into a press gang. It is well known that both the Road Wardens and the River Patrol have been recruiting aggressively in recent months, and an inn is the perfect spot for a less-than-honest recruiting ploy known as ‘<em>The Emperor’s Shilling</em>’. While his fellows engage the Characters in conversation  — being careful to find out their names and home towns — one Road Warden slips a shilling into each of their ale-mugs. If they drink, they are held to have accepted the shilling — and therefore the Emperor’s offer of employment — under an ancient law. Whether they like it or not, they are now Road Wardens and can be taken into the service by force, if necessary. Some taverns provide tankards with glass bottoms, so that a customer can check for coins before drinking, but understandably the press gangs avoid such establishments.</p>\n<p>If they find themselves ‘impressed’, as the process is called, the Characters have chances to escape, but the Road Wardens already have their names and home towns, which can be circulated around the service on a list of deserters.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/refugees.webp","folder":"tp4QvOHx22sG8xK2","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":300000}}}

{"_id":"LsUklap1rbMtM7RO","name":"The Place of Shining Rock","content":"<p>Players who are familiar with ‘Carrion up the Reik’ in the Hogshead edition of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> may be expecting to visit this fabled temple, and help save the Grand Theogonist himself from an assassination attempt by the Sons of Ulric. If so, they are going to be disappointed.</p>\n<p>The shrine is off the road, and the coach only stops there by request: it takes an hour to walk from the highway to the shrine. If they stop there it may be a day or more before they can get a coach to Middenheim. With an urgent package to deliver, their schedule simply does not give them the time.</p>\n<p>The GM can drop a hint that things are different this time. The coach suddenly pulls off to the side of the road to allow a double column of mounted knights to pass, headed for Altdorf. They bear the insignia of the Sigmarite Order of the Fiery Heart. A very grand coach bearing the insignia of the cult of Sigmar and the personal arms of the Grand Theogonist is in their midst. The procession speeds by, and no one is interested in talking to other travellers.</p>\n<p>At their next stop, the Characters may hear the inn staff and fellow guests talking excitedly about the Grand Theogonist, whose retinue took over the inn the previous night.

One blow shattered it, leaving a long, wickedly sharp shard in the god’s hand: with it, he killed five hundred enemies before they fled.

{"_id":"MKeb88CBQN7kmMIp","name":"Initial Inquiries: The Purple Hand","content":"<p>If the Characters survive the initial ambush by Purple Hand cultists (see @JournalEntry[ggeBjJcnBuIzFcGw]{‘A Purple Hand Welcome’}), there are no further organised attacks: once the Carnival starts, the cult’s leadership is preoccupied with the plot to take over Middenheim. Even so, there is always a chance that, at some point during the adventure, a Purple Hand cultist may recognise ‘Lieberung’. There is a moment of eye contact; a startled expression; perhaps a hand signal, different from any the Characters have seen before and meaning ‘report to the leaders’ — and then the cultist tries to melt into the crowd. The Characters may try to follow or capture this individual (see @JournalEntry[BRFG82wEhR3OCLzW]{‘Crowds’}), but this will not be an easy task.</p>\n<p>If the Characters succeed, they may learn the location of a Purple Hand safe house, and possibly capture one or two cultists — but these will be low-ranking individuals who know only the three or four fellow members of their cell, and the fact that they have been ordered to cease all other activity — including the effort to recover ‘Lieberung’ — and concentrate their efforts on increasing popular support for the new taxes.</p>\n<p>At the GM’s option, a captured cultist can fill in a few details that the Characters missed from earlier adventures: Lieberung’s high rank within the cult, his promise to hand over the inheritance, and the meanings of any cult signs that the Characters may ask about. </p>\n<p>However, the rank and file does not know that Wasmeier is one of their own — one of their leaders in fact — nor any details of his plot beyond the fact that the new taxes are very important to the cult’s leaders.</p>\n<p>Low-level cultists  do not know the name @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard von Wittgenstein}, but they may know that a Slaanesh cult is active in the city. An exceptionally well informed cultist may know that this cult is called the Jade Sceptre, and that it recruits mainly among the city’s idle and wealthy youth. The two cults are rivals but not enemies, and have taken no overt action against each other: the Jade Sceptre seeks only pleasure, while the Purple Hand seeks power, and already has members in high places — although their identities are not known to the cult’s rank and file.</p>\n<h3>Something Big</h3>\n<p>One unexpected result of interrogating a captured cultist might be the news that the Magister Magistri, the cult’s supreme leader, has ordered all operations to stop during Carnival week: this includes the capture of Kastor Lieberung.</p>\n<p>No one knows why — it is not for the rank and file to question the Magister’s orders — but there have been rumours within the cult that something very big is planned. The captured cultist’s whole cell was ordered to keep a low profile until further orders, and do nothing except to continue supporting the new taxes as vocally as they can. Note: this has been a general order since the taxes were first proposed a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>This revelation may lead the Characters to suspect that the Purple Hand is behind the new taxes somehow, and even that the taxes play a role in the mysterious ‘big plan’ that comes to fruition during Carnival week. This should motivate them to start investigating the taxes (see @JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{‘The Taxes’}).</p>\n<p>Enterprising players may go further, and decide that any vocal supporter of the taxes is a potential Purple Hand cultist. If the Characters are careful, and look for purple items of clothing to help confirm their suspicions, they may be able to capture a few more low-ranking cultists, but they won’t be able to add anything to what the Characters already know.</p>\n<p>Of course, not everyone who vocally supports the new taxes is a cultist, and incautious Characters may discover that they have captured various other kinds of people, and possibly brought other forms of trouble on themselves. Innocent Middenheimers won’t hesitate to go to the Watch with a complaint if they escape or are freed; clerks and scribes from the Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation will do likewise, and the news of their ordeal will also reach the ears of Gotthard Wallenstein (see below), who will plot reprisals; Sons of Ulric are likely to return with a large number of muscular and determined friends to teach the out-of-towners a potentially fatal lesson; and so on. After a few problematic incidents, the Players probably decide that the best way to track down the Purple Hand is by investigating the taxes themselves.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE KASTOR LIEBERUNG GAMBIT</em></h3>\n<p><em>By now, the Characters have had plenty of time to develop a deep-seated enmity with the Purple Hand. If the Character who resembles Kastor Leiberung is still alive, they in particular are likely to have suffered from this association with the Magister. However, while this resemblance was a liability throughout Enemy in Shadows and Death on the Reik, the city of Middenheim presents opportunities for cunning Characters to turn this resemblance to their advantage.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Purple Hand’s organisation (see @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.fKu8IQpLRGcrqtvR]{The Purple Hand}) is obtuse, convoluted, riven with internal machinations, and in some places outright contradictory — all of which pleases Tzeentch greatly. This is something that could work to the Characters’ benefit. The Purple Hand makes an attempt to capture or kill them on their arrival in Middenheim, though during the Carnival most Purple Hand activities will cease, but the cultists will still be encountered either due to the Characters tracking them down, or if the cult sends assassins after the Characters if they become too close to unravelling their plans during Carnival week.</em></p>\n<p><em>One plausible approach for ‘Kastor’ to take would be to convince some of Middenheim’s cultists that, in fact, the bounty put on Kastor Lieberung was related to internal politicking within the Purple Hand, perhaps due to a dispute between the cults leaders in Nuln with those in Middenheim. Most of the cultists are not aware of the grand plan, so this doesn’t risk unravelling the entire plot prematurely. A particularly persuasive ‘Kastor’ may be able to talk some low-level cultists into lending aid, especially if they have had the opportunity to learn some of the cult’s hand signals and terminology. Some prolonged interviews with the cultists might even justify a Character being given the opportunity to take the Talent @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (The Purple Hand)} as though it were a part of their current career. </em></p>\n<p><em>How could the players make use of this? Well, The Purple Hand may well have been monitoring their rivals in The Jade Sceptre, and could possibly guide the Characters in the direction of Gottard Wallenstein. While The Purple Hand does not have any agents close to the Graf who have not already been named, they may well have some lower-ranking members in the palace’s general staff. These could be used to gain access to certain restricted areas, to acquire funds or blackmail material, or even to tip the Characters off to ‘Frau Kenner’ (see @JournalEntry[jepWFu96Qh64OlHw]{The Traitor Unmasked}) and her supply of Ranald's Delight to the Chancellor. They may even provide some muscle on occasion, though the cult’s methods are such that this should make many Characters uncomfortable. It is important, of course, that none of these agents know of Wasmeier’s real identity — you should take care not to tie the cult to him in any way. </em></p>\n<p><em>Should this occur, be sure to reinforce the distasteful realities of the Characters counting cultists among their allies. There should be plenty of mentions of terrible acts carried out in the past in Tzeentch’s name, and the hope of similar things happening in the future — and, of course, they’ll be looking forward to Kastor being there to join in, as well.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE HEIGHT OF FASHION</em></h3>\n<p><em>As the Characters navigate the highs and lows of Middenheim society, they are certain to be on the lookout for The Purple Hand’s signature fashion choice — that of wearing a single item of purple clothing. This ensures that  all cultists  recognise each other in public. Of course, not everyone who likes a purple hat, indigo coin pouch or raspberry sash is a cultist, so this is an excellent opportunity to play on your Characters’ paranoia. Anytime you need to describe an NPC’s appearance, use the table below to generate a random item of purple clothing if you wish to sow a little unease.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">@Table[purple-hand-clothing]</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"Ve1StDqEHdnywAsd","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 4: Initial Inquiries","sort":200000}}}

From at least 2510 IC (two years before the start of the campaign), Blitzen had been carrying on a correspondence on the subject of Skaven with a Doctor Felix Liebkosen of Rugebrunnen in Middenland.

As an Elector and the head of the Empire’s second largest religion, any mishap which befalls him will have far-reaching consequences. The Graf feels that Ar-Ulric is too concerned with the cult in the Empire and his Electoral position, and neglects Middenheim’s interests.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Ar-Ulric lives in the Inner Palace, and divides his time between there and the @JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{Temple of Ulric}. He also attends many different Carnival events.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Females</strong>:  –10 to all Fellowship Tests. He is anxious and tries to avoid women.</p>\n<p><strong>Priests of Ulric</strong>: +5 to all Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Ar-Ulric knows who influences Graf Boris. He can provide introductions to other NPCs, subject to his relations with them. He believes that only someone powerful would try to blackmail an Elector, but he is too fearful to try to unmask the blackmailer.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>None. Ar-Ulric knows who has the ear of Graf Boris.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Ar-Ulric desperately wants to recover his love letters: if they are returned he will end his affair with @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}, although he still loves her. He is very unhappy about the Temple Tax, feels that the Dwarf Tax is socially divisive, and believes the Scroll Tax will undermine a crucial element of the city’s defence. Forced to defend all the taxes, he does so unconvincingly.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Thinks him cold, aloof, and uncaring, especially about the social effects of taxation. To some extent, this is a projection of his own guilt at being forced to support the tax changes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Hardly knows him, but is aware of his good reputation. They might become friends if they got to know each other.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Hardly knows him, but admires his music. Has no idea that Rallane knows of his affair with Emmanuelle Schlagen, and would be terrified if he found out.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘Princess’:</strong> Doting fondness: she seems responsive to his homilies, and shows a kindly soul.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: Rather intimidating: she is too strict and unforgiving, especially toward the young.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Does not know them.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}:</strong> Neutral: their paths rarely cross.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: For the record, she seduced him. Initially head-over-heels, anxiety is tormenting him now. He still loves her, and would never betray her.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Wonders what they know or suspect. @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle} has told him that she suspects Petra Liebkosen knows about their affair: is she in league with the blackmailer?</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: It is good to see someone as dutiful and ardent, even if he is a pompous fool underneath. Ar-Ulric will neither deride nor defend him, except against the worst insults.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: No dealings: thinks vaguely of him as a good fellow, but knows his high-living reputation.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Has met him briefly and instinctively distrusts him, but in his current turmoil he hardly trusts his instincts any more. Wonders if he might be the blackmailer.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Ar-Ulric and other priests attempted to minister to @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan}, without success: Luigi’s success arouses mixed feelings. Fears that Luigi, with his huge and shameless appetites, might recognise something in Ar-Ulric and guess about the affair. Tries to avoid him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Ar-Ulric knew the introverted Reiner Ehrlich as well as anyone could. If he were not concerned with other matters, he might visit the Law Lord and try to help him with his acute depression.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>While Breugal has never shown the High Priest anything less than the proper respect due to his station, an increasingly guilty conscience has made Ar-Ulric sour and distrustful of the chamberlain. He sees contempt in Breugal’s every gaze and accusation in his every word, completely without justification.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Ar-Ulric doesn’t like Mueller but tolerates her. He finds her offhand manner and her elusive, lawyerly expression as evidence that she’s too clever for her own good. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>He respects her quiet resolve and values her role in the city, even though some of the other Ulrican priests dismiss her as soft. Her recent hostility towards him has proved unsettling.</p>\n<h3>Deadly Secret: Blackmail</h3>\n<p>Obviously, Ar-Ulric will be extremely reluctant to discuss the affair. The Characters must be gentle and subtle, unless they have somehow already managed to recover the letters. Otherwise, Ar-Ulric will be desperate to prevent the Characters learning of his indiscretions; for example, he may try to sidetrack them by saying that @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Wallenstein} is corrupt and should be investigated.</p>\n<p>Very careful and diplomatic play will be required to overcome his fears and build trust; depending on how the Characters approach him, he may let things slip little by little, or he may break down dramatically, confess all, and beg the Characters to help him.</p>\n<p>Ar-Ulric’s affair with @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} began about eight months ago. Two months ago, he received a letter from someone claiming to have his love letters to her. Unfortunately, he destroyed this letter, so the Characters cannot see it — but it contained certain intimate details that could only have come from the letters.</p>\n<p>The next day, one Frau Elise Kaltblutig requested an audience. She showed him one of the letters, and threatened him with scandal and disgrace unless he supported the new taxes. She was somewhat tall (5’ 6” to 5’ 9”); her hooded cloak concealed her build and face, and her speech was stilted, as though she was trying to disguise her true voice. After the taxes took effect, the woman visited again, telling him that the letters would be returned in two months provided he supported the tax changes until then. Elise Kaltblutig is one of @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich’s} many alter egos.</p>\n<p>The Palace guards have no recollection of visitors from so long ago: however, one of them, Josef Gropius, may remember a woman whose name began with ‘K’ — actually Brunhilde Klaglich using another alias, ‘Frau Kenner’ delivering the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor’s} favourite concoction.</p>\n<p>If the Characters recover the letters, Ar-Ulric will help them in their eventual audience with Graf Boris. Until then, he will help as best he can in other ways, such as providing healing and introductions to other major NPCs. His position and official duties do not permit him to accompany them in public, and he will literally swear the Characters to silence by having them take a sacred oath in the @JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{Temple of Ulric}</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Recitals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Horse Fair}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Elven Lightsingers}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/jarrick-valgeir.webp","folder":"So1PdVn4b7FXXZLo","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa","name":"The Village of Pritzstock","content":"<p>Pritzstock is a small but wealthy village of 60 or so adults and children. @Scene[9qBXM8BnsfoP9zEh]{Midddenheim Surrounds} details the local area and @Scene[4Kq88YbabEliQ7Tf]{Pritzstock} shows the village proper. In addition to a farmhouse, each household has a large fermenting shed where workers press grapes and store wine casks. Bottles of the better vintages are usually kept in cellars beneath the houses.</p>\n<p>Livestock is limited to a few pigs, goats, and hens. The latter are allowed to wander freely and spend a lot of their time scratching around the northwest area of the village, since this is where people are buried and the worms grow fat as a result.</p>\n<p>Surrounding the village are vineyards grown on manufactured terraces cleared from the forest; the wine produced provides the sole source of income for the inhabitants. Pritzstock wine has a light, delicate flavour, and is gaining in popularity throughout the Western Empire. In recent years, harvests have been particularly good, and the village has prospered as a result — buildings and carts are in good repair, animals are sturdy, and the people are well fed. </p>\n<p>Surprisingly to some, the village does not have an inn: Pritzstock’s social life takes the form of frequent wine tastings at one house or another. By far the most popular sessions take place at the home of @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe Rocheteau}, the burgomeister.</p>\n<p>The village is at its busiest during the grape harvest, and the timing of this is crucial to the village’s continued prosperity. The grapes must be picked within the next week to produce the best wine. Judging just when to start requires years of experience, and the Characters arrive just two days before the harvest of this year’s crop must begin if the wine is not to be ruined. Migrant workers from the surrounding areas have yet to arrive but some wine merchants from Middenheim and even Altdorf have already visited: the grapes have been assessed, and prospects look good — provided the harvest starts on time.</p>\n<h3>Arriving in Pritzstock</h3>\n<p>The rough track from @JournalEntry[EgezB9BzxKmohox9]{Grubentreich} emerges from the forest to reveal a small valley, intensively cultivated with acre upon acre of healthy-looking vines. If the party is travelling with Hans Krug, they hear a grunt of surprise. It is curious, he says, that nobody is working the vineyards.</p>\n<p>Arriving in the village across a well-maintained but rather inadequate defensive ditch, the Characters might be struck by Pritzstock’s obvious prosperity. A couple of houses have planks nailed across the windows, and large sprays of flowers fixed to the front doors. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Folklore) </strong>Test reveals they are ‘nanny’s fingers’, a local weed thought to ward off evil spirits.</p>\n<p>Following the sound of a hubbub in the distance, the Characters find that all the villagers are meeting outside the house of @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe}. The scene is quite confusing, with many people speaking and shouting at once. Things quiet down when the strangers are spotted, but at this stage the villagers are wary of newcomers, and act accordingly.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of the lull, @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Philippe} speaks.<em> ‘Look, there’s no point arguing until we’ve all calmed down and can talk sensibly, and there’s no sense blaming people without cause.’</em> At this there is a general murmur of dissent, but Henri-Phillippe continues. ‘Everyone go home, and we’ll meet again in a couple of hours.’ This is met with broad approval and the villagers begin to disperse. If the Characters arrived with Krug, the farmer and his two companions continue on their way after a stop at the local store to find out what’s going on.</p>\n<p>Once the meeting is concluded, @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} greets the Characters.</p>\n<h3>Recent Events</h3>\n<p>A day ago a boy named Seel Baldurich came running into the village having seen ‘a ghost’ in the woods (see Sighting 1 on the @Scene[xCHI2UlFpaaUOflT]{Pritzstock Sightings} map. Seel is well known in the village for his tall tales, and this one was put down to imagination. However, a few hours later, Isolde Gudhoffen was out collecting fruit when she noticed a skull sitting on a branch. The skull did not move, but when she returned with volunteers from the militia, the skull had gone (Sighting 2). Again, no one believed her. However, the previous evening two farm workers, Sigismund Halsbret and Knud Grapenpikker, both claimed to have seen a ‘glowing skull’ floating in the woods while out working (Sighting 3). This report was taken seriously, but a full-scale search by the militia failed to reveal any clues.</p>\n<p>Finally, on the morning the Characters arrived, Erietta Surhardt was attacked while working among the vines. Three other workers heard her scream and rushed over to discover her unconscious and bleeding. Worse still, a skull was resting on her body (Sighting 4). The skull took to the air and flew off into the forest. Erietta was carried back and now lies in the Rocheteau house, attended by @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet}. <strong>Note</strong>: If the Characters delayed coming to Pritzstock, feel free to change these exact timings, making sure to keep the relative time between each the same.</p>\n<p>An already frightened village had gathered to ‘do something’ when it was noted that Sigismund Halsbret (one of the witnesses in Sighting 3), was missing. A search of the village has failed to find him, unnerving the villagers further. (Actually, a very scared Sigismund left secretly before dawn. He has no relatives in the village and decided to pack his bags and run.) With the grape harvest due to begin in two days, the villagers are worried about their livelihood: they are frightened to go into the vineyards, and the crop is in danger.</p>\n<p>All the above is common knowledge, but the Characters are likely to obtain a more coherent version from @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Philippe}. Speculation is rife in the village. Here are a few possible rumours, and the GM should feel free to add more.</p>\n<p>The graves of dead warriors from an ancient battle have been disturbed by clearing the forest. Local rumour, based on truth, has it that a Chaos horde from the Drakwald Forest was slain two centuries ago, <em>‘somewhere over to the southwest’</em>. Perhaps some were also slain near Pritzstock?</p>\n<p>The skulls have been sent as a punishment from the gods for not making proper sacrifice in respect of the recent excellent harvests.</p>\n<p>@Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} is somehow involved, scheming to buy everyone’s land cheaply when all the villagers have left or been killed. Who else has the capital to buy so much land?</p>\n<p>The last rumour is the blackest, and is only spoken if things are getting very bad — and if @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} isn’t around.</p>\n<p>The villagers are angry that the militia has not done anything to stop the skulls. Just what the militia (four farmers and a young well-to-do soldier) are supposed to do nobody says, but that does not stop them from complaining.</p>\n<p>Pritzstock has a lot to lose if the harvest does not go ahead on time, and welcomes the Characters as potential rescuers. @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Philippe} offers @Credit[8gc SPLIT]{8 GCs} if the party deals with the skulls before the harvest begins. For each harvest day lost, the reward is reduced by 1 GC. He believes that the skulls have indeed come from some disturbed battlefield, and wonders whether all that is needed is to seal up some tomb entrance to stop the skulls getting out. During their period of hire, the Characters receive free food and drink, and may sleep in the fermenting shed.</p>","img":null,"folder":"XPM9XriCft4SkXW7","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":400000}}}
{"_id":"ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs","name":"The Jade Sceptre","content":"<p>Cultists of Slaanesh are very different from the followers of Tzeentch. Where the Purple Hand concocts endlessly complex plans to place its agents in positions of power and the Red Crown recruits mutants and prepares for a future uprising, the followers of Slaanesh have little time for deep-laid plans. Instead, they seek the instant gratification of all desires and probe the limits of physical and psychological excess. Their appetites are endless and insatiable, and power takes a distant second place to pleasure.</p>\n<h2>SLAANESH, THE DARK PRINCE </h2>\n<p>The promise of Slaanesh is the promise of ultimate pleasures, and the cults of Slaanesh are most common in the great cities, where the bored and well-to-do seek new and interesting vices to excite their jaded palates. Their interests span every possible appetite and pleasure, from art and fine dining and physical pleasures. The Dark Prince is not interested in mundane satisfaction however, but in the pursuit of pleasure through pain and excess. While most Witch Hunters look to the bordellos when hunting Slaaneshi cultists, an equal number can be found in the homes of the noble and the wealthy, where private parties behind closed doors have been known to take any number of disturbing turns.</p>\n<p>While the worship of Slaanesh presents an unquestionable threat to public morals, the followers of the Dark Prince do not generally seek the overthrow of the Empire, and cults like the Jade Sceptre tend not to be pursued with such vigour as those that clearly endanger the state. Indeed the status quo provides endless opportunities to cultists of Slaanesh, and the dreary pace of typical life in the Empire has driven many into their dark embrace.</p>\n<p>The followers of Slaanesh are implacably opposed to those of Khorne. Followers of the Blood God kill for the sake of killing, never glorying in the excess of death or taking pleasure in the pain they inflict. For their part, followers of Khorne despise the soft and hedonistic devotees of Slaanesh. Relations with the cults of Tzeentch vary: the ambitious Tzeentchians have been known to use Slaaneshi cultists as distractions or patsies, although from time to time they will solicit their help in corrupting a powerful individual who can then be controlled by means of blackmail or addiction. Cultists of Slaanesh and Nurgle tend to ignore each other unless the operations of one cult constitute a clear threat to the interests of the other.</p>\n<h2>Organisation</h2>\n<p>According to some Witch Hunters, the Jade Sceptre is barely an organisation at all. The cult seems to consist of a large number of local cells, some of which maintain a loose and intermittent contact with each other, but no hint of an overall leadership or power structure has been uncovered.</p>\n<p>Worse, the name ‘Jade Sceptre’ has sometimes been adopted by a variety of pleasure-seeking organisations that are unconnected with the worship of Slaanesh and do not seem to understand the import of the name: it has become an umbrella term under which all manner of gourmands, dilettantes, and hedonists gather. The name has become a sign of devotion to unbridled pleasure and contempt for morality by those who do not know its place in the lore of Chaos.</p>\n<p>A true Jade Sceptre cell can consist of up to forty individuals, and like the cult itself, most cells have no particular structure. Some are led by cult wizards, others by the wealthiest and most powerful members, or those whose homes are most commonly used for meetings, and others still by those who have the greatest interest in managing the calendar of events.</p>\n<h3>Symbol</h3>\n<p>Most Jade Sceptre cells use the common symbol of Slaanesh in rituals and as a recognition symbol when dealing with members of other cells. Some cultists wear it as a tattoo while others paint it on to their skin for rituals.</p>\n<p>There is a ceremonial Jade Sceptre from which the cult purports to take its name and which is often used in their most sacred rites and initiations. It is carved from jade, encircled in writhing figures, and inflicts a terrible yet irrestible pain when grasped. Though almost certainly a source of great Chaotic corruption, it is greatly sought after by those who know of it. For a terrible price paid directly to Slaanesh themself, the Sceptre is said to be able to cure mutation. There are mutants among the Jade Sceptre however, so if there is any truth to the rumour then the price demanded by the Dark Prince must be high indeed.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>The cult of the Jade Sceptre actively recruits those of all Species who show a predilection for self-indulgence, especially those who are rich or noble. Cultists, in particular those with no visible mutations, are usually very active in the society of their home town or city, frequenting all the best parties, balls, and other entertainments.</p>\n<p>They go out of their way to befriend a likely recruit, assess their predilections, and promise even greater pleasures of the same type. This period of initial contact is sometimes referred to as the ‘courtship’, and it lasts until the potential recruit is so addicted to their vices, and so hungry for more, that they will do anything to gratify their desires. At this point, under the promise of levels of hedonistic abandon beyond anything the recruit has known, the new member is formally inducted into the cult.</p>\n<p>Forms of initiation vary: a few cells use set rituals accompanied by readings from forbidden tomes; some substitute a painful hazing followed by an indulgent feast; and still others eschew all semblance of ritual and welcome the new member with the wildest and most decadent party they can devise.</p>\n<p>Once established in a city, a cell of the Jade Sceptre devotes itself to corrupting public morals, especially at the upper levels of society. Nobles and governing burghers become more and more openly dissolute and spend less and less time on the necessary tasks of government, trade, and the law. The end goal seems to be to turn the whole town into a morass of self-indulgence, utterly lawless and without ready defences. The process has only been completed in a few cases, though, since a point is usually reached where suspicions are raised. Witch Hunters descend on the town, trying and burning a great many innocent people and the handful of cultists who did not flee at the first sign of danger.</p>\n<h2>The Enemy of My Enemy</h2>\n<p>The role of the Jade Sceptre may seem obvious — they are a Chaos cult dedicated to a Ruinous Power, and the natural enemy of the Characters and most citizens of the Empire. However, their role in Power Behind the Throne is more nuanced. While they may act as antagonists, especially if the Characters find themselves chasing @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} or pursuing @JournalEntry[eZNUTrVGtnRXtKUx]{The Wine of Madness}, the Characters may just as easily find common cause with the cult.</p>\n<p>Though not as naturally opposed to Tzeentchian cults as followers of Nurgle, the Jade Scepter and The Purple Hand are often at odds. They compete for much the same resources — both recruiting impressionable nobility, albeit for different reasons. Additionally, the Purple Hand's plans for Middenheim  would see it ultimately fall to Chaos. While technically this is a favourable outcome for the Jade Scepter, in practice many of its members are far too enamored by the lifestyle they currently enjoy in the city to wish to see it fall too suddenly.</p>\n<p>If the Characters capture Gotthard alive, he will offer almost anything for his freedom, including the services of the Jade Scepter. He has influence over the cult, which has members throughout Middenheim. They could be useful spies, and provide some magical muscle if the players find themselves outmatched by a Purple Hand Magus or other agents of Wasmiere. </p>\n<p>Of course, any such alliance would be incredibly uneasy, morally fraught, and the Jade Sceptre are almost certain to betray the Characters in as excessive and painful a manner as possible just as soon as the opportunity presents itself.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>NEW TALENTS</em></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">The following Talents are sometimes granted to followers of Slaanesh.

{"_id":"OonygGgl5dY8QeHA","name":"Hausmeister Breugal - The Chamberlain","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/hausmeister-breugal.webp\" width=\"254\" height=\"288\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>The chamberlain is the Graf ’s head of household, and oversees all the staff in the palace. His is the final word on all domestic affairs and matters of protocol, and no event takes place in the palace without his direct involvement. He schedules all audiences, organises all dinners and receptions (including the annual @JournalEntry[vJmImfkNn1DONyrZ]{garden party}), and is in charge of hiring and firing servants and staff.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Breugal has a small but very neat suite of rooms in the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{Outer Palace}, and during Carnival week he never leaves the palace complex, overseeing every detail of the Graf ’s movements during that time as well as anything else that takes place there. If anything needs to be handled outside the palace — dealing with merchants and suppliers, for example — he either sends a member of his staff or summons the parties concerned to his office off the Graf ’s audience chamber. Even in his very rare free time (of which he has none in Carnival week), he does not frequent informal or lowbrow events, markets, or other ‘common’ locations.</p>\n<p>Reactions</p>\n<p>A Character of at least Gold 1 Status, or a lesser Character who can convincingly imitate these qualities, may be able to gain Breugal’s approval so long as they adhere to every scintilla of protocol. Anyone without @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (Noble)} is dismissed out of hand, and all others must make any necessary Fellowship Tests with a –20 penalty, such is the depth of his snobbery and devotion to ‘correct behaviour’.</p>\n<p>Knowledge</p>\n<p>Breugal knows much and suspects more, but says nothing. While he has the Graf ’s ear on domestic matters, he underestimates his influence, especially given the Graf ’s weakened condition. He refuses to listen to anything he considers ‘idle gossip’, anything vulgar, and anything that reflects poorly upon the Todbringer family or any of its members.</p>\n<p>While it is not impossible to get past Breugal and speak to the Graf directly, the chamberlain does everything in his not-inconsiderable power to prevent his master from being bothered, especially now. However, if the Characters can convince the chamberlain that the fate of the city or the life of the Graf are in danger — which is not easy — then he sends them to the major NPC whom he believes best placed to deal with the matter, writing a letter of introduction that urges the recipient to take them seriously.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Breugal has a very accurate idea of who influences Graf Boris, and how much. He underestimates his own influence, and overestimates that of the @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{Law Lords} and the @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Midden Marshals}, but only by a little. Otherwise, he is very rarely wrong.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Breugal’s only goal is to ensure the smooth running of the palace and its household so that all who see it are left in no doubt about the power and prestige of the Todbringer family. He ventures no opinions on politics, taxation, or anything else, regarding these matters as irrelevant to the true business of the palace, which is to be grand.</p>\n<h3>Breugal’s Role</h3>\n<p>Adding Breugal to <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> makes the adventure more challenging in a number of ways, and the GM should use him with care. If the Players enjoy roleplaying and NPC interaction — which are, after all, a major part of this adventure — he can add a great deal to the fun. On the other hand, if the party’s skills are more suited to combat than intrigue, the addition of another powerful NPC who requires careful handling may be too much.</p>\n<h4>Obstacle</h4>\n<p>As chamberlain to the Graf, Breugal oversees the running of the palace, and he can also control access to the Graf. Although he is only a slight physical threat in himself, he can call an almost unlimited number of Knights Panther and palace servants to deal with any riff-raff who threaten him or cause other kinds of trouble.</p>\n<p>Breugal’s default position toward anyone not of the court is one of disdain. Even high-ranking nobles from other cities, while accorded all the respect demanded by protocol and good manners, find that Breugal can be surprisingly effective in keeping unwanted visitors at bay. Those of lower social status find it even harder.</p>\n<p>Approaching Breugal is best through another NPC, whom he already knows and respects. If the Characters can make a good impression on him during an initial conversation (which is best done by expressing a devotion to the interests of the Graf and his city, while at the same time maintaining all the rules of etiquette and politeness), he might come around to their side and become a source of support rather than an obstacle. However, he helps in his own way, according to what he thinks is best (and most respectable, and in keeping with his idea of his office and its powers), which may not always be the kind of help that the Characters want or expect.</p>\n<h4>Influence</h4>\n<p>According to the system on @JournalEntry[BGdbAf7b92xpZpfg]{The Powers That Be}, Breugal has moderate influence (2 ‘votes’) over Graf Boris.</p>\n<p>Adding Breughal to the mix of NPCs raises the total number of ‘influence votes’ from 17 to 19, requiring the Characters to amass 10 ‘votes’ rather than 8 to ensure that the tax measures are rescinded.</p>\n<h3>Pressure Points</h3>\n<p>In concocting his plan (see @JournalEntry[efYPFvLrN0nHN2tq]{The Evil Plot}), the evil Law Lord and Purple Hand cultist @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier} has completely overlooked the influence of the chamberlain, and this gives the Characters a small advantage: an NPC who has not yet been compromised.</p>\n<p>Breugal has no obvious pressure points: indeed, he has been careful to avoid any circumstance that could compromise him and lead him to endanger the honour or the safety of the Todbringer family or their court. The Characters have to gain his support honestly and honourably, unless the GM decides otherwise and gives him a secret vice or some other weakness. <em>Hammers of Ulric</em> hints at a sadistic streak in his nature, which may reflect a greater interest in whipping underlings than discipline warrants, and it also suggests that he is a worshipper of Sigmar rather than Ulric, which could make his position increasingly uncomfortable in the growing religious tensions.</p>\n<h2>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</h2>\n<p>Like the NPC sheets in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, the sheet for Breugal gives his impressions of the other major NPCs, but to add him to the adventure, the GM must also know what they think of him.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: A polite but distant relationship. Breugal regards Sparsam’s role as necessary but rather sordid.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: Unfortunate that he is lowborn, for he has several admirable qualities: not least, in Breugal’s eyes, his loyalty to the Graf and his dignified presence when serving as his champion.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: Pretty, in both form and sound, but frivolous. Still, a court must have a minstrel. To Breugal, Rallane falls somewhere between an ornate tapestry and a vase of flowers.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: Though he would never admit it, and would be mortified at the suggestion, Breugal views Katarina with an almost fatherly affection. He expects to shed a discreet tear whenever she is married.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: A warm, if stiff and formal, relationship, based almost entirely on their shared prejudices and snobbery. Even so, they sometimes compete with each other over who can adhere more strictly to the most rigid and ancient codes of protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Breugal respects them and views them as a necessary projection of the Graf ’s power, but secretly he regrets that Baron Heinrich is not among them.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Magic, by its very nature, is based on breaking the rules that normally govern the behaviour of people and objects — Breugal instinctively distrusts it. He also fears that magical power will make wizards arrogant, and less respectful toward their aristocratic betters.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Breugal respects all the gods, deeming this correct behaviour, but is not especially devout. In fact, he rather distrusts those he considers ‘enthusiasts’ in the matter of religion. Still, the forms and rituals of worship appeal to him. He knows Ar-Ulric as a role, not as a person: to him, the robes matter more than the man wearing them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Breugal is courteously distant toward all of them, and so long as they bring no breath of scandal to the palace, he does not involve himself in their business. He knows that there is, or was, a relationship between Emmanuelle and the Graf, and suspects that her head has been turned by another: this leads him to be somewhat chilly toward her.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: Like a minstrel, a master of the hunt is a necessary member of an Electoral court, but Breugal sees Allavandrel in an abstract way, as more of a palace appurtenance than a person.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Breugal instinctively dislikes him, both for his personality and his money-grubbing way of life. This dislike is made all the stronger by Breugal’s belief that Gotthard is of noble blood but is hiding his true lineage, and by the looks Breugal has caught him casting in the direction of the ‘Princess’ and the other ladies.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: The Tilean appals Breugal in every fibre of his being, though he does reluctantly admit that he has been of some help to Baron Steffan.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Another necessary evil for the governance of the city, Breugal exchanged civilities with them when required but has never sought their acquaintance.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Breugal will not leave the palace grounds during the Carnival. He may be found at the Garden Party, but otherwise does not attend any Carnival events.</p>","folder":"udGynnL2hxddlr6Q","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":300000}}}
{"_id":"OpE7ByJyqUmLlrFv","name":"The Komission Convenor","content":"<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} is fairly easy to meet if the Characters seem influential or if one of them is an attractive female Elf or Human. While easy, the process  is not very pleasant, as Wallenstein is clearly only interested in what he can get out of any relationship with the party — especially money, power, or pleasure. He has no interest in helping anyone but himself, and although he tries to hide his naked self-interest behind a charming façade, he is not terribly good at it.</p>\n<p>Wallenstein can be seen at many of the Carnival events, but  is rude and dismissive of any Characters who do not appear to be of any use to him. If he sees an opportunity, though, he becomes friendly and even obsequious, in proportion to what he thinks the Characters can offer him. The party may have an opportunity to rescue him from some angry NPC whom he has swindled. If they find him somewhere secluded, they might rescue him from a small group of Skaven, in a kidnapping attempt that foreshadows a successful attempt at the conclusion of the adventure, prior to the events of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, the next part of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>.</p>\n<p>Wallenstein has nothing to offer the Characters in advancing the plot of this adventure, but if the players have realised that he is really the last of the Wittgensteins, they may use their inquiries as a cover to interrogate him subtly about his ancestor Dagmar von Wittgenstein, the missing warpstone, and the cult of @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{The Jade Sceptre}. You can decide how much free rein to allow the Players in these inquiries, as they constitute distraction from the main plot of the adventure, and may delay the Characters’ progress fatally. Ideally, the Players should become convinced that their first priority is to save the Graf and the city, and that Wallenstein/Wittgenstein can wait until later: they cannot know at this point that ‘later’ never comes.</p>\n<p>However, it may be possibly for the Characters to convince, blackmail, or otherwise cajole Wallenstein into helping them in other ways. The Komission Convener enjoys his positions in the city, and the Jade Sceptre immensely. The idea of the Purple Hand bringing a terrible wave of change to this pleasant state of affairs would distress him. Though good Sigmar-fearing Characters would undoubtedly have to hold their noses, Wallenstein/Wittgenstein and the cult of the Jade Sceptre more broadly may provide an ally of convenience during the Carnival. Of course, Wallenstein would undoubtedly plan to have the Characters disposed of just as soon as the more immediate threat had been dealt with.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Once he becomes convinced that the Characters have something to trade, Wallenstein makes extravagant claims about his position and influence in the city, promising to arrange personal interviews with everyone from the Graf to the chief rat catcher. In fact, he cannot deliver on any of these promises, since most of the major NPCs either dislike him, or are unaware of his existence. He always makes sure that he gets what he wants before attempting to keep his side of any bargain, and then starts actively avoiding the Characters. If he finds himself with no other choice, he pens a hasty letter of introduction which is either be rejected outright or imposes a –20 penalty to any <strong>Fellowship </strong>Tests that the Characters make in a first encounter with the letter’s addressee.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/gotthard-wallenstein.webp","folder":"IOqzzXGRK0YmZ3sY","sort":1400000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":1400000}}}

{"_id":"QagisQ5HY8IdO9T9","name":"Optional Events","content":"<p>The Characters have a schedule to keep, and should not let themselves become distracted or bogged down by events in the capital: if necessary, you should have a convenient Blucher agent appear and chivvy them along (see ‘Urgent Delivery,’ below). However, a couple of small but intriguing events should do no harm, and even advance the plot a little.</p>\n<h3>The Purple Hands-Off</h3>\n<p>This event can take place at any time while the party is in Altdorf. Perhaps the best locations are the docks and the coach depot: both are crowded places in which the Characters have other things to occupy their minds, such as handling the crate.</p>\n<p>On a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test, the Characters notice two men at the edge of the crowd, staring at them intently. They might even be the same cultists the party encountered on an earlier visit to Altdorf, if they are still alive. One has a purple feather in his hat, the other a leather belt pouch dyed mauve. Most Players realise that the two are agents of the Purple Hand, but if these clues go unnoticed, no matter: it makes this event all the more bewildering.</p>\n<p>As the Characters continue with their preparations, the two men look at each other, nod, and take a few purposeful strides toward the party. Then one puts a restraining hand on the other’s arm and gestures briefly toward the crate. They look at each other again, shrug, and turn around, melting into the crowd before the Characters can catch up to them.</p>\n<p>It is obvious that something about the crate led the two cultists to change their minds about confronting the Characters. A successful <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test reveals that the side facing the cultists is marked with the delivery address: Captain Scharlach, the Crossed Keys, Hoffen Strasse, Middenheim.</p>\n<p>If the Characters wish to talk to the cultists they have to pursue and apprehend them. The cultists attempt to escape, they have a head start of 3 and the same profiles as the @Actor[G3DW990j07OftQut]{cultists} in Middenheim. If the cultists are killed they are found to have a small tattoo of a purple hand on their left breast.</p>\n<p>If the cultists are subdued and questioned they seem rather bewildered as to the attitude of the person they believe to be Kastor Lieberung. One of them even goes so far as to say, “<em>Look, I don’t know what’s got into you recently Kastor, it’s been a concern to us, but if you’re on your way we’re willing to stay out of it.”</em> If Characters make appropriate noises about travelling to Middenheim, this draw an additional remark of ‘<em>seems like a bit of a waste, but so be it’</em>. If they are questioned beyond this they clam up and try to fight their way out of the situation. No further actions from the party persuade them to elaborate.</p>\n<p>The name and address on the crate are a Purple Hand code: as the Characters find out later, there is no Captain Scharlach. To cultists in Middenheim, the code means ‘These people have been sent to you, and they know nothing.’ To those along the way, it means ‘Let these people pass; they are being sent to others in the Order.’ The players have no way of knowing this, but they may already suspect that the party is being sent into a trap, and this strange event only serves to make them more uncomfortable. It should also serve as a hint that some answers to the puzzle that is The Purple Hand may lie in Middenheim.</p>\n<h3>Not Wanted</h3>\n<p>Also on a previous visit to Altdorf, the Characters @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.marbCRAizx1tjBQ3]{became persons of interest} in the deaths of two young nobles. However, this time they  see no wanted posters anywhere in the city, and if they ask about the case they may learn that the murderers — stevedores from a dockside tavern where the nobles and their bodyguards had made themselves unpopular — were caught and hanged some weeks ago.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/purple-hand.webp\" width=\"141\" height=\"206\" /></div>","folder":"tp4QvOHx22sG8xK2","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":200000}}}

Preparations for the Carnival are well under way as workers, swinging precariously from long ropes, attach bright banners to the dark-grey stone.</p>\n<p>Four stone viaducts wrap around the base of the rock, sloping gently up from the surrounding land. These viaducts, the Characters may learn, are each a mile long and 60 ft wide, with plenty of room to let carts pass in both directions. There is only a 3 ft stone wall to mark the outside edge, and especially on windy days, many cart drivers feel safer travelling in the middle of the road — which can lead to arguments. Pedestrians have the option of using one of two chair-lifts; the ride is spectacular and comparatively quick — but not for the faint of heart.</p>\n<h3>Welcome To Middenheim</h3>\n<p>If the party is arriving by coach or on horseback, a uniformed militiaman directs them to continue towards the viaduct. If the party is on foot the militiaman approaches, and says abruptly, ‘Viaduct or chair-lift?’</p>\n<p>The slightest delay in replying produces the retort, ‘Come on, come on. Never seen a city before? Do you want to enter by road or by chair-lift?’ This last sentence — especially the words in not in italic — is spoken slowly, in a very patronising manner. Once the party has replied it is directed towards the nearest chair-lift or viaduct as appropriate.</p>\n<p>At the start of each viaduct is a toll-gate. Local (recognised) farmers and those bearing the city’s coat of arms get in free; everyone else pays ‘a Crown a leg’. The chair-lift costs 1/– per passenger, plus 1/– to 20/– per item of luggage, depending on size. There are long queues before each main gate and at the chair-lift termini.</p>\n<p>Before the start of the Carnival, the party takes about an hour to reach the head of the queue, giving the opportunity for a couple of minor encounters to break the tedium and give the Characters a few snippets of information.</p>\n<h3>Rolfus Haffenvest</h3>\n<p>A wizard stalks away from the city, accompanied by a cart piled high with furniture and boxes. Clearly he is moving out of the city. If he spies any wizard type in the party, he approaches.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Middenheim!’ he spits. ‘Seat of learning, my thuribles! Take my advice and go elsewhere, unless you like paying good money for the privilege of existing!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rolfus is leaving the city after living there for ten years. If engaged in further conversation, he grumbles about the new Scroll Tax, blaming ‘<em>that miser Sparsam</em>’.</p>\n<h3>Hugnur Brimbeard</h3>\n<p>Any Dwarf in the party may be approached by Hugnur Brimbeard, who is accompanied by his wife and two young sons.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Take my advice and turn your back on this place,’ he says. ‘0 ’uns to the Carnival, and what happens? Soon as you get to the gate they charge you for the privilege of walking on their ground for the last 30 miles! Disgrace and insult, I call it. See that tower? My father built that tower! Well, we may have paid, but Brimbeards never stay where they’re abused and insulted.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hugnur is incensed at the Dwarf Tax and, although he has been forced to pay, he is leaving the city in protest.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>For Grognards: Tax Collection</em></h3>\n<p><em>Players who remember the first-edition version of Power Behind the Throne will expect to pay taxes on the way into the city. A cruel GM can use this knowledge against them. Some taxes are presented here, and others are covered in the box ‘Getting In’ bellow.</em></p>\n<p><em>Perhaps the taxes have not yet been fully implemented. The administration did not foresee, or plan for, the practical difficulties involved in stopping hundreds or thousands of visitors at the gates in the run-up to Carnival week, and at the insistence of Watch Commander Schutzmann — and much to the unspoken chagrin of Law Lord Wasmeier — all changes have been postponed until after the Carnival.</em></p>\n<p><em>Meanwhile, though, several enterprising locals are taking advantage of the flood of visitors — who have all heard of the new taxes and are expecting to have to pay them. Some may have set up official-looking roadblocks and toll stations on the road, and equipped themselves with quite official-looking credentials. Even if the taxes have not been postponed, someone might still be playing this trick: they might be simple criminals, or they might be supporters of the Sons of Ulric taking the opportunity to raise funds for that cause. There are angry scenes at the real tax assessment points as visitors protest that they have already paid, only to learn that they were duped — and that the road is outside the jurisdiction of the City Watch and local tax officials, neither of whom do anything about the false tax collectors.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>A Few Small Formalities</h3>\n<p>Eventually, the party reaches the head of the queue. At the gate or chair-lift they are assessed for tax by a gate-sergeant — who, they notice, also checks those leaving the city. The sergeant is backed up by enough guards to make most characters think twice about causing trouble.</p>\n<p>Dwarfs, and characters who are obviously wizards or priests are taken to one side. Everyone else who is not obviously a local peasant is asked: ‘<em>Are you now, or have you ever been, a wizard or a priest?’</em></p>\n<p>Those who answer ‘<em>yes</em>’ are sent to one side and are assessed for tax (@JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{The Taxes}). Those who answer ‘no’ are searched. Evidence of any spellcasting ability, including spell components and the like, means that the Character must pay the appropriate tax. If the Characters resist, they are arrested: they are stripped of cash and/or belongings to the value of the tax owing, plus a fine of several Gold Crowns (3-10 would be appropriate, as everyone assumes anyone trying to avoid the taxes  has money), and taken to the road, with a warning not to come back.</p>\n<p>Finally, those Dwarfs, wizards, and priests who have paid the tax are sent before a scribe who records their name, home town, date and time of entry, and general appearance before being admitted to the city. If the scribe is feeling generous, he or she may also give them a warning about the Old Quarter: ‘<em>Be warned that the south part of the east gate is frequented by criminals. Go there at your own risk.’</em></p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Getting In</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Veterans of the first edition Enemy Within campaign will probably expect to face bottlenecks and delays on the way into the city, which gives the GM the opportunity to surprise them. In a concession to the increased traffic in the build-up to Carnival week, the party is simply waved through, with the only formality being that their coachman must give the names of all his passengers, and where they boarded the coach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">The Characters may sigh with relief, thinking that they have saved a lot of time and a little money — but that is only half true. There are tax officials posted at every inn: they work in teams of two, and are accompanied Guards wearing the city’s insignia. Everyone is assessed, and taxes are levied, when they take a room in an inn. Names are checked against a list collected at the gates, for example, from coach drivers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Astute Players realise that this is a golden opportunity to try to evade the taxes by giving false names or simply looking for a place to stay that does not have a couple of tax officials waiting for newcomers. They are welcome to try: after many hours of walking around the city and some close calls — for there are inns where even tax men fear to tread, but these are just as dangerous (and unsanitary) for a group of out-of-towners — the Characters may decide that a bed for the night is worth paying taxes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">If they continue to try to evade the tax officials, though, they may notice a couple of familiar faces following them about town. Everywhere they go, these two are fighting through the crowds, trying to catch up with the party and even calling out the name of one of the characters. Page 60 has rules for conducting chases in the crowded city, which work as well for Characters trying to evade pursuit as they do for cultists and others trying to evade the Characters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Finally, after hours or days, the Characters find themselves in circumstances that make escape impossible: a dead-end alley or some other place in which they have no choice but to face their pursuers. Perhaps they are no more than dogged officials determined to do their duty, or perhaps they are more than they seem. They might be genuine tax officials — or at least, they might look like genuine tax officials — but rather than wanting money from the Characters, they have something valuable to give to them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Exactly what this might be is for the GM to determine, depending on what the Characters have been up to before they found themselves cornered, but it might be a valuable object, or it might be vital information relating to one of their lines of inquiry, or an invitation from a major NPC (which, as will be seen in the following chapters, is worth several times its weight in gold).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">The pursuers might even be loyal cultists of the Purple Hand, who want to welcome the Magister Impedimentae to Middenheim, and place the cult’s resources and safe houses at his (or her) disposal for the duration of the Carnival, since </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">the Magister Magistri is detained by an important </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">project and cannot give his colleague the welcome that </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">courtesy demands.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/chair-lifts.webp","folder":"tp4QvOHx22sG8xK2","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":500000}}}

If the Characters have made enemies already — or if some of the attending servants, who are greater snobs than their masters, decide that these upstart adventurers need to be taken down a peg or two — the Characters  might also have to contend with petty acts of sabotage such as drinks laced with pepper, subtle pushes and trips, and deliberately wrong advice on the way to make a good impression on a particular NPC.</em></p>\n<p><em>For players who enjoy social interaction, the Garden Party can be played out in full, filling an entire session of play.

She is as snobbish as the Players remember her, and absolutely refuses to allow members of the lower classes to sit in the same coach with her, or to keep her from a room that she clearly needs, when such riff-raff as the Characters can clearly make do with the common room or a gutter.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the tables could be turned: the Characters might rescue her from the wreck of a coach that has suffered an accident or an attack on the road.

Other threats include the militant @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{Sons of Ulric}, to whom Lady Isolde is unlikely to endear herself with her southern accent and high-handed attitude. Do not expect her to change her personality, though: she rewards the Characters for any help they give her, as befits a lady of her station, but once that transaction is complete — and she regards it as no more than a transaction — she sees no reason why anything should change between them.

They are consulted by Graf Boris and his other advisors on any matters in which magical skills may be important, especially to the security of the city.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>Leaders of the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Grand Guild of Wizards}, consulted by the Graf on all magical matters, especially relating to security.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Both magicians live in the Guild House, but Eberhauer also has a small town house in the select Ulricsmund district. Neither is married. Both attend some Carnival events, most notably the Black Pool Illuminations, which they are responsible for organising. Janna Eberhauer is notably more sociable than the High Wizard, and is easier to encounter about the city.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Wizards receive a +10 bonus to all tests based on Fellowship, except for apprentices and practitioners of forbidden magic.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>The magicians don’t have much to do with politics, although they do have a little influence with the Graf. Eberhauer is somewhat more worldly than Helseher, who is only now really waking up to matters of state; he has made angry representations to Graf Boris about the Scroll Tax. They know little of value to the Characters, but are sure that Law Lords Ehrlich and Hoflich must both have voted for the tax laws as the Guild's spyes at the palace have reported that Wasmeier vocally opposed them.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>The wizards think that both they and the Marshals have more influence on Graf Boris than they actually do, although Helseher is beginning to wonder about this given the imposition of the Scroll Tax and the lack of results to his furious but reasoned protests. Graf Boris seemed very sympathetic at the time, but someone must have changed his mind.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>The repeal of the Scroll Tax is a major priority, providing that it does not undermine the city’s security. If the Characters can credibly promise to do something about this specific tax (the magicians don’t care much about the others), they may win the wizards over. In any initial encounter, though, Helseher will give as little away as possible, while pumping the Characters for all the information he can get.</p>\n<p>Even the Characters befriend the wizards, they will not be lent or given any Guild resources, such as magic items or magical training: these are reserved for members, and there is a lengthy application and vetting process that cannot be circumvented. However, the wizards may agree to cast some minor spell (such as identifying a magic item) or perform some other trifling magical service on their own initiative.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Both suspect him of being behind the Scroll Tax. Helseher regards him as able, clever, but very detached (rather like himself, though Helseher does not see this). Janna Eberhauer is still seething about his unwelcome advances at their recent meeting; both will agree, if asked, that this behaviour was very much out of character.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: No dealings with him, although Eberhauer knows of his engagement to Kirsten Jung.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: No dealings, but Eberhauer (who is a moderate flautist) cares for his music and — unknown to the Minstrel — considers him rather attractive.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — the ‘Princess’</strong>: No dealings. They will talk vaguely about her, in an offhand way.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: No dealings, but Helseher will commend her many years of service to the Graf ’s family.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Infrequent meetings to discuss security. Helseher is pleased by their intelligence, but relationships are only professional.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Very few dealings. Helseher thinks him rather weak, Eberhauer disagrees and considers him wise and without malice. Both agree that he is fairly tolerant and decent. They have not seen him for some time, and know nothing of his affair or his anxieties.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ybdS4Z0pbWL8oiND]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Helseher knows nothing of any paramour, and cannot name any of the ladies. Eberhauer does not know which of them is involved with the Graf. Eberhauer sometimes meets Petra Liebkosen for a late-night cocktail at a good hostelry; they have become fair, if unlikely, friends. She has rarely met the others, but reasons that if @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — a very decent man — is engaged to Kirsten Jung, then Kirsten must be a good sort.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Both of them think he is an idiot.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Helseher knows nothing about him. Eberhauer knows his general reputation; she would like to meet him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: The magicians have no links with the world of commerce, and have heard no rumours about him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: They do not know him, and largely dismiss the rumours about him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: They like Wasmeier — a fellow wizard — but do not know Ehrlich or Hoflich. However, they blame them for the Scroll Tax. Wasmeier told them he was against it, but was overruled by the other two and dared not break ranks to oppose it openly.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer: </strong>Rothbert has several wizardly acquaintances at the Guild, who sometimes look to@JournalEntry[CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{‘The Man’} and his agents to source rare or illicit spell ingredients. Eberhauer knows him, but politely ignores him in public.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>High Wizard Albrecht Helseher despises Breugal, seeing a man with neither temporal nor magical power who struts and lords it over his betters. Deputy High Wizard Janna Eberhauer takes a more practical view, and regards the necessity of staying on the chamberlain’s good side in much the same light as she might regard the proper treatment of volatile alchemical ingredients.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>The Wizards know the High Priestess is the most sympathetic of the city’s priests and they appreciate having access to the excellent temple library. Helsheher likes Mueller and they have lively philosophical debates. Eberhauer is cordial, but has never warmed to Mueller’s personality.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>They’re glad she’s there, but have few dealings with the Shallyans.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<h4>Albrecht Helseher</h4>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>:<em> @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{A Knight’s Midsummer Dream}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Flying Displays}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Finale)}</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Janna Eberhauer</h4>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Gymnasts}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Recitals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Lightsingers}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Horse Fair}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Flying Displays}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants and Jousting}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>","folder":"So1PdVn4b7FXXZLo","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}

{"_id":"TtjfBS0C0YlVYZBW","name":"The Ritual","content":"<p>This adventure can be used as a diversion or a way to fill time when the Characters are in Middenheim. It pits the party against Skaven and their Human allies, and offers a good way to introduce the cultists of the Yellow Fang and the Skaven activity beneath the city.</p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>@Actor[XviXu9z4RMAv0tmo]{Grey Seer Skretth} is insane: a renegade Skaven with an impossible goal. He controls a small group of loyal but misguided Clan Skyre warriors. Recently, he and his group infiltrated the Undercity through a forgotten entrance that was not shown on any Skaven map — Skretth looks upon it as fate.</p>\n<p>The Grey Seer has become obsessed with Necromancy. He has even spent some time observing a Human Necromancer, but Skretth’s heavy use of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.5fowsr8vslorjeB2]{mandrake root} did not help his understanding of the experiments he witnessed. Instead, he formed a crazed theory: that the power of magic and the life-force were the same thing, and therefore that warpstone, as the greatest source of magic (in Skaven eyes, at least) holds the secret of life and death. Corollary to this theory was the proposition that the life-force of every living thing could be extracted from its body in the form of warpstone. He needs only to perfect the process.</p>\n<p>The prospect of an unlimited source of warpstone — and therefore, of an unlimited source of power — turned the Grey Seer’s brain. Amid visions of conquering the Skaven, and then the world, he set about a series of disturbed experiments intended to discover the process by which his theoretical goal might be achieved. The Undercity has provided him with an opportunity to collect specimens and practise rituals for his flawed quest. Human cultists in the town, members of the Skaven-worshipping Yellow Fang cult, are aiding Skretth in his mission.</p>\n<p>The adventure leads the Characters into the @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Undercity}. They discover that a band of Skaven has recently taken up residence there and, with the aid of Human servants, is carrying out bizarre rituals and sacrifices to the foul Skaven deity, the Horned Rat. The Characters must try to eradicate the Skaven, or at least drive them out, and save a wealthy citizen from their clutches in the process. The Skaven presence is significant, so the Characters will need their wits about them: repeatedly choosing to fight will lead to a swift and bloody demise!</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[asPugKqKMUhH3837]{Claw Mark}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[nPuUsRMfAFe2l6Ll]{Upstairs, Downstairs}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[7yPxqLqUFRNauqHG]{Into The Sewers}</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>TUNING THE CHALLENGE</em></h3>\n<p><em>By the time your Characters have reached Middenheim, they will have been through a lot, with experience and skills to match.

Pick the one which will present your group with an appropriate challenge. This is something that you will have to determine for yourself to some degree. There is no 'typical' WFRP group, and so creating one size fits all encounters can be difficult. A party might be all battle-hardened Soldiers, Witch Hunters and Knights, or it might be three Halfling Pedlars and a Human Graverobber who just wanted to get to the Schaffenfest.

Less important cult NPCs, or cultists you need to design in a hurry, can be created according to these notes.</p>\n<p>Most Jade Sceptre cultists fall into one of three categories: junior cultists, senior cultists, and cult wizards.</p>\n<h3>Junior Cultists</h3>\n<p>Use the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.jfMhkQGzjFWDxVOm]{Basic profiles} for Cultists. They all have the Skills @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Chaos)} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.skills.bVdhLdfuSAfMi3qq]{Secret Signs (Jade Sceptre)}.</p>\n<p>If the GM needs to create a junior cultist in more detail, add a day-to-day Career which is often drawn from the Academic, Burgher, or Courtier classes, with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.PJ4oxDExnuFNr2Fi]{Secret Identity} Talent. It is not unknown for bawds and other rogues to be followers of Slaanesh, though in many cases they are employed by cult members for their useful skills and contacts, but not formally inducted. Some cultists regard such types as ‘not our kind of people’, while many bawds, in particular, are wary of being accused of cult affiliation.</p>\n<p>A junior cultist also has a @Roll[1d100]{25%} chance of a mutation. If the junior cultist has a physical mutation, you can roll on the Slaanesh column of the @Table[expandedmutatephys]{mutation table} from <strong>Enemy in Shadows Companion</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Senior Cultists</h3>\n<p>Senior cultists are mostly Silver and Gold Status Academics, Burghers, and Courtiers.

{"_id":"UeS8v7lrTnfVSL0U","name":"Alfric Half-Nose - The Blackmailer","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/alfric-anvilbreaker.webp\" width=\"264\" height=\"238\" /></div>\n<h3>@Actor[D17cqCKU6D4AzdPI]{Alfric ‘Half-Nose’ Anvilbreaker}</h3>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>Alfric is a fence and information broker who provides a buffer between three important groups in Middenheim, the @JournalEntry[vcw9pxNsMoxkTbRV]{Low Kings}, the Dwarfs, and curious people who seek to find out about events in the criminal world without becoming embroiled in them. He has extensive black market connections, and trades secrets.</p>\n<p>Most rogues in Middenheim know about Alfric and can recommend him to anyone who is looking for information for sale. Alfric does not part with any information unless he gets something in return, which means he either wants gossip or money. Even letting Characters know that he does not know about something, or that the answer to their queries is merely ‘no’ costs [[/r 1d10]] Brass Pennies, and if they plump him for actual information this cost increases.</p>\n<p>Alfric trades information for information, but he does not accept idle gossip or obvious fabrications, it must be something that rings true and cannot be got just by listening to people in the street. If he realises he is being lied to he will happily sell his own lies back to the liar.  </p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Alfric uses the @JournalEntry[NUXlJY1IPwZJzDvO]{Bretonnian House Inn} in @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} as the base of his locations. It lies within the borders of the turf claimed by @JournalEntry[gy8z3RbyyEKaoJ2e]{Bleyden}, Lowest of the Low Kings. Bleyden offers Alfric a degree of protection, but is himself so besieged by his rivals that he cannot risk annoying the Dwarf by threatening him with censure, so Alfric is relatively free to let people know about criminal activity, for a price. The inn is fairly cheap and nasty, a stench of boiled cabbage clings to the place, but it is a marked step up from the Pit or the Drowned Rat. Alfric rarely leaves the inn (he sleeps in a small garret room on the upper floor).</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Alfric is resistant to Charm or Intimidate Tests, which suffer from a penalty of -1 SL. He does like bribes, so any Bribery Tests can be made with a +2 SL bonus (though they are something of a waste, Alfric can be bought in most circumstances and is quite open about it). Alfric does not let people Haggle him down, ever, he’d sooner starve.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Alfric knows a little bit about most of the controversies in Middenheim, however he has an understanding with the informer known as Josef (see @JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{The Taxes}), who sells high society secrets.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Like most Dwarfs in Middenheim Alfric reckons the influence of the Elves at court is behind the Dwarf Tax.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Alfric just wants to retain his position as a networker and seller of information. He does not like the Dwarf Tax, and supports its repeal, but he is too self-loathing to take it personally.</p>\n<h2>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</h2>\n<p>Alfric is all but unknown among the great and the good of Middenheim society, which suits the dwarf just fine, thank you. Those few who do know of him would never admit to it.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>In order not to step on Josef ’s toes Alfric will never volunteer information on individuals in high society. However, he can confirm suspicions for the price listed. Before Alfric sells anything about Middenheim’s courtly intrigues he suggests Josef as a source (and tells people how to find Josef for a charge of 6 schillings) but suggests that once they have spoken to Josef he might be able to add further juicy details, for a price.</p>\n<p>Josef reciprocates this relationship and suggests Alfric to the Characters if they are interested in information about Middenheim’s underworld.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsum} – Chancellor</strong>: Alfric knows that the chancellor is addicted to @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Laughing Powder}. He will confirm this for @Pay[4ss]{4 schillings}. He can also sell out @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl} as a local supplier, for @Pay[7ss]{7 schillings}. For @Pay[2ss]{2 schillings} he points out that he does not know who the go-between is, and that that is strange, as he knows most everyone who trades in such goods in the city. Alfric also knows about Josef ’s recent impertinence to Janna Erberhauer and Petra Liebkosen (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmeidehammer} – Champion</strong>: Alfric knows that Dieter’s behaviour changed recently and for @Pay[3ss]{3 schillings} he will agree that the symptoms look like those of a person who has been hypnotised. Alfric has met ‘Charlotte’. For a Gold Crown he admits that he has met her and provides a decent description highlighting her bright green eyes. He has not guessed that she is anyone’s alter ego. He does not say if they are due to meet again but a Character who passes a <strong>Very Hard (-30) Intuition </strong>Test might suspect that she and Alfric have met more than once.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Ralane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: Alfric is not particularly prejudiced against Elves but he has spent so much time around those who are that he believes Rallane to be behind the Dwarf Tax. This misleading opinion can be bought for @Pay[3ss]{3 schillings}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: Too hot to handle, tells anyone interested to talk to Josef.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: He does not sell information about her, but if he is asked if she is a relation of @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl}, and is paid @Pay[2ss]{2 schillings}, he says that it is not a lie.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: He can point out that Ulrich Schutzmann is a Sigmarite who regularly prays at the Temple of Sigmar in Middenheim for @Pay[6bp]{6 brass pennies}. <em>‘Hardly a secret but some might query his loyalty to Ulric’s holy city’</em>. He has nothing of interest to say about the other Midden Marshals.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Alfirc happens to know something<em> ‘a bit surprising about Janna Erberhauer’</em> but thinks Josef would prefer to sell it. Josef does not, so if Characters come back to Alfric he asks for @Pay[4ss]{4 schillings} and then relates that @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsum}, who is normally shy as a mouse with women, propositioned her rather rudely recently. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Tells anyone interested to talk to Josef.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: He leaves gossip about court to Josef, but can confirm Emmanuelle Schlagen’s status as paramour (@Pay[8ss]{8 schillings}) and the recent attempt by @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsum} to proposition Petra (@Pay[2ss]{2 schillings}). He can confirm gossip about @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulrc} and Emmanuelle, but only if the Charatcers spell it out, have already spoken to Josef about it, and pay @Pay[12ss]{12 schillings}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: Alfric knows little of Allavandrel but believes he helped @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} instigate the Dwarf Tax. This misleading opinion can be bought for @Pay[3ss]{3 schillings}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Alfric can relay that Gotthard is <em>‘a relatively recent arrival’ </em>(@Pay[2ss]{2 schillings}) who ‘earned his positions without a record of merit’ (@Pay[8ss]{8 schillings}).  </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: Alfric tells anyone interested to talk to Josef. Can suggest, if the subject of hypnosis is raised, that he knows an expert in the field who moves in court circles, and for @Pay[4ss]{4 schillings} he gives Luigi as a name. For another @Pay[3ss]{3 schillings} he explains that Luigi, for all his vices, does not mix with criminals. </p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Tells anyone interested to talk to Josef. He can confirm if asked that Erlich has been in depressed self-isolation recently (@Pay[3ss]{3 schillings}) and that Erlich’s support of the taxes is rather out of character (@Pay[5ss]{5 schillings}).</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Alfric is far too wrapped up in performative misanthropy to be seen enjoying himself, and eschews the carnival.</p>\n<h3>Handle With Care</h3>\n<p>There are a few things to consider when employing Alfric.</p>\n<p>Alfric plays a part in the fourth part of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong> campaign, <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. He should be used very sparingly in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, and whilst he might annoy the Characters, he should not anger them so much that they do away with him or ruin the chance to cooperate in future.</p>\n<p>Once every few weeks @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} disguises herself as ‘Charlotte’ and pays Alfric to inform her of any dealings within underworld society that might trouble her. She is next due to do this on the fifth day of Middenheim’s carnival. Unless the Characters adopt good disguises when speaking to Alfric he tells her what he knows of them. This may spur her to take action against them in turn.</p>","folder":"udGynnL2hxddlr6Q","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":400000}}}

Klaglich’s last act is to hand Reya over to a member of the Ordo Novitiae. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} and the @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Hoflich} Doppelgänger are enjoying the opera @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{<em>The Ring of the Nibble Unger</em>} Lied at the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music}. The performance is set to end at midnight, and by 12.30am the two men have returned to the Palace.</p>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} makes his way to his room, but @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Hoflich} goes to the Graf ’s chambers, and seeks an immediate audience. Despite the time, the Graf ’s personal guard would not think of denying entrance to one of the three Law Lords — especially Hoflich with his fearsome reputation. The Graf is, of course, alone, and his death is simple.</p>\n<p>At this stage, the creature will not assume the Graf ’s form. It opens a window and leaves — still as Hoflich — instructing the guards that the Graf does not wish to be disturbed for the next hour.</p>\n<p>Back in his apartment, the Hoflich Doppelgänger consumes a <em>Potion of Invisibility</em> supplied by Wasmeier and re-enters the Graf ’s rooms via the open window, using a rope and grapnel. @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{The Illuminations} distract the Outer Palace Guards’ attention.</p>\n<p>The Doppelgänger then take the Graf ’s form and, after the invisibility has worn off (which may take up to an hour), instructs the guards to fetch @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Law Lord Wasmeier}. The two celebrate their success, and watch the remainder of the fireworks from the south window. Wasmeier then pays a visit to Hoflich’s apartment before going home: this visit is just for show, to indicate that Hoflich is still in the Palace.</p>\n<p>Next morning, the Graf will surprise everyone by calling for a meeting of his advisors; all will attend apart from Hoflich. Not bothering to wait, the Graf will demand to know who was behind the taxes. @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} will expect many of the advisors to remain quiet, but he will speak out and name Hoflich.</p>\n<p>A second call will go out for the Law Lord, and when he cannot be found his Palace rooms are searched. The mouldering body of the real Law Lord is found, along with some incriminating evidence: the diagram of influence and the address of the pawns’ lair. There, evidence of Reya’s imprisonment and @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric’s} letters are found, and a ghastly plot may be deduced.</p>\n<p>From the way both Hoflich’s apartment and the lair have been left, it looks like the criminals vacated in a hurry. @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Law Lord Wasmeier} publicly blames himself for this: after his conversation with Graf Boris, he informed Hoflich that the Graf was against the taxes, and meant to repeal them.</p>\n<h3>Festag Night</h3>\n<p>Though they may not know it, the Characters are on a collision course with @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} plan.</p>\n<p>Despite their best efforts, even a very good party is unable to gain the open support of @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}, @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{the paramour}, or @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich} before Festag night. More importantly, the vital clue known only to Ehrlich — that it was @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Hoflich} who introduced the taxes and who threatened him — will not be revealed until the Law Lord’s niece is safe.</p>\n<p>So, while the Characters may have correctly deduced the various holds that the unknown villain has over each of the NPCs, they will only be able to do something about it on Festag night: either when they trail @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} to her lair, or intercept the delivery of letters and Reya Ehrlich. Both these events are timed to occur at about 11:30pm — about an hour before the @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppelgänger} is due to murder the Graf, which should be more than enough time to stop the plot.</p>\n<h4>A Clash with the Pawns</h4>\n<p>The first thing the Characters must do is deal with the pawns. If they hesitate, have some of them (but not Klaglich) leave the lair: the Characters will be forced to react to prevent them escaping. @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} can join the combat a few rounds later or, if the party splits up, have her in the lair trying to batter down the door to Reya’s prison cell: the mercenary Dagmar suspects that Reya  might be harmed rather than ransomed, and is attempting to prevent it.</p>\n<p>Optionally, one of the NPCs may escape. Then, the party must act before the NPC can get a warning to ‘The Boss'. They aren’t to know that the escaped NPC has no idea who ‘The Boss’ is.</p>\n<p>Having dealt with the pawns, the party should discover the love-letters and Reya; they will probably wish to visit one of the major NPCs involved. lf they wish to visit @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} first, Reya will demand to be taken to her uncle at once! Ar-Ulric is not attending any event and will be difficult to locate in any case.</p>\n<p>Nearly the whole of Middenheim will be out on the streets by now, as people make their way to the @JournalEntry[UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{Great Park} for the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Grand Finale} of fireworks and magic. Every minute counts as the Characters try and wade through the crowds. Eventually, the party arrives at @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich’s} house. He takes a minute or so to come to the door: more time wasted. At the sight of his niece, he bursts into tears of joy. </p>\n<p>‘Shallya and Sigmar be thanked!’ he cries; hugging Reya to him. He wipes away his tears with one hand, and still hugging his niece, he addresses the Characters. ‘It was Hoflich! He kidnapped Reya to force me to support his taxes! My friends, there is no time to lose! Watch, ho! Quickly!’</p>\n<h4>The Game is Afoot!</h4>\n<p>With his niece safe, @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich} is a different man. Calling the Watch to escort them all, he sets out with Reya and the Characters to confront Hoflich, and put the whole matter before the Graf.</p>\n<p>What happens next depends on whether the Characters have arrived at Ehrlich’s house before or after midnight. lf it is already past midnight, Ehrlich leads the party straight to @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{the Palace}; if not, he heads for the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music}, pointing out that Hoflich is an opera buff, and tonight is the last night of @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{<em>The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied</em>}. ‘If we hurry, we can take him before he knows that his plan has misfired! Come on!’</p>\n<p>Play the rush across the city to the full, consulting the city map. The players should feel the pressure of time mounting against them. Time each section of the journey, ask the players which route they are taking, and roll dice frequently. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘OK, you start off here, and the Royal College of Music is here (indicating map). Now, you could head down Fursten Allee and round the north side of the Great Park, or you could… that way? Right. To get from one end of Fursten Allee to the other should take you about three minutes (writes down ‘3,’ rolls dice, leafs through book). OK, it’s not too crowded, and people get out of the way as the Watchmen shout at them to do so (rolls dice and consults book again). Hmmm — it’s pretty crowded around the Park (rolls dice again). Looks like it will take you about six minutes just to get across the Garten Ring to the Ost Weg. Of course, you could head up Panther’s Parade and along Palast Strasse: it’s a longer route, but it might be less crowded…’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All this has no effect on the course of events, but it gives the players the feeling that they are racing against time building up the tension to the climax of the adventure.</p>\n<h4>The Royal College of Music</h4>\n<p>The party arrives at the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music} just as everyone is leaving. After a few minutes asking around, they discover that @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Law Lord Hoflich} has already set off to @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{the Palace} in a coach. They must now hurry back to the Palace, with more time wasted.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[16KsfNTgXYLtRib9]{The Middenpalaz}</h4>\n<p>Arriving at the Palace, the party learns that Hoflich arrived about 12.30 a.m. With Ehrlich’s authority, they are allowed access to the Inner Palace grounds. When they arrive at the Inner Palace proper, they learn that Hoflich went to see the Graf just a few minutes previously. If the party is running late, assume that Hoflich spent some time in his apartment after coming back from the opera.</p>\n<p>The Characters should begin to develop a very bad feeling. @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich} summons the duty officer of the Knights Panther, and explains that treachery is afoot.</p>\n<p>‘Law Lord Hoflich is a traitor!’ he cries. ‘Guard my niece here with your lives, and summon all the Graf ’s advisors immediately! And at all costs, make sure that Hoflich does not leave the Palace!’</p>\n<p>With that, he leads the party upstairs to the Graf ’s chambers, outside which they meet his personal guard of ten Knights Panther.</p>\n<p>‘Treachery!’ cries Ehrlich. ‘Hoflich is a traitor! I must speak to the Graf immediately!’ While the Knights are still thinking about this, he throws open the doors to the Graf ’s chambers, and stops in his tracks, his expression one of dumbfounded, slack-jawed amazement. In the middle of the room, two identical Grafs are locked in combat, one strangling the other from behind with a length of cord! Every character must make a successful <strong>Difficult (–10) Willpower</strong> Test or gain the @Condition[Surprised]{Surprised} condition.</p>\n<p>The real Graf is the one currently having the life squeezed out of him, and is only two rounds away from death.</p>\n<p>This is not a new situation for the Doppelgänger. It has been discovered during murder attempts in the past — its aim now will be to escape. It will release the pressure on its garrote, but keep a hold on the Graf, using him as a human shield. In his feeble, choked state the Graf is in no position to resist.</p>\n<p>The creature backs off towards the nearest southern room, threatening to finish off the Graf should anyone make a move. It opens the door with one hand, and then pushes the Graf forward and darts into the room, closing and bolting the door before anyone can reach it.</p>\n<p>If anyone makes a threatening move (including seeming to cast a spell), the Doppelgänger tightens the garrote, knowing that it has nothing to lose. In this case, only two rounds pass before the Graf of Middenheim collapses, apparently dead!</p>\n<p>In either case, the Characters are faced with a Graf who is close to death, and an identical imposter who is attempting to escape. Despite their enthusiasm for capturing the fake Graf, the Characters — or at least some of them — should attend to the real Graf Boris at once. Remember, he is not some peasant whose life is meaningless: he is an Imperial Elector with more money and influence than any Character could possibly imagine. </p>\n<p>Optionally, a successful use of any healing Spell or Skill by any Character or NPC will revive even a seemingly dead Graf.</p>\n<p>The Doppelgänger has a round in which to lock or bolt the door, and while it is being battered down (T 4, D 10), the creature makes its escape by jumping from a window into the gardens (5 yd).</p>\n<p>In the darkness, the @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppelgänger} returns to Hoflich’s form (aware that a Graf dressed in nightclothes will attract too much attention) and tries to leave the Palace, bluffing its way out if needed. Remember, at this stage it is only the Palace building guards who have been commanded to stop Hoflich: the gate guards have no such orders, and it is able to get through the gates in Hoflich’s form.</p>\n<p>If the creature is being chased and attacked by Characters, the guards will naturally side with the ‘Law Lord,’ until the Graf ’s personal guards — who saw the Doppelgänger — arrive to issue other instructions. Should the Doppelgänger be killed, it immediately returns to its true physical form.</p>\n<p>Things could be very confusing for a while, as different Palace guards side with various NPCs and Characters. Since the two Law Lords effectively cancel each other out, the deciding factor is the intervention of the Graf ’s personal guards. These are Knights Panther and are not (generally) stupid; they will realise that the fake Graf must have been whatever creature entered the room in the guise of Law Lord Hoflich.</p>\n<h4>After the Attack</h4>\n<p>Eventually the @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppelgänger} is either killed or captured, or it escapes into the vast Carnival crowds. Attention should then return to the Graf ’s chambers, where there is much activity. The rest of the Palace is stirring, too. Dozens of Knights Panther take up station all over the Inner Palace, with Graf Boris and his family being heavily guarded. The Palace grounds are extensively searched, and units dispatched to locate and fetch all high-level advisors — especially @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Baronial Physician Pavarotti}.</p>\n<p>During this time, the Characters are guarded until the Midden Marshals arrive and interview them; they are not allowed to go wandering around the Palace, and are certainly not allowed to leave. In part, this is for their own protection: without escort, the Characters are likely to be challenged by any group of guards they come across.</p>\n<p>The Marshals will demand a full explanation of events from the Knights and the Characters. Only then, provided they are satisfied by the Characters’ involvement, will they be treated as heroes rather than villains. By this time, all the major NPCs (bar @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}) will be in the Palace, and most will be confused.</p>\n<p>Given that the Characters can claim to have saved the Graf ’s life, this reaction may prove a little galling. However, orders are orders, and during periods of military crisis it is the senior officer on the scene that has full command. @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich} will vouch for the party, but his word does not count for everything. However, any information given by Ehrlich and the Characters will be thoroughly investigated.</p>\n<h4>A Grisly Discovery</h4>\n<p>When the Marshals have finished talking to the Characters, a Knight appears and talks quietly with @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Commander Schutzmann}. Schutzmann listens, nods, then turns to the party, saying ‘Come with me.’ They are led to Hoflich’s apartment, which shows signs of a thorough search.</p>\n<p>A trunk has been dragged into the middle of the room, and opened. It contains a waxed, sealed sack, now slit down the middle to reveal @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Joachim Hoflich’s} decomposed body!</p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} is given three pieces of paper, also found with the trunk. The largest (@JournalEntry[Handout 4]) shows a peculiar diagram. This is actually an overview of Wasmeier’s web of influence, designed to convince others of Hoflich’s treachery (outlined in ‘Wasmeier’s Plan’ above). </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/handout4.webp\" width=\"405\" height=\"405\" /></div>\n<p>The second (@JournalEntry[Handout 3]) bears the address of the pawns’ lair</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/handout3.webp\" width=\"311\" height=\"113\" /></div>\n<p>The final piece of paper is a handwritten note (@JournalEntry[Handout 2]), reading:</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/handout2.webp\" width=\"371\" height=\"138\" /></div>\n<p>This note, written by @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, was attached to Wasmeier’s own diagram of influence. The @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppelgänger} burned the original as instructed, but, having put the note aside, forgot all about it, and it fell behind the trunk. Obviously, the writer of the note was the fake Hoflich’s boss, which means he or she must be the real mastermind. All the Characters have to do is to find someone who recognises the handwriting — such as @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich}. It should prove quite entertaining as the Characters rush around the Palace asking people for copies of their handwriting! If the Characters fail to solve this problem, one of the Marshals will do so. In any event, recognition of the writing will produce a rush to Wasmeier’s apartment in the Palace.</p>\n<h4>Wasmeier Flees!</h4>\n<p>As outlined earlier, the evil Law Lord was waiting in his rooms for the Graf-Doppelgänger to summon him. His first knowledge of things going wrong is in the form of a Knight Panther appearing at his door to say that Law Lord Ehrlich requires his presence in the Graf ’s chambers, and that Law Lord Hoflich is accused of treachery.</p>\n<p>Dismissing the Knight, Wasmeier realises that his plan has failed. He consumes a <em>Potion of Invisibility</em> and casts @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.9wmmln3DunIqGXM2]{Flight} to leave undetected through a window. These were hidden in his apartment for just such a possibility.</p>\n<p>Thus, when the Characters arrive to deal out justice, they find the apartment empty.</p>\n<h4>Audience with the Graf</h4>\n<p>At the same time the Characters discover that the bird has flown, @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} has recovered enough to receive a briefing on recent events. He then sends for the Characters. They are admitted to the Graf ’s bedchamber, where the ruler of the city, despite his brush with death and his confinement to bed, will have some of his old spirit back.</p>\n<p>The @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess}’ and @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} will be close by his side, and all the influential NPCs (apart from @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} and @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle}) will also be present, along with his personal bodyguard of Knights Panther. The Ladies-at-Court, the @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Knight Eternal}, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel} and Goebbels will be waiting outside.</p>\n<p>The Graf addresses the party, somewhat sarcastically at first:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘My advisors tell me that you people, independent adventurers, seem to know more of what is going on than they do — so much so that you, rather than my Knights Panther, saved my life. For this I thank you, and you will be rewarded. Now I learn that the person responsible has fled the Palace, perhaps even the city. This cannot be borne: I command you to locate the traitor Wasmeier and bring his body back to me!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He waves one hand feebly, dismissing everyone except his daughter. The Characters will be praised by all major NPCs: the crisis seems to have done the Graf good. It looks like he has returned to his old self. Of course, there is still the matter of tracking Wasmeier down….</p>","folder":"NdV140BH3D9p6vpI","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 7: The Traitor Unmasked","sort":300000}}}

Shouting a prayer to Sigmar, the coachman drops the reins to cover his eyes, while the horses scream and rear in terror. As they bolt wildly to avoid the flying skull, the horses careen the coach against the trunk of a massive oak and the whole thing overturns, smashing both right-side wheels in the process.</p>\n<p>Anyone on the roof of the coach must make a Test against @Fear[2] in order to be able to do anything other than quiver with fright. A jump from the coach is treated as a distance of 3 yards. Hanging on to the coach requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Strength</strong> Test: success results in the Character taking a Damage 3 hit that ignores Armour, while failure means that the Character is flung clear and falls 3 yards. See @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.1gNxlCdPV1C3oZ6Z]{Leaping and Falling} for details on jumping and falling.</p>\n<p>Having had no warning, all those within the coach must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Agility</strong> Test to avoid taking a Damage 3 hit that ignores Armour. As the passengers begin to disentangle themselves, one of them (chosen at random) sees the skull heading west over the trees. See @Actor[FRS2PzhU3H98XfTX]{Flying Death Skulls} for a further description of the skull.</p>\n<p>The coach is beyond repair: only two wheels remain intact, and both axles are smashed. Hedric the coachman is lying in the road battered and bruised, but otherwise unhurt. Gunder, alas, suffered fatal injuries during the crash, when a trunk containing Elise’s ball gowns fell from the luggage rack and broke his neck. Two horses have run off, a third has a badly broken leg, and the other stands shivering nearby. The two girls are very upset but can be calmed by reassuring words. Hedric’s wide-eyed babble about the <em>‘swooping, red-eyed monster!’ </em>does little to help.</p>\n<h3>A Choice</h3>\n<p>The party has a number of options. They could stay put, but this would mean a night in the forest. Hedric points out that no other coach is due today, and in any case, would not stop for fear that the party was actually a gang of highwaymen. The next settlement of note on the route is Schöninghagen, but they could not reach it before nightfall. The obvious choice, and the one clearly favoured by Elise and Bertha, would be to walk back to the village of @JournalEntry[EgezB9BzxKmohox9]{Grubentreich}: the girls have relatives there who would put the Characters up for the night and see them safely to Schöninghagen the next day. If the Characters seem reluctant, the girls say that their relatives are sure to reward the brave adventurers for escorting them safely there.</p>\n<p>Hedric, a brave fellow who takes his duty seriously, declares that he has to ride the one remaining horse to Schöninghagen and inform the road wardens. He would not do so unless he is sure that the young ladies are safe in the Characters’ company, he says, but his duty is clear. The bulk of the luggage has to be left on the road (much to the passengers’ distress) and take its chances overnight: it can be recovered in the morning on the way to Schöninghagen.</p>\n<p>On foot, it takes an hour or so to reach @JournalEntry[EgezB9BzxKmohox9]{Grubentreich}. About half a mile outside the village, though, Bertha stumbles and twists her ankle. Any Character who successfully treats her with an <strong>Average (+20) Heal</strong> Test or carries her for the last half-mile wins her sincere gratitude, something which may prove useful during the events to come in Middenheim.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: WHY HERE?</em></h3>\n<p><em>Since the adventure’s first publication, it has been observed that the skull attack on the coach does not fit with the general pattern of skull activity, and does not advance the villain’s agenda at all: in fact, it leads to his ultimate downfall by bringing the Characters to the village. Experienced Players may wonder about this, even if they have not played ‘The Grapes of Wrath’ before, and if they manage to capture Gräber, they may question him on the matter.</em></p>\n<p><em>The fact is, it was a simple accident. He was testing the range of his control in an area far from the village where he did not expect to be disturbed, and a wasp flew down the neck of his jerkin. Distracted, he briefly lost control of the skull, which careened wildly out of the woods and across the road — and right into the path of the Characters’ coach.</em></p>\n<p><em>Gräber is embarrassed to admit this, though, since it is hardly the sort of mischance that should befall the great and dreaded @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gravelord}. </em></p>\n<p><em>Instead, he makes up some grandiose tale about recognising them from Altdorf and punishing them for killing his Carrion or whatever else they did to thwart him, but a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test leads the Characters to believe he is lying. Also, his hand strays unconsciously to the back of his neck as he speaks, and if the Characters examine the spot they will find an angry red welt, clearly caused by a wasp sting at about the time when their coach encountered the skull.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","img":null,"folder":"XPM9XriCft4SkXW7","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":200000}}}

She is occasionally asked to arbitrate on matters of justice or lead prayers in the courts.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Mueller lives in chambers above the temple library, the official residence of the High Priestess. On most days, she stays in the temple to conduct cult business or study. At other times, she officiates in the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists} in @JournalEntry[2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt}. She meets with the @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{Law Lords} on occasion in the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{The Palace}. As the sole non-Ulrican patron of the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, she can be found there on occasion. </p>\n<p>Edel is easy to meet if someone has academic or priestly status. Alternatively, anyone offering to sell books meets an enthusiastic response.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Mueller is disappointed by the world, so she expects little of people — she is immune to the Charm Skill. She has respect for intelligence — if a party member has an Intelligence of above 40, they benefit from +10 to Fellowship Tests. </p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Mueller has a skewed idea of who influences the Graf. She assumes correctly that the @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{Law Lords}, @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Midden Marshals}, and @JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{wizards} have his ear, because they represent power. Beyond that she is unsure who might persuade him to repeal the tax.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>She assumes that @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Schmiedehammer}, @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Lafarel}, @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Schlagen}, and @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} have no influence — because why would the Graf care what they think?</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Mueller wants to see the tax repealed — it’s bad for the @JournalEntry[bBgwBPu0zugAPooq]{Cult of Verena} and the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Wizards’ Guild}. It’s unjust, and even a disillusioned priestess still cares when her goddesses’s justice is violated. She also desires rare books — she currently has her eye on a copy of <em>The New Apocrypha (Volume 4)</em>, a banned text that she believes is hidden in the back room at the @JournalEntry[RVJixZcIIRAwZdC8]{Vermilion Pawn}, a pawnshop in @JournalEntry[ZWV1AbhVVbWfbEIz]{Neumarkt} that carries items of sorcerous nature.</p>\n<h2>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</h2>\n<p>High Priestess Mueller mixes mainly with the city’s educated classes, but she’s recognised throughout the city as an important figure</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>Mueller knows many of the main NPCs and has regular contact with the more educated characters. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: Mueller is slightly dismissive of him as she thinks he has no imagination, calling him the ‘Drab Abacus’ behind his back. She’s heard he’s recently discovered women, which made her roll her eyes.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: She once dismissed him as a stereotypically thick-headed warrior; she was pleasantly surprised by his interest in the history of his role. But last time she met him, he behaved oddly when asked about the tax. While she’s not quite a friend, she can easily provide an introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: Mueller is interested in him because Elves are known to have knowledge hidden from Humans. But she doesn’t trust the influence of the Eonir in Middenheim for that exact reason. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: She considers Katarina a vacuous ornament — of no real importance to serious people or the city of Middenheim.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: A judgemental old rat bag, but harmless enough. She can put in a good word and introduce the Characters to the Chaperone, purely by using her status in the city.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: They’re not her kind of people, but she respects their pragmatism — they’re refreshingly free of the pomposity of most military types and don’t abuse their position.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Mueller is very interested in the wizards and welcomes them to the Temple of Verena. She covets more books from the Wizards’ Guild’s library and has been considering how she might acquire them. If the party want to meet Helseher or Eberhauer, she can introduce them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: She has dealings with Ar-Ulric as one of the city’s religious leaders, and they meet in his capacity as Patron of the Collegium Theologica. She thinks he’s slightly better than your average Ulrican, but not by much. She heard rumours from a student at the Collegium that he is being blackmailed for something, but she’s not sure she believes it.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: No dealings with them, and assumes that they’re fairly dim. She surprised herself when she met Kirsten Jung to discuss her forthcoming nuptials and found her a good-hearted bride-to-be.  </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} – Knight Eternal</strong>: She tolerates him with gritted teeth, as his knowledge of history and collection of military history tomes is impressive.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: Mueller has no dealings with him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Mueller has no dealings with him, but has heard he once had a bad reputation.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: She thinks he’s a charlatan and is taking advantage of the Graf to enjoy his hospitality.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Edel knows them better than most NPCs. She likes Ehrlich and noticed his depression, for which she has sympathy. She hates Hoflich as someone who seems to enjoy punishment. She admires Wasmeier for his scholarship and intelligence. If the party want to meet with the Law Lords and Mueller supports them, she can give them a letter of introduction to help.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Edel enjoys some of the cultural aspects of the Carnival and attends with a few priests from the temple.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>:@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}; <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Opera The Barbarian of Sevile}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Druidic life sculptures}; @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Synchronised flying displays}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Opera The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Opera The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied};</em> @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Black Pool Illuminations Finale}</p>","folder":"udGynnL2hxddlr6Q","sort":600000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":600000}}}
{"_id":"Wue7onedBCazx3ea","name":"Devouring the World","content":"<p>By now the Characters may have become accustomed to the facing off against cultists of the Ruinous Powers. While always terrifying, the may feel that they have come to understand their enemy. However, there are others powers at work in the world, and one in particular has plagued Middenheim since its very founding.</p>\n<p>Of all the enemies that faced Middenheim throughout the ages, the first, and perhaps the greatest, was @Actor[AGyoIt9stdSin46x]{Babrakkos the Liche-Thing}. The undying creature is so integral to the legends surrounding Middenheim’s early days that it is sometimes known as the First Threat. A vile undead monstrosity, Babrakkos remains a puzzle to the scholars of the Collegium Theologica, for it bears little resemblance to Vampires or the revenant kings of distant Khemri. Yet its connection to such things is undeniable. Babrakkos cheated death and commanded animated corpses as its soldiers and servants.</p>\n<p>While Babrakkos could be said to have been killed, there is no place in Morr’s realm for such a foul abomination. Its spirit still lingers around Middenheim in anticipation of the day it will return to lay waste to the heirs of the heroes who once slew it.</p>\n<p>A group called @JournalEntry[Z4vImEgqDM5OcViY]{The Eaters of the World} has grown up around the worship of Babrakkos. They seek to usher in their master’s return, and have long been hunted in Middenheim. In the present day their influence is reduced but not gone. They prefer to work through subtle means, spreading crescent shaped icons of the creature across the city. This has the effect of slowly increasing their master’s presence. In a nameless cellar the cultists gather to give praise, and in an unmarked throne a half scene figure slowly grows more substantial. Babrakkos will return once more, and Middenheim will burn.</p>\n<h3>Unbidden Gifts </h3>\n<p>While the Characters are enjoying the events of the carnival, they are approached by one Eric Schmidt, a young man dressed in carnival attire who is freely handing out small amulets. They are small crescent moons cheaply made and tied to a simple hemp twine. He pushes one to the hands of at least one Character, and bids them to wear it. </p>\n<p>If asked about the meaning of the amulet, Eric will shrug and say they are from a tradition as old as Middenheim, and represent rebirth. He will then continue down the street handing out the amulets to random passers by.</p>\n<p>If the Characters choose to wear the amulet, they will notice little effect during the first day. However, for each additional day they wear it, make an <strong>Average (+20) Cool</strong> Test on behalf of the Character. If they fail, they are troubled by bad dreams of a shadowy figure just out of sight, resting on an unadored throne. If they suffer an Impressive Failure or worse, they also gain one @Condition[Fatigued] Condition which lasts for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>In Middenheim, the prevalence of Ghur makes it hard to pick up on subtle magical details, so any investigation of the amulet by a Character with Magic Sight will reveal little if undertaken inside the city. However, if the amulet is studied outside of Middenheim a subtle note of Shyish can be detected. </p>\n<p>If the Characters look for Eric Schmidt, he can be found around the @JournalEntry[UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{Great Park} during the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}, and later outside the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal Opera House}, still handing out his amulets. If confronted he will plead ignorance, but offer to take the amulet back. He will continue to plead innocent until a chance to escape presents itself, at which point he will hiss <em>‘May his hunger find you last of all,’</em> before sprinting off. If killed, they will see a look of calm cross Schmidts face as he dies, before his eyes roll back in his head and he screams <em>‘Babrakkos! My soul to feed yours!\"</em></p>\n<p>If the Characters pursue this further, they find themselves the target of yet another cult with agents at every level of Middenheim society. Details for weaving a larger adventure around the return of @Actor[AGyoIt9stdSin46x]{Babrakkos} can be found in <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</strong>.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/babrakkos-worshipers.webp","folder":"S7FLDHVd3EvKK0o9","sort":411329,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Cameo Adventures","sort":411329}}}

His lack of interest in politics makes it difficult for the Characters to impress upon him the seriousness of the plot against the Graf, and even more difficult to convince him that he can be of any help to them.</p>\n<p>While he is not as likely as @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} the minstrel to be the target of Dwarf outrage at the new taxes, the Characters may still have the opportunity to rescue Allavendrel from some angry, drunken Dwarfs who are bent on delivering ‘a good kicking’ to any Elf they find.

{"_id":"XY9dT0a5Tin6KKAs","name":"Katarina Todbringer","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/katarina-todbringer.webp\" width=\"231\" height=\"289\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>A Princess in all but her entitlement to the title, she attends some court functions and is also patroness of several artistic and charitable organisations. Her influence over her father would be considerable (3 votes), if she only knew.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Getting close to Katarina is difficult. She lives in the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{palace} with her chaperone. At certain Carnival events it may be possible to find her without her chaperone. Rallane Lafarel the Minstrel might be able to introduce a respectable Character at one of his famous parties. In public and in the Palace, 20 Knights Panther are never far away from her. Failing an introduction from another NPC, a solid pretext will be needed to meet her at any social event. Characters of high social status might make a formal social visit; otherwise, something flamboyant will be necessary.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: –5 to all Fellowship Tests. Katarina has taken on her chaperone's dislike for Dwarfs, though she has begun to question it.</p>\n<p><strong>Elves</strong>: +5 to all Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Although Katarina knows little of direct relevance, she is the most powerful single powerful influence on the Graf, whom the PCs can recruit to their cause. She can get the Characters access to the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{Inner Palace} and, at least in theory, she can summon almost any NPC at fairly short notice — though she will refuse to let the  take too much advantage of her. Well-judged role-playing will be needed to win her over: to be seen to wield influence over politics with strangers to Middenheim is no business for a Princess!</p>\n<p>Tall, handsome male Characters will have to work harder with Katarina than they expect. She demands attention, poetry, serenades, thoughtful and lavish presents, and other romantic gestures; mention of political favours will introduce an unwelcome and slightly sordid note to the courtship. She has powerful influence with the Graf, but the Characters must work hard to win it and to keep it.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Katarina has no misconceptions, but only because she knows nothing of politics. She knows she can get her own way with the Graf, but does not connect this with political influence.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Katarina takes no interest in the tax changes, but she is unhappy that the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{temple of Shallya} — one of her charities — will have to spend funds on the taxes that would otherwise go to help the sick and needy. She hopes to discuss this with her half-brother @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich} before eventually tackling Graf Boris about it.</p>\n<p>Getting a ‘fine, upstanding husband’ is a major goal. Katarina longs to be wooed, like a princess in a fairytale, but her suitors so far have not impressed her. Plausible candidates must be Human, noble, tall, cultured, and handsome. A high Fellowship score and impressive social skills are an absolute must. The Princess requires dramatic (but not vulgar) protestations of undying affection, expensive and aesthetically delightful gifts, and serenades on a warm, moonlit night from the best minstrels.</p>\n<p>Even if none of the Characters is a credible suitor, Katarina may still become infatuated with one of them. Serious attempts to win her heart will almost certainly lead to marriage or incarceration, depending on the Character’s social standing: either way, the character is effectively removed from the campaign. Such an act would also arouse the undying hatred of the chaperone, if she finds out.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: A dusty and tedious old man.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Admires his strength, kindly nature, and courteous manner, as well as his fondness for music. Of course, he is of rather lowly origins, and engaged to someone else.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Likes him and enjoys hearing him play. Laughingly scolds him for his impressions of other court figures, but senses that he is lonely at times.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: Fond of her, but increasingly annoyed at being treated like a child. Katarina increasingly wants the freedom to live her life unsupervised.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: More boring old men.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Has no dealings with them, but she is somewhat awed by magic.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Likes him for his kindly demeanour, charitable nature, and his excellent manners. Knows nothing of his affair with Emmanuelle Schlagen, and would be shocked to learn of it.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ybdS4Z0pbWL8oiND]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: She is haughty and condescending to them, and occasionally spiteful. She knows that her father is having an affair with one of them, but not which one. In a bad mood, she might go so far as to label them ‘strumpets.’</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Thinks him a ‘ninny’, and loves @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane’s} satirical impersonations of him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Has few dealings with him, but likes his gracefulness and good manners — she can see that he is natural and unaffected. She also likes him for being the friend of Rallane the Minstrel.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Who?</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: She is fascinated but horrified by this daring, exciting, amusing, and rather shocking fellow. She can see that he truly cares about Baron Stefan and is clearly helping him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: More dusty old clerks. Let’s talk about someone more interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Thinks Breugal should relax a little, but unconsciously senses the affection he harbours for her and finds him endearing, like an eccentric uncle.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Katarina has no interest in or knowledge of the Cult of Verena.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>Katarina looks up to Begegnen. She knows that the priestess is a selfless soul who makes great sacrifices for the unfortunate people of Middenheim.

{"_id":"Y2Tz145Dqgfl1Chf","name":"For Grognards","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">The Villain</h2>\n<p>Veteran players already know that Wasmeier is the villain of the piece, so you might decide to challenge them by using another of the major NPCs instead. Here are some possibilities.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE CHANCELLOR</h3>\n<p>The Purple Hand has long been working to place agents in positions of influence, and the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} is one of the most powerful people in Middenheim. He might have set up a number of red herrings pointing to the @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Law Lord Wasmeier}, who is actually just what he seems: a studious and hard working public servant who is genuinely opposed to the new taxes. Sparsam’s agents might even have planted certain documents in Wasmeier’s home to incriminate him.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE MINSTREL</h3>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} presents a smiling face to the world, but he may have a darker agenda. In this Dwarf-friendly city, few Elves feel truly at home, and Lafarel’s rise to position and influence were brought about in part through his allegiance to Tzeentch. Sick of the city’s acceptance of Dwarfs, its unlovely architecture, and its lumpish people, he looks forward to bringing the whole place crashing down. He is working with the Purple Hand to make sure that happens. Meanwhile, under the guise of friendly concern, he is visiting the Graf nightly, and playing semi-magical songs that keep his spirits depressed and his senses dulled.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE CHAPERONE</h3>\n<p>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} secretly despises the Graf and his family. She was born into a respectable family with a small amount of noble blood, and taught to look up to her ‘betters’. Yet, she is required to serve a bastard girl — and not the only bastard in the family — and smile upon a master who openly keeps a mistress, even while grieving for his dead wife! All of them disgrace the Todbringer name, and the city they rule is little better. Twisted by bitterness and moral outrage, Hildegarde has decided to bring the whole city crashing down. </p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Hildegarde thinks that the Purple Hand is a secret society devoted to a puritan form of the Ulrican religion, and has no idea of its links to Chaos.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE WIZARDS </h3>\n<p>@Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{High Wizard Helseher} and his deputy, @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}, have been members of the Purple Hand for some time, seduced by a promise of knowledge and advancement. Together they have formulated this plan to turn Middenheim over to their master, placing the blame on the Law Lords — if they are found out. While they publicly oppose the taxes, they plan to use them to rid the city of all spellcasters who are not loyal to the Changer of the Ways.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE LADIES AT COURT</h3>\n<p>Sick of being regarded as mere ornaments to the Graf’s court, one or more of these three ladies at court have thrown in their lot with the Purple Hand. In exchange for the promise of power and influence — and perhaps, even rulership — after the city falls, they are pulling strings, all the while seeming the least likely of threats to the Graf and the city. Power-hungry @Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha} is the most obvious potential villain of the three, but perhaps @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra’s} love of gossip masks a keen political mind. The deep-minded @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten} surely has the intellect to formulate a plan of this complexity. Perhaps all three are acting in concert.</p>\n<p>Whichever villain is chosen, the GM will have to make some adjustments to the locations used in Chapter 6, substituting the chosen villain’s residence for Wasmeier’s house.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">Deadly Secrets</h2>\n<p>Several of the major NPCs have deadly secrets, which the villain is using to manipulate them. Just like the villain’s identity, these secrets can be attached to different NPCs in order to present veteran players with a different challenge.</p>\n<p>An NPC’s behaviour and attitudes may be affected by a deadly secret, and you should amend the NPC descriptions as necessary. To be sure of success, the villain must control NPCs with a total of at least 9 ‘influence votes’ (see ‘@JournalEntry[BGdbAf7b92xpZpfg]{Influencing the Graf}’). Also, it is important that the villain does not control @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}, the Baronial Physician.

{"_id":"YPpM7Pg44EgT2yt5","name":"The Carnival","content":"<p>After the Characters have had a couple of days to explore, and familiarise themselves with the City of the White Wolf, and begin their investigation, Carnival week begins. Considered by many as the highlight of the year, people flock to Middenheim’s Carnival from all corners of The Empire.  Visitors from further afield are a common sight: gaudy aristocrats from Bretonnia; swarthy merchants from Estalia; laconic, hard-drinking Norsemen; and business-minded Wastelanders. During Carnival Week, Middenheim’s population swells by 5,000 or more.</p>\n<p>The Carnival forms the backdrop to this adventure, and you  should keep it constantly in mind. Inns are packed to capacity, people from far and wide crowd the streets, and there is an almost tangible excitement in the air.</p>\n<p>During the Carnival, the normally dour Middenheimers forget their troubles. Jesting, irreverence, intoxication, informality, friendliness to strangers — this is part and parcel of the week. The Carnival spirit is evident in most minor NPC encounters. The atmosphere is intoxicating: the streets are crowded with vendors crying their wares, buskers and street poets performing for coins; the chatter, shoving, and occasional arguments of an ocean of people. The senses are assaulted by noise and bustle; the smell of ale and food hangs heavy in the air. All day and all night, the streets are thronged with people having loud, boisterous fun.</p>\n<p>The locals are very friendly during Carnival week, and outsiders are treated as equals — a marked contrast to the normal attitude. This feeling of camaraderie may help the Characters to feel that they have a stake in the city’s well-being, and that there is nothing to stop them investigating the mystery of the new taxes. When the week-long party ends, though, the Middenheimers will revert back to their normal, pragmatic, no-nonsense selves. By then, one way or the other, the Characters’ job will be over, but the players do not know that.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Many Middenheimers claim that the Carnival is as old as the city. In their version, it was Artur himself — chief of the Teutognens and founder of Middenheim — who declared,<em> ‘Long has been our wandering and long our suffering. This place will be our home — so let’s party!’</em></p>\n<p>Like most neat and pleasing legends, this is complete hogwash. The first Carnival was held in 1812 IC to celebrate the ending of a Middenlander siege. Middenheim had been cut off for over nine months, and was saved only by Dwarf allies, who held off the attackers and prolonged the siege until the onset of winter. As the cold set in, the besieging army was forced to retire, and the Middenheimers were able to celebrate. Unfortunately, foodstuffs were running low, and much of the cuisine consisted of rats and other unpalatables. Everything was heavily smoked or salted to disguise its taste, and to this day the event is commemorated as the ‘1812 Over-Cure.’</p>\n<p>In the following years, the celebration attracted few visitors, since travelling through the snows of winter was not an appealing prospect. Since more visitors meant more money, the city decided to change the date of the Carnival to springtime — sure enough, more people arrived. In the following year, it was suggested (perhaps sarcastically) that the date of the Carnival be moved to the summer.</p>\n<p>This was deemed an even better idea.  A great tradition was started: the Middenheim Carnival now follows a four-yearly cycle through the seasons. Once every four years, at the Winter Carnival, the city has — in effect — its own private celebrations, with few visitors. At other times, though, the city opens its gates wide for anyone and everyone to join in the festivities.</p>\n<p>Of course, like all good tales, there is another version. Cynics argue that the time of the Carnival changes in order to capitalise on those who get the date wrong, and arrive a season too early (or late). Having travelled many miles to have a good time, they are determined to do so, and spend money in any case.</p>\n<p>The lack of dates in the previous paragraphs is deliberate. Whatever time of year the Characters arrive in Middenheim, the Carnival should be about to start.</p>\n<h3>The Fast</h3>\n<p>Carnival is always preceded by a fast on the day before the festivities begin. The fast is not a religious obligation, but traditionally, Middenheimers eat only the kinds of food that were available to their forebears at the end of the siege; most decide to fast for a day in preparation for over indulgence in all forms of earthly delights in the following week.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/streets.webp\" width=\"629\" height=\"339\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-challenge.webp","folder":"3FmEzDwm1adAgzPx","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 5: The Carnival","sort":100000}}}
{"_id":"Yb6ew66hdbL4vBT3","name":"The Gravelord Responds","content":"<p>The first night the Characters spend in the village, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber}  mounts an attack on the Rocheteaus’ house — or, if it has been destroyed by an overzealous party looking for a walled-up body, wherever the couple is spending the night.</p>\n<p>At about two in the morning, lights are seen flitting through the woods to the north of the village. Four skulls are flying toward @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}, about fifteen feet off the ground, each holding a blazing torch in its jaws. They have been ordered to fly to the burgomeister’s house and drop their torches on to its thatched roof. As the occupants flee the burning building, the skulls will swoop down to attack @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet} and @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe}, two skulls to each NPC, ignoring everyone else.</p>\n<p>Anyone trying to shoot or cast spells at the skulls as they approach suffers a –20 penalty for a Little target. The normal –30 penalty for shooting in darkness is offset by the light of the torches that clearly marks the position of each skull.</p>\n<p>If the Characters (perhaps aided by the militia) repulse the skulls, they do not return until the next day. If any skulls are captured or destroyed, it is clear that each has a slogan scrawled across its forehead in charcoal. Two examples are in the box below, and feel free to invent more.</p>\n<p>Further attacks are up to the GM. @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} has a stock of forty skulls in the cave, and can enchant up to four at a time. His objective is to kill Elisabet Rocheteau (and her husband too, if possible), but the GM can extend the adventure by giving him additional goals.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: A LITTLE MORE URGENCY</em></h3>\n<p><em>Players who are familiar with the original version of ‘The Grapes of Wrath’ for the earlier editions of WFRP may be expecting to have a week or so to deal with escalating attacks before the climax of the adventure. In this version, the timescale is rather shorter. This is for two reasons.</em></p>\n<p><em>Firstly, the Characters are probably on their way to Middenheim to begin <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. They have an urgent package to deliver, so time is of the essence.</em></p>\n<p><em>Second, Gräber has been keeping an eye on the village, and he is dismayed to see the Characters arrive: the very same people who were keeping company with @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.bUxA8zyayMarTXP7]{Father Marcus} and the monks whom he punished earlier (see @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.wIbYy6PUBKFdJvPF]{‘Vengeance of the Gravelord’}). Being an incurable egotist, Gräber has decided that the Characters have somehow tracked him to @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}, and he is determined to complete his revenge on the village and its inhabitants — especially @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau} — before they can interfere.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">FEAR THE GRAVELORD</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">This title is familiar to the Characters if they have played @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.wIbYy6PUBKFdJvPF]{Vengeance of the Gravelord}, and should motivate them to hunt down this elusive foe.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">INCONSTANT JADE</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">This refers to @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau} and her laughing rejection of Hans Gräber. Either she or Henri-Phillippe recognise the phrase, which Gräber spat at her before quitting the village in humiliation; other villagers (except Seel Baldurich and @Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder Lechart}, who know nothing) require a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Intelligence</strong> Test to recall it. Everyone except Mathilda Reuter is reluctant to speak of the incident unless the Characters make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> or other Test as determined by the GM. If persuaded, they tell the story of Hans Gräber’s visit as given in @JournalEntry[u0jibG3CVNoLK6GT]{The Story}. This gives the Characters a name and a physical description of their opponent, and should motivate them to track him down.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Vengeance Completed</h3>\n<p>For a short, simple adventure, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} considers his vengeance complete when @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau} is dead, but if the Characters are close to finding him, he may be satisfied with leaving her seriously injured.</p>\n<p>To prolong the action, and give the Characters further opportunities to capture a skull or find @Scene[gxjWgssIvXIUd2D7]{Gräber’s lair}, he could have a more extensive revenge in mind. At the GM’s option, additional goals might include some or all of the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Elisabet Rocheteau must die!</em> Gräber will not cease his attacks while she lives.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>Elisabet Rocheteau must pay!</em> After the attack on the Rocheteaus’ house, a skull flies over the village, high and fast, dropping a streamer tied to a small stone (for even more fun, the GM might decide that this is a small piece of warpstone from the cave). Attached to the streamer is a note that reads, <em>‘Save your village. Surrender Elisabet Rocheteau. Alone, where the woman saw the skull. One hour after dusk. Tonight. No more warnings. –The Gravelord.’</em> See <strong>The Trap</strong> below.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>Pritzstock must be destroyed! </em>Starting with the Rocheteaus’ house, Gräber sends wave upon wave of skulls to burn every house in the village. Every hour or so, four more come out of the woods, and the Characters must choose whether to aid the villagers in fighting the resulting fires, destroying the skulls, or following them back to their master. Gräber launches each attack from a different location, so the skulls come from a different direction every time; he does not stop the attacks until he is found, or he runs out of skulls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Trap</h3>\n<p>@Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Henri-Phillippe} refuses the Gravelord’s ultimatum, but the party may be able to persuade him to let them use Elisabet as bait in a trap, if she also agrees to the plan. If not, some substitute might be used, such as Erietta Surhardt (if she is back on her feet) or a Character in disguise.</p>\n<p>If persuading a villager to act as a decoy, the Characters should stress that they will be nearby every step of the way, and they must previously have shown that they are capable of dealing with the skulls.</p>\n<h4>A Fate Worse Than…?</h4>\n<p>Gräber has not decided what to do with @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet} if she is delivered to him. He is torn between visiting some terrible necromantic punishment on her or launching into an impassioned appeal. In his twisted mind, the havoc he has wrought is a sign of his love, and surely no one who would do so much to win a woman’s heart could ever be refused. For want of anything more definite, he has decided to make up his mind once he has seen Elisabet’s initial reaction to him.</p>\n<h4>The Watchers in the Trees</h4>\n<p>However confused he might be in matters of the heart, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} has not overlooked the possibility that @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet} will not come alone as ordered, and that the Characters or someone else will try to turn the rendezvous into an ambush. Accordingly, he established himself at the rendezvous point before sending his demand, and has four skulls watching the area.</p>\n<p>The skulls are half-hidden in the trees, requiring a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test to spot on account of their small size and the covering foliage. The Characters cannot come within a hundred yards of the appointed spot without crossing the field of vision of one of the watching skulls, but since he can only see through the eyes of one skull at a time, there is only a @Roll[1d100]{25%} chance of being spotted on their approach. After that, the Characters are only spotted if they are not attempting to hide, or if they fail a Stealth Test when shifting their position: this is opposed by @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} Perception of 46, although he suffers a –10 penalty because he can only see from the skulls’ viewpoint, and not hear.</p>\n<p>If Gräber sees any sign that @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet} is not alone, or that there is a decoy in her place, he orders the four skulls to swoop down from the trees, attacking Elisabet or her decoy once each in passing before forming into a line and heading off through the trees (away from @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} position) at maximum speed. Under cover of this distraction, he quietly withdraws into the woods, heading back to the cave. Once there, he orders any surviving skulls to return to him by a roundabout route.</p>","folder":"XPM9XriCft4SkXW7","sort":606250,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":606250}}}
{"_id":"YxDrghP4COZgvqSV","name":"Chaos Strikes By Night","content":"<p>This optional event gives the Characters a chance to meet @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Watch Commander Schutzmann}. Although the Characters will probably not realise it at the time, it also offers a chance to recover @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich’s} kidnapped niece Reya, winning his eternal gratitude and setting events in motion that brings this adventure to its climax. It also faces the Characters with a group of Skaven, providing the first of several threads that leads into the next adventure in the campaign: <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. It may be used if the Players are finding things too easy or if they are spoiling for a fight.</p>\n<p>If you decide to use this event, the time should be about an hour before dawn on any day before Festag (Day 8), when the Characters are resting in the @JournalEntry[ieHrUyFz83TkBikg]{Templar’s Arms} or another inn. The enemy is quite strong, and their numbers may be adjusted if necessary, to make them a challenge without being an insuperable foe.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: SLEEPLESS NIGHTS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Grognard Players may be expecting this event, but you should remember that it is optional. Omitting it, especially if the Players are talking about having their Characters stay up all night just in case something happens, does nothing to weaken the plot of the adventure, and it does not make their task any more difficult — apart, of course, from some penalties for sleep deprivation, which can be imposed according to your whim.</em></p>\n<p><em>The encounter offers the Characters four potential benefits, all of which can be found elsewhere in the adventure:</em></p>\n<p><em>First, it foreshadows the Skaven in the same way as encounters in the campaign’s previous instalments. While the Skaven become important later in the adventure, and in the next instalment, <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, the Characters have already heard rumours about them and their appearance in the finale of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> will not come as too much of a surprise.</em></p>\n<p><em>Second, it gives the Characters another potential clue about the whereabouts of @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich’s} kidnapped niece, whose rescue is a major turning point in this adventure. However, the Characters have other ways of discovering the @Scene[mdyEnjutTaGPzPxz]{lair of the villain’s pawns}, where she is being held.</em></p>\n<p><em>Third, it provides the Characters with a way to meet  @Actor[ThOmnHA3l1Slh78K]{Erina Eberhauer}, the Deputy High Wizard’s sister, and a chance to make a good impression on her and ask her to introduce them to her sister. As noted in @JournalEntry[pme5rvqJDqgDOPlt]{The High Wizard and his Deputy}, though, there are many other opportunities for the Characters to meet her.</em></p>\n<p><em>Finally, a party that acquits itself well during this event can win a favourable interview with Watch @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Commander Schutzmann}. Like any of the major NPCs, though, they have other options for meeting him.</em></p>\n<p><em>While a cruel GM enjoys watching Characters tire themselves out with unnecessary night-long watches, it can also be entertaining to have some unexpected things happen while the players are waiting for Skaven who never arrive. Thieves might try to sneak into their room at night; powerful enemies might hire agents to plant incriminating or embarrassing evidence among their belongings; cult assassins might try to murder them; and any number of other things might happen. One very embarrassing possibility is to have the Characters hear the sounds of a struggle in an adjoining room and break down the door, only to find a couple </em>in flagrante delicto<em> — and discover that one of them is a major NPC whom they had hoped to befriend, and upon whom they have just made a very bad first impression.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Enemy Beneath</h3>\n<p>Skaven have been sighted in Middenheim’s undercity, off and on, ever since the days of Count Mandred. Dwarf tunnel fighters and Middenheimer sewer jacks conduct regular sweeps of the lower levels, and the authorities follow up any sightings vigorously; in order to avoid panic, official policy is to deny that Skaven exist, and to maintain that the Dwarfs occupy the lowest levels of the undercity, leaving no tunnel or cavern unguarded.</p>\n<p>To the average Middenheimer, the Skaven are a myth; exterminated in the Skaven Wars more than a thousand years ago. Those who claim to have seen them are dismissed as cranks; those who claim they infest a massive tunnel network beneath the whole of the Old World have a tendency to find their way into the Sisters of Shallya, at remote asylums such as the Great Hospice near Frederheim.</p>\n<p>Of those who know about Skaven, the vast majority regard them as enemies. Even the other Ruinous Powers of Chaos distrust them as a race — but to a few, their services are valuable. Their secret ways allow them to move in and out of places unseen, and those who meet their price find them reliable. The evil Law Lord, @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}, hired a Skaven band for an important part of his plan: the kidnapping of @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich’s} niece Reya from her parents’ farmstead outside the town.</p>\n<p>While Wasmeier’s Doppelgänger, in the form of @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Law Lord Hoflich}, threatened the terrified Ehrlich into cooperating with the plan, the Skaven held Reya beneath the city. With the plan nearing its conclusion, they delivered his niece to Wasmeier’s human agent, who passed her on to @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich}.</p>\n<p>Having been assured of his reward, Snikkit has undertaken a further contract to retrieve a map showing @JournalEntry[F7Bh2C9eZXD9dkP3]{Brass Keep} from the @JournalEntry[ieHrUyFz83TkBikg]{Templar's Arms} — or wherever the Characters happen to be staying. His band also takes the opportunity to induldge in some slave raiding on the unfortunate occupants of the inn.  </p>\n<h3>Confusion In The Inn</h3>\n<p>The first thing the Characters know of events will be shouting and screaming from the inn’s main bar-room. They will have exactly one minute before the door is kicked open and they are faced with a pair of Skaven warriors. Run this minute in real time; time a minute from the first scream, add noises like shouting, crashes, footsteps on the stairs and so on. If the party ends up shouting at each other in a panic, things are going well.</p>\n<p>Keep a careful note of how long the Characters take to act. They should have time to grab a weapon, and put on easily-donned armour (coif, helmet, shield), but stopping to don a full suit of armour, or casting more than one spell per spellcaster, is out of the question. If the party is quick off the mark, they may be able to deal with several of the band piecemeal as they are still searching the inn in pairs and rounding up hostages; this will help them a great deal in any later confrontation.</p>\n<p>The Skaven band is rounding up everyone in the inn and herding them into the bar, where they are tied up. Those who offer no resistance will not be harmed (much); live humans have value in the undercity. Most of the inn’s guests will flee rather than fight. Just who is captured and who flees is up to you. However, it is suggested that the Halfling cook, @Actor[LBnd0qLlBx83Z1pD]{Tiasmara} be captured and threatened; this will stop @Actor[sXAWtX6OhNOpMuQc]{Uli} and his staff from wading in.</p>\n<p>Once they have tied up some guests, @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit} tears down an old campaign map showing the Middle Mountains which hangs on the bar’s wall, rolls it up, and sticks it in his belt. This is not likely to be noticed by the Characters until after the fact, and will not play a part in this adventure. </p>\n<p>Remember that this is a very volatile situation, and be prepared to play things by ear. Most of the Skaven are as nervous as their hostages, and may suddenly erupt into violence — or lose their nerve and make a run for it — at any time. If possible their leader, Snikkit, should either fight to the death or escape into the sewers, rather than being captured.</p>\n<h3>The Skaven</h3>\n<p>The band consists of @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit}, their leader, and six @Actor[pVTXDRks9nejkcbe]{Skaven warriors}. Numbers may be adjusted to ensure that they provide a challenge for the Characters, without being unbeatable.</p>\n<h3>A Helping Hand</h3>\n<p>While the number of Skaven should be adjusted to be roughly equal to the strength of the party, the incident might be used to introduce the Characters to a potential ally: the Deputy High Wizard’s younger sister, @Actor[ThOmnHA3l1Slh78K]{Erina Eberhauer}. If she is staying at the inn, add two or three more Skaven to the band so that the fight does not become too easy.</p>\n<p>Erina fights intelligently, staying out of the fray, and using ranged spells to help the Characters.</p>\n<p>She arrived in Middenheim earlier in the day, planning to surprise her sister. She does not willingly admit to being related to the @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Deputy High Wizard} — far too many people ask for favours — but she reports the Skaven to Janna, and mentions the Characters if they performed well. This may lead to an interview with the Deputy High Wizard, who wants to find out all she can about the incident, and track the Skaven’s route into the city if possible. The Characters may have the opportunity to ask some questions of their own, but Janna makes it clear that her questions must be answered first — until she becomes convinced that the new taxes are a part of some sinister plan.</p>\n<h3>@Actor[ThOmnHA3l1Slh78K]{Erina Eberhauer}</h3>\n<p>In her early 20s and of average height, Erina has an athletic build, auburn hair, hazel eyes, and a smattering of freckles that belie a serious nature. Those who have seen her sister the Deputy High Wizard will notice a family resemblance on a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test. Erina is fiercely intelligent, decisive, and matter-of-fact; while not unfriendly, she will initially be reserved toward the Characters, and everyone else.</p>\n<h3>The Battle</h3>\n<p>The party can stand and fight, or they can flee. In either case, they should survive — perhaps wounded, and perhaps minus a Fate Point or two, but alive.</p>\n<p>The Watch will arrive in force ([[/r 2D10 + 2]] Watchmen with two Sergeants and a Captain) some 5 minutes after the attack begins. If the Skaven have been defeated by then, all well and good. The Captain asks for the Characters’ names and commend them on their public-spirited actions. The following afternoon, they and any NPCs who assisted are summoned by @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Watch Commander Schutzmann}, who listens to their account of the incident and offers them his congratulations; this can be a very good introduction to this NPC — see @JournalEntry[3sFdJskJYiLvUWkc]{The Debrief} for more.</p>\n<p>If the party fails to deal with the situation, the Skaven leave the inn, vanishing into the night.</p>\n<h3>Prisoners</h3>\n<p>If the party takes any prisoners, they have a limited time to question them before the Watch takes them away. None know where they went in the city; they moved underground by a twisting route. All they can say is that they took a young, female Human from a farm, and hid her in the Drakwald Forest before bringing her to the city. They cannot describe the person to whom they handed the young woman over, apart from stating that he had prominent 'whiskers'.</p>\n<h4>A Lucky Find</h4>\n<p>If time is pressing and the players have somehow managed to get nowhere — but not otherwise — you might allow the Characters a clue to help them find the @Scene[mdyEnjutTaGPzPxz]{lair} of @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} agent @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} and her minions. @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit}, the Skaven leader, is carrying a crude map that shows a part of the city’s sewer system and a location marked with a few symbols in the Skaven tongue of Queekish. It is quite unlikely that any of the Characters can read this language, and none of the other Skaven is literate: still, this location is clearly significant, and may be where the child was delivered. A <strong>Difficult (–10) Navigation</strong> Test will enable the Characters to follow the map to the lair.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>TEMPERED LUCK</em></h3>\n<p><em>The above option gives GMs an solution for parties who are truly lost — the Skaven attack wherever they are staying, and a convenient map leads directly to the kidnapped neice of @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich}. While Ehrlich does not know quite who is blackmailing him, he is sure to make such a fuss that @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, fearful the net may be closing about him, will make his move on the Graf early — preferably while the Characters are nearby to intervene.</em></p>\n<p><em>However, most struggling parties will not require such drastic measures. Instead, you may wish to have a surviving Skaven, fluent in Reikspeial, add that he heard the girl calling out for her uncle, who she claimed was 'an wielder of laws, yes yes!' This could be used to put direct the Characters towards @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich}, without also short-circuiting the entire plot.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Skaven Myth</h3>\n<p>Reports of Skaven will be treated with skepticism by the Watch and other city authorities. Most Middenheimers know the story of Count Mandred and the Ratmen, but only as a fable. Only a few believe it is based on fact, and most of those regard the ‘Ratmen’ as normal Beastmen, whose rat heads were added by some storyteller centuries ago. If the Characters’ account is backed up by multiple witnesses, the authorities grudgingly concede that these particular beastmen did indeed have rat-like heads — but rats are beasts, after all, so there is no reason to suppose that these creatures are some mythical threat out of an old story. Some slightly more informed people might claim that Skaven were real, but Mandred did away with every last one centuries ago. </p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/heres-snikkit.webp","folder":"IOqzzXGRK0YmZ3sY","sort":1675000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":1675000}}}

{"_id":"ZDyb9Dfsd7SfnKVs","name":"Initial Inquiries: The Taxes","content":"<p>@JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{The Taxes}</p>\n<p>Sooner or later, the Characters should come to the conclusion that it would be worthwhile to find out more about the new tax laws that have upset so many people. Depending on their careers, personalities, and inclinations, they have several possible sources, each of which can provide certain information. Of course, each of these sources has its own point of view, which complicates matters somewhat: some ambiguities or downright contradictions may arise, requiring the Characters to sift through the snippets of information they have amassed and put the pieces together as best they can. The GM should not be afraid to repeat items: observant Players realise that confirmations are valuable.</p>\n<h3>General Sentiments</h3>\n<p>Reactions to the new taxes vary widely. Apart from a few, described above — who think the taxes are an Ulrican plot to force out other religions, an Altdorfer conspiracy to weaken the city in preparation for conquest and subjugation, a profiteering move by the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}, or an Elven plot against the city’s Dwarfs — the majority of Middenheimers do not much care one way or the other. So long as they are unaffected, the taxes are someone else’s problem. A few may grumble about delays at the gates, but that is all.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are especially slow to realise the deeper implications of the taxes, they may overhear some bar-room pundit holding forth on the contributions of the Dwarfs, the wizards, and the priests to Middenheim’s construction and defence. Over the jeers and groans of his listeners, this prophet of doom loudly maintains that someone high up in the government is trying to drive them all out, clearly for some sinister purpose. Most people, though, are concerned with the pleasures of the Carnival, and with their own day-to-day worries.</p>\n<p>Those directly affected by the taxes have a different attitude. Any Dwarf is furious about the Dwarf Tax, both at the cost, and at the insult it represents to the Dwarven race: <em>‘No Elf Tax, is there? Halfling Tax? Not on your life? Human Tax? Now that one would make some money — but no. It’s an outrage, so it is, and by stone and steel we won’t stand for it!’</em></p>\n<p>Wizards, alchemists, and priests, while privately fuming, are less vocal until they know they are among friends. The Guild and the various temples are pursuing the matter, they are sure, and the Graf is not an unreasonable man: this is clearly some mistake, and will shortly be corrected. Of course, there are always a few individuals who react more strongly, especially after a few drinks, and students at the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica} may take the opportunity to abandon their classes for a day of protests, drinking, and general rowdiness. They may hope to arouse more widespread public indignation, but mostly they will succeed in annoying their fellow citizens.</p>\n<p>Only a few people are enthusiastically in favour of the new taxes. Elves smirk and joke about the Dwarf Tax, and those with reason to dislike wizards or priests do the same about those taxes, but almost no one vocally supports all three measures.</p>\n<p>The exception is members of the Purple Hand, who have been instructed by their superiors to promote the taxes at every opportunity. However, they have little idea why the taxes are important, and their arguments may seem ill-informed and unconvincing.</p>\n<p>Eventually, this constant background noise should prompt the Characters to seek information from reliable sources. This may include various guilds, Komissions, temples, and any major NPCs whose acquaintance is the way into the main part of the adventure.</p>\n<p>The following information can be gained from Middenheimers of all types. The tone and some minor details might be altered to reflect the nature of the informant: a drunkard can only tell a little, a barman a little more, and a modestly-educated merchant more still. Educated people, if asked specific questions they are unable to answer, and direct the Characters to an appropriate source for further information.</p>\n<h4>When Were the Taxes Passed?</h4>\n<p>The tax changes were introduced just under a month ago. Some taxes are taken when entering and leaving the city, and a widespread belief is that they have been introduced to coincide with Carnival, to rake in more money from visitors. Others are taken at the end of every month. The first monthly payment is due at the end of the Carnival. So far, the authorities have been very zealous about collecting them.</p>\n<h4>Who Sets the Tax Laws?</h4>\n<p>The average citizen can only give partial, and sometimes misleading, information. By far the most common reply points to the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, since his prime role is the implementation of fiscal policy. Other candidates are the Graf and the Law Lords, both being seen as great wielders of power. A more enlightened informant may direct the Characters to the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful GuiId of Legalists}, saying that they can get a fuller version there.</p>\n<h4>Graf Boris and his Advisors</h4>\n<p>It is common knowledge that @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} is ailing and depends heavily on his advisors. Some — the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, the Law Lords, the ‘@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Princess}’ — are widely known as influential, while some are not; no one knows, for example, that the Graf has a paramour. Some major NPCs are more socially visible than others: the Chancellor, being a recluse, is hardly known by most people, while the @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Court Minstrel}, a real extrovert, is better-known.</p>\n<h4>The Graf ’s Sons</h4>\n<p>The common folk are dimly aware that @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan} has some kind of health issue, but know little of him and have never seen him. @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich} is a more interesting case. He is not particularly well-known among the general public, for he adopts a low profile in social life, and is out of the city for long periods of time. However, most Middenheimers should be able to give at least a vague description of him, ‘HUGE man, he is — a giant!’.</p>\n<h4>Red Herrings</h4>\n<p>Some folk give credence to bizarre rumours. Graf Boris is controlled by Daemons; he converses with a magical oracular pool in the palace; or any of a dozen equally wild tales. </p>\n<p>In general, the people holding these views also believe that the world is flat, that Mannslieb is made of cheese, and so on, and the Characters should have cause to doubt them. Of course, certain rumours are more widespread: for example, Rallane is frequently blamed for the Dwarf Tax (although not for the others), and the Midden Marshals are generally thought to have more political influence than they do.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE CITY COUNCILS</em></h3>\n<p><em>There are three councils that are relevant to this stage of the adventure: the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists}, the @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, and the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission for Elven, Dwarven and Halfling Interests}. Their offices are open from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. Asking questions at any of the other City Councils is  a waste of time.</em></p>\n<p><em>They generally work on the same principle: an enquirer explains the nature of the enquiry to a clerk, who then wanders off to locate the person best able to deal with the question. This can take anything up to an hour, but a 15-minute wait is average. Of course, if the enquirer has subsequent questions, or if the original question was phrased ambiguously, then another official may have to be found.</em></p>\n<p><em>For the questions the Characters may ask, the correct official is named; on future visits they can ask for him or her personally and save time, cutting the average waiting time to 10 minutes.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{The Worshipful Guild Of Legalists}</h3>\n<p>This guild has many functions connected with the law. Indeed, it was they who drafted the new taxes, but it is not their job to formulate original policy. They deal in facts in vast quantities — and prepare official versions for release to the public.</p>\n<p>Clerk Hubergreiber, a low-ranking clerk, is the man to see about the tax laws. He is able to provide a summary of the @JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{information}: who is taxed, when, how often, and how much. He can say, if asked, that the tax was implemented less than one month ago, and that the first monthly collection is due the day after the Carnival ends. The Guild is looking for more scribes to handle the monumental quantity of paperwork required by the new laws. Hubergreiber may offer a job to any character with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write} Talent, especially if they also have <em>Art (Writing)</em> or <em>Art (Calligraphy)</em>.</p>\n<h4>Who Sets the Tax Laws?</h4>\n<p>Senior Clerk Wahnsinnige can discuss this in a very dry, bureaucratic manner. The GM should read the players the following information more or less verbatim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The interests of merchants, and similar people are represented by the Chairman of the Merchants’ Guild, who makes recommendations to the City Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation. The current Chairman of the Guild — Herr Gotthard Wallenstein — is also, as it happens, Chairman of the Komission.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other interested bodies, such as the temples and the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, make their representations via other city Councils, according to the nature of the matter at hand: in some cases the @JournalEntry[WI5fxShETkV7ungB]{Komission for Health, Education and Welfare}; in others the @JournalEntry[fofmTR3LuoaMVLa0]{Komission for Public Works}; and so on.</p>\n<p>The @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation} then makes representations to the Law Lords. The Law Lords weigh up the matter, and the @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists} assists in the drafting of proposed legislation. The resulting document is put before the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, who may make further recommendations, and then before the Graf. The Graf then weighs up the matter after discussing it with other advisors, and may pass the legislation, return it with directions for amendment, or, in rare cases, reject it.</p>\n<p>The @JournalEntry[npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists} does not itself have any role in forming policy, but merely drafts the laws as directed by the Law Lords, after due and aforementioned consultation.</p>\n<p>As to the advisors to whom the Graf may turn for comments on proposed legislation, Graf Boris may consult anyone who he feels is qualified to render useful advice.</p>\n<p>This tells the Characters very little, and a tiresome encounter it is too, although the gist is simple enough: the Graf speaks to anyone he wants, listens to anyone he wants, and everyone else does what he wants.</p>\n<h4>The Law Lords</h4>\n<p>Any questions about the role of the Law Lords is referred to Clerk Valberik, who is able to summarise the workings of the Law Lords: they vote on policy in secret meetings, and the majority decision is put to the Graf. If the decision is not unanimous, differences of opinion are never revealed.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{The Komission For Elven, Dwarven, and Halfling Interests}</h3>\n<p>The Council was set up over a hundred years ago when there was tension between Elves and Dwarfs, and both communities felt ill-treated by the Human majority in the city. The ruler at the time thought it a wise move to institute this official channel to care for their interests, and did not want to offend the more placid Halflings by leaving them out. It is now not very active, but is responsible for organising some of the nonhuman cultural events in the Carnival. Waiting and bureaucracy here are minimal.</p>\n<h4>General Enquiries</h4>\n<p>A nonhuman character can arrange for an interview here on almost any pretext. Enquiries are usually dealt with by a staff member of the same race as the enquirer: Dwarfs are met by Clerk Thognar, Elves by Clerk Malondel, and Halflings by Clerk Huggins. Both Elf and Halfling have little to say, except that the Dwarf Tax sets a bad precedent. In addition, Malondel points out that with many Elves following wizardry as a profession, the Scroll Tax is causing concern. Humans can see Thognar about the Dwarf Tax, or Malondel about the Scroll Tax, if they express concern and seem interested in doing something about it.</p>\n<h4>Rallane and the Dwarf Tax</h4>\n<p>If Malondel is asked about the court minstrel @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}, and his possible role in the Dwarf Tax, he looks most disapproving and say that this is a scurrilous rumour spread about by people who ought to know better. The view held by Elves (and Halflings) is that it is simply a money-grabbing exercise by the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}.</p>\n<p>If Clerk Thognar is asked about this, he tries to hides his seething anger. He explains that the Dwarfs are collecting a petition complaining at great length to Graf Boris, ‘and we can count on your signatures, of course?’ If he is taken out after work for a drink, he becomes more forthcoming (unless there are any Elves with the party) and denounce Rallane as the person responsible for the tax: <em>‘He hates our people, and other folk think we’re all rich because we work hard — that’s probably how he got support for the idea.’</em></p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/elven-dwarf-halfling-interests.webp\" width=\"246\" height=\"199\" /></div>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{The Komission For Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}</h3>\n<p>Although this is an obvious place to enquire about the tax changes, the Chairman of the Council, @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}, is almost never here, and neither he nor the senior clerk Franz Christoph Becker agrees to see the Characters anyway. Clerk Udiller sees the Characters but, following his masters’ lead, will say little. Given half a chance, the clerk directs the Characters to another council or guild, saying that the Komission’s job is simply to collect the taxes in the most efficient way: ‘It’s nothing to do with us, really.’ This Komission is gaining a reputation for doing nothing for anyone but the merchants.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/commerce-trade-taxation.webp\" width=\"169\" height=\"189\" /></div>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE GUILDS</em></h3>\n<p><em>These institutions exist to promote the interests of their members. Middenheim, like any other large city, has its fair share of guilds, though for this adventure only four are relevant: the Grand Guild of Wizards, the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}, the @JournalEntry[A6D8GCA2S0g8vw8K]{Dwarven Engineers’ Guild}, and — though not exactly a guild — the loose-knit community of Middenheim’s underworld.</em></p>\n<p><em>On visiting a guild, an individual is asked to provide a membership number. If he or she is not a member, provisional acceptance can be made for the duration of Carnival week. This costs a gold crown, and the character must prove eligibility for membership by answering some profession-related questions. A guild does not deal with persons who are not members.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{The Grand Guild Of Wizards}</h3>\n<p>At this stage, no one — not even a wizard — can get a meeting with the @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{High Wizard} or his @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Deputy}, but the Characters can try to by-pass formal procedure and try to meet them in a public or social encounter.</p>\n<p>Even so, the guildhouse is bustling with Wizards and Apprentices: some looking for news; some looking for contacts with Wizards in other cities besides Altdorf; and some simply looking for like-minded folk to vent their frustrations. Feelings are running high: some wizards have already left Middenheim to avoid the monthly tax, though the majority are waiting to see if an eleventh-hour agreement can be reached. Guild members are mystified by the taxes, pointing out the role of the Guild and the High Wizard in maintaining the defences of the city.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/grand-guild-of-wizards.webp\" width=\"307\" height=\"184\" /></div>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{The Merchants’ Guild}</h3>\n<p>The drinking-room of this guild is always full of merchants and traders discussing this and that, and they happily talk about the taxes. They are not too bothered, for the most part: <em>‘Glad it wasn’t us’</em> is the usual attitude. The more thoughtful types, though, are concerned:<em> ‘It’ll turn out badly. The Dwarfs are good workers and good spenders, and this will bring trouble.’</em> Several members suspect that the Chancellor is behind the taxes, especially the Scroll Tax. <em>‘Sort of thing he’d do. Problem with him is he doesn’t see the effects on people. Bit of a recluse, he is.’</em></p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[A6D8GCA2S0g8vw8K]{The Dwarven Engineers’ Guild}</h3>\n<p>A similar response is seen here as at the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission for Elven, Dwarven, and Halfling Interests}. A petition is proffered, even if the Characters have signed it before. Nothing new can be learned over a few beers; the Dwarfs — mainly engineers and  artisans — spend most of their time moaning and making provisional plans to leave. There is some talk of ambushing either @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} or the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, and making the Dwarf point of view known forcefully.</p>\n<h3>The Underworld</h3>\n<p>There is no centralised Thieves’ Guild in Middenheim, but most criminal activities are overseen by two powerful gangs, one based in Ostwald and the other in the Altquartier. The leaders of these gangs are known colloquially in Middenheim as the @JournalEntry[vcw9pxNsMoxkTbRV]{Low Kings}. They vie with each other violently, and any criminal who seeks to operate in their territories without handing over a quota of their takings best keep their activities secret, unless they are forced at knifepoint to be more cooperative.</p>\n<p>There are various ways of contacting the underworld. For example, a Thief (or other Rogue Character) might locate an NPC rogue by watching for signs of thieving on the streets — requiring a successful <strong>Difficult (+0) Observe</strong> Test, repeated every hour until successful — or an NPC thief might spot and approach a Character thief.</p>\n<p>In the second case, the NPC makes a sign of recognition specific to Middenheim. When the Character fails to respond properly, the NPC will quietly point out that it might be a good idea to come along for a chat: after all, it’s difficult to pick a pocket without fingers, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>After some preliminary sounding-out in which the locals will establish to their satisfaction that the Character is genuine and not in the pay of the authorities, a nocturnal meeting is arranged. The Character is offered provisional membership to cover Carnival week at a cost of a gold crown, and is then taught the local dialect of <em>Thieves’ Tongue</em> (the character must already have the basic Skill) and told about various contact points. If there is time for a solo adventure, the Character thief might be set a task as proof of ability and goodwill.</p>\n<p>Questions about the taxes or the court is met with some puzzlement, but this is satisfied by any reasonably non-committal reply (‘just curiosity: it seems a bit odd’). The NPC thief casually mentions that he knows someone who can find out anything about anything, if the price is right. If the Character agrees, a further meeting is arranged in a secluded tavern some 12 hours later, for a [[/r d10+3]] shilling, ‘arrangement fee.’</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At this meeting, the Character is introduced to ‘Josef,’ a shifty individual aged about 40, who never looks anyone in the eye. Josef collects and sells information for a living — he neither knows nor cares what any of it means, so long as he gets his fee ([@Pay[3ss]{3 schillings}, in advance, no haggling). He charges an additional fee (which he may try to bargain upwards, though usually about 2 shillings) for each piece of information he passes on. Josef never reveals his sources.</p>\n<h4>Josef ’s Knowledge</h4>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} is probably not behind the Dwarf Tax. It is not his style, and he expressed surprise when it was introduced ([[/r d10]] shillings).</p>\n<p>The Midden Marshals do not have as much influence as many people claim, and the @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Knight Eternal} has none at all ([[/r 2d10]] shillings).</p>\n<p>@Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich} was seen leaving the Palace visibly upset the day Graf Boris passed the new taxes. This coincided with the start of his current fit of depression ([[/r 5d10]] shillings).</p>\n<p>After passing on this information, Josef develops an uneasy  look, and players may guess that he knows more. If pressed, helean forwards and say in a low voice:</p>\n<p><em>‘All right, but putting this in the wrong ears could get you burnt or worse. @Pay[1gc]{A Crown} gets you something about Ar-Ulric — no messing about, yes or no?’</em> He can be bargained down to @Pay[10ss]{10 schillings}, and if an agreement is reached he says that Ar-Ulric has been seen leaving the apartments of the Ladies-at-Court late at night: <em>‘A bit naughty, that, considering his vow of celibacy and all.’</em></p>\n<p>Josef may possess other pieces of information, if you wish. Their price can be based on the importance of the individual or group mentioned.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE TEMPLES</em></h3>\n<p><em>Any Character priest who visits his or her temple in the city hears a good deal of complaint. The biggest question concerns the relationship between the Graf and the cult of Ulric. On the one hand, why would the Graf risk alienating them when the cult of Sigmar already regards him as a threat? On the other hand, why has the cult of Ulric not spoken out against the taxes, especially when High Priest Ar-Ulric is one of the Graf’s advisors?</em></p>\n<p><em>Popular rumour is that, while they have a lot to lose, the cult of Ulric is the richest in the city, and plans to sit tight while pressure of taxation squeezes the others out.</em></p>\n<p><em>There is no information on the origins of the taxes or the destination of the money raised, but the temples know that the taxes certainly do not reflect any popular anti-clerical feeling. If anything, the general population was as surprised as the groups affected.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: If the Character priest visit the temples of other deities, they should behave with the utmost respect and tact. In particular, the presence of a priest of Sigmar in the temple of Ulric (or vice-versa) could be seen as provocative.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{The Temple Of Ulric}</h3>\n<p>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} is frequently absent on business, but his juniors, Franz Fassbinder and Gilda Heinzer, ensure that little is given away here. They are both excellent at deflecting questions. </p>\n<p>Even the junior priests say little. It is clear that the priests are not happy about the tax, but they do not condemn it in as forthright a manner as one might expect: a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test reveals that a priest interviewed here appears to be hesitant in what he or she is saying.</p>\n<p>The priests of Ulric are in a difficult position: they cannot openly condemn the taxes without appearing to condemn their leader’s apparent failure to stop them, and yet they cannot speak in their favour either. Most try to skirt the issue, saying that such matters are not for ordinary folk to comment on; they may be more open with a character who wins their trust and approaches the question diplomatically.</p>\n<p>If a Character priest of Ulric is able to gain an interview with Fassbinder or Heinzer (this takes 1-3 days to arrange, and only priests of Ulric are admitted) a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test leads to their dropping a hint about their reasons for their relative lack of vigour in originally condemning the taxes: they must follow @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric’s} lead, and he has given no sign of his views on the matter: on an Impressive or better success, they say that he seems preoccupied lately, and he has been difficult to approach.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[vAaGf9u5fHrlxSSs]{The Temple Of Sigmar}</h3>\n<p>Feelings run higher here than in the temple of Ulric, and, although the priests are rather tight-lipped, their anger is obvious. On a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Gossip</strong> Test, a junior priest might forget himself so far as to accuse Ar-Ulric of supporting the tax to squeeze the other temples out of the city; on an Impressive or better success, he may even question whether the temple of Ulric is actually paying the Temple Tax.</p>\n<p>The priests of Sigmar also feel that the Dwarf Tax is a deliberate slight on their cult, given the historical links between the cult of Sigmar and the Dwarven people.</p>\n<p>High Capitular Werner Stolz (a High Priest of Sigmar) is not available to meet with the Characters, but they can learn that he met with the Grand Theogonist privately during his recent visit, and denounced both Ar-Ulric and Graf Boris in no uncertain terms. Needless to say, this does nothing to reduce the current tension between the Empire’s two greatest religions.</p>\n<p>A character who makes sympathetic noises in all the right places, or who is a follower of Sigmar, may be rewarded by a priest forgetting himself for a moment, and letting slip the news that Stolz is setting off for Altdorf after the Carnival, to put his case to the Emperor in person. This is clearly very sensitive information, and careless talk only make matters worse. This news should also lead them to realise that if anything is to be done about the tax changes, it must be done before the end of Carnival week.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>GM OPTION: DROPPING NAMES</em></h3>\n<p><em>A visit to the Temple of Ulric offers the GM a chance to have the Characters meet two NPCs — one is destined for greatness, the other for notoriety — but at present they are still relatively obscure. For the players, a chance meeting with a character whose name they recognise can make a lasting impression.</em></p>\n<p><em>If you prefer not to use these characters, or to save them for another point in the campaign, that is quite permissible. They might be posted to temples away from Middenheim at the moment, eagerly awaiting the promotions that will bring them back to the City of the White Wolf, and one step closer to making history.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Temple Of Shallya</h3>\n<p>The Characters are able to encounter junior priests fairly easily, but need a good reason to gain an appointment with the High Priestess, @Actor[3LymwsbJMdZVMfgd]{Isolde Begegnen}.</p>\n<p>Here, the priests denounce the Temple Tax openly: it is taking money which would have helped the poor and sick, and putting it in the Graf ’s coffers. The Dwarf and Scroll Taxes are aimed at some of their more generous contributors, making matters worse. The temple is simple, and clearly keeps little of the money it receives — unlike some.</p>\n<p>The temple of Shallya also resents Ar-Ulric’s lack of action — he is supposed to represent all temple interests in court circles, and has clearly failed them on this occasion. Some Sigmarites have over-reacted badly, accusing Ar-Ulric of plotting with the Graf to get rid of them: this is clearly ridiculous, since the Temple Tax affects the temple of Ulric as much as any other in the city.</p>\n<p>The Characters might come here if they need healing, so Isolde Begegnen’s profile is given below: she may or may not treat injured Characters in person, but her profile indicates what is available if they are in serious need.

As his former nanny, Hildegarde has modest influence with Graf Boris (1 vote).</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Hildegarde is almost always with the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess,’} living in adjacent rooms at the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{palace}. Like her charge, she is not easy to meet, but she does attend a few Carnival events, one or two on her own. She favours high culture, and exotic events such as fire-breathers and singing frogs.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Males with Fellowship scores below 40 will never win her approval: there is no point even rolling dice.</p>\n<p><strong>Elves</strong>: +5 to all Fellowship Tests. She likes their refined nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: –10 to all Fellowship Tests. She finds them coarse.</p>\n<p><strong>Halflings</strong>: +5 to +10 to all Fellowship Tests, if enthusiastic about cookery — Hildegarde is proud of the cakes she serves at afternoon tea, which she makes herself.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Hildegarde’s main role is to make it difficult for the Characters to meet with the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess,’} especially alone. Considerable ingenuity may be required to get her out of the way for a little while: an irresistible distraction (singing frogs, for example), or the rumour of one, might induce her to leave her charge (who detests slimy creatures) for an hour.</p>\n<p>Hildegarde knows much about the city, and the Graf ’s family, but only in the form of personal anecdotes. Much of what she thinks she knows is laced with unreliable gossip. Her tales might be used to foster suspicions that may be helpful or not, depending on how the adventure is progressing.</p>\n<p>She is very protective of the family, and faced with a plausible argument that some danger threatens the Graf, she may be swayed.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Hildegarde has commended the @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Knight Eternal} to the Graf many times, and is convinced that he has some influence. She refuses to believe that the Graf listens to any Lady at Court.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Hildegarde’s main goal is to protect the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’} from unworthy men — which, in her opinion, is all of them. She is fiercely loyal to the Graf, whom she virtually reared: any threat to him, real or imagined, will stir her to formidable action — but she will never forgive being misled or exploited.</p>\n<p>She dislikes the Temple Tax, likes the Dwarf Tax (‘such coarse folk’), and cares little about the Scroll Tax. These are not strong feelings, and she regards politics (especially taxation) as somewhat sordid.</p>\n<p>She is appalled by @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}, and would love to see him banished. She finds him far too forward and is not comfortable with him being around the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’}. (See below for more details.) She casts aspersions on the legitimacy of his qualifications, but the real reason for her utter contempt for him is his vulgar flirtation. She may insist that the Characters discredit him in exchange for any help from her — and she will demand a detailed plan and regular progress reports. This may create problems for the Characters, since Luigi may be crucial to de-hypnotising @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} — not to mention that he is a source of precious influence with Graf Boris.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Hildegarde  dislikes him, and may imply that he filches from the Treasury. Since he is nervous whenever the two meet, she has not noticed his recent twitchy behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: She approves of his manners, but is a little snobbish about his humble origins. She is happier now that he is engaged to be married, and therefore poses no threat to the ‘Princess.’</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: No strong feelings, though she dislikes his moodiness. She does not know that he harbours feelings for Katarina.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — The ‘Princess’</strong>: Utterly devoted to her, protective, and blind to all her faults, save that she is a little headstrong at times. </p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Has no dealings with them at all, and can scarcely recall their names.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Has always thought him too soft in matters of public morals and decency. Increasingly suspicious of his obvious anxiety, she distrusts him for no reason she can name. She knows nothing of his affair with the Graf ’s paramour.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ybdS4Z0pbWL8oiND]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Regards them all as ‘loose women’, cuts them dead socially, and refuses to discuss them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: A formal relationship characterised by elaborate manners, largely restricted to superficial exchanges at court functions. He seems like a fine young man, if a little slow.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Knows him only slightly; vaguely likes him for his excellent manners, but disapproves of his ‘gadding about town.’ Knows him to be loyal, honest, and fair.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Has never heard of the man, and does not discuss merchants and commerce.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Hildegarde has protested loudly and often to Graf Boris that this appalling man should not live in the same building as the Princess. Luigi once made indecent advances to Hildegarde — a joke on his part, though Hildegarde does not appreciate the irony.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Approves of their grave and dignified demeanour, but thinks they should stop fiddling with taxes and draft some useful laws to restore public morals and decency — preferably with public floggings.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer:</strong> The Chaperone would never entertain the idea of conversing with a criminal such as Rothbert. She might change her mind if she realised he knows about her nephew @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Sees Breugal partly as a kindred spirit, and partly as a rival for her self-appointed position as the court’s arbiter of etiquette and genteel behaviour. She secretly relishes their contests of etiquette, which both regard as something like a duel against a worthy opponent: each of them believes they have the lead in this ongoing contest.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Zimperlich respects the High Priestess’s position, but thinks she’s too subtle in her religious teachings on the law. The Chaperone considers it fairly easy to work out who is guilty and what fate they should suffer. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>Zimperlich has some respect for Isolde, as she behaves just as a Shallyan should. She also supports the princess’s involvement in a worthy cause like the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya}. Zimperlich would rather not get too close to the temple if she can avoid it, because she’s not particularly partial to grubby orphans or smelly poor people. </p>\n<h3>Deadly Secret: A Black Sheep</h3>\n<p>Hildegarde has a shameful secret: her younger sister died in childbirth, and she raised the child herself. Her nephew, @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl}, turned out very badly (see @JournalEntry[mNMoXXZJKYGjXH7O]{The Harmacist}). While she has cut all ties and will never mention him, she feels guilty for how he turned out, and fears disgrace and scandal if their relationship should become known. </p>\n<p>If the secret is discovered, the Characters might take advantage of it, but they will need to be subtle. For example, they might mention in passing that they have discovered that someone at court has a young ne’er-do-well for a relative — not that they would ever gossip or name names, of course. Overt attempts at blackmail will alienate her completely.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, <em>@JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{A Knight’s Midsummer Dream}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Dwavern Valley Choirs}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Elven Lightsingers}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants and Jousting}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 1)}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 2)}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/hildegarde-zimperlich.webp","folder":"So1PdVn4b7FXXZLo","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"aqoGepFk4QsiiGWq","name":"The 'Princess'","content":"<p>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</p>\n<p>‘Princess’ Katarina is very difficult to meet or have an opportunity for a chance encounter. She is escorted in public by a large contingent of Knights Panther and guarded in private by her @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Chaperone}.  If the Characters have befriended @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} the Minstrel, he may invite them to a small, private party, which the ‘Princess’ might attend for a half-hour or so. If Rallane likes a good-looking and cultured Character, he strives to distract the Chaperone’s attention for five minutes to facilitate a conversation. The Character had better have some good lines ready or be a great raconteur! Katarina is easily distracted, but responds well to stimulating conversation or intriguing gossip. </p>\n<p>Some players might think that the best place to approach Katarina is at the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}, but this is not so. The event is formal, and she knows that many eyes are on her; she is introduced to so many people that no one individual really has a chance to make an impression; and there is no opportunity for a private conversation. The best opportunities are at the @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets} and the @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}, especially if @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} and her other friends can distract @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde} the Chaperone for a few minutes. Katarina’s visit to the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya} on Backertag to engage in some solitary reflection may also provide an opening.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Katarina won’t introduce anyone to her father, because he is unwell, and should not be disturbed. Likewise, the Characters cannot use her to see @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan}, because @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} has given strict instructions that he should avoid all excitement. If the Characters convince her that they can help her brother, she introduces them to Pavarotti so that he can make the decision. She can introduce the Characters to @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}, especially fellow Elves, and may provide an introduction to @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}. An introduction to @Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} is tricky: while Katarina has considerable affection for her chaperone — coupled with a healthy dose of frustration, of course — and would normally be happy to help anyone respectable to make her acquaintance, she worries that taking younger, handsome, and especially male characters to see the chaperone could lead to uncomfortable questions about how they met, and why Hildegarde is only learning about their acquaintance now.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/katarina-todbringer.webp","folder":"IOqzzXGRK0YmZ3sY","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":500000}}}
{"_id":"asPugKqKMUhH3837","name":"Claw Mark","content":"<p>The following encounter takes place at night, as the Characters are walking through one of the more pleasant parts of the city. Ideally, they should have a good deal of their equipment with them, as they will have no time to go and pick up anything left in their lodgings.</p>\n<p>As they are strolling through a particularly dark and quiet street, the door of a house suddenly bursts open and a young man, dressed only in his night-clothes, rushes out yelling,<em> ‘Help me, someone, please!’</em></p>\n<p>As he catches sight of the party, he turns and races towards them. A large bruise covers one side of his face. As he rushes over, gasping for air, a dark shape appears, silhouetted in the doorway of the house. The man gasps out one last sentence, <em>‘They’ve got my father… Don’t let them take him… Hurry…’</em> before an audible twang comes from the doorway, followed by a much closer thud.</p>\n<p>The unfortunate young man collapses into the arms of one of the Characters (perhaps one who is drawing or who has already drawn a missile weapon of their own), choking and coughing up blood. A crossbow bolt is buried in his back.</p>\n<p>The shooter is a Yellow Fang cultist by the name of Peter Tavelli, ordered to stop Ernest from raising the alarm while Skretth’s minions took his captured father away through an old, forgotten stone passageway that travels into the house through a flagstone in the cellar.</p>\n<p>Tavelli retreats back inside the building and watches the Characters’ reactions through the hall window. The Characters are likely to chase Tavelli into the house, remembering the urgency of the dying man’s last words. If they pursue, Tavelli leads them into a trap in the house before trying to get back to the cellar and the secret passage. If he is caught or cornered, he swallows a capsule of concentrated @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.JbSjlgUdzsl5ok95]{Heartkill} containing four doses of the poison. It may not kill him, but even so his fanatical loyalty to his cult and to the Skaven ensures that all Tests to make him talk are <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong>.</p>\n<p>If particularly cowardly adventurers refuse to enter the house, the adventure can be brought to them. The Skaven are very interested in capturing the party, since they are the only (living) people who know what happened to Klauss. They may be grabbed during the night and thrown into the cells in the sewers (see @JournalEntry[7yPxqLqUFRNauqHG]{Into The Sewers}, below) to await sacrifice.

{"_id":"bbeiTuz6fIj4hObn","name":"The Right Road","content":"<p>The journey to Middenheim is a long one, and involves a perilous crossing of the Drakwald. Our ‘heroes’ may decide that there are more attractive, and safer, opportunities elsewhere, or they may simply have missed all the hints and leads pointing them that way. You can use various means to nudge them in the right direction.</p>\n<h3>Urgent Delivery</h3>\n<p>In ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.p6uoMs09lyIar8qc]{Carrion up the Reik}’, the Characters were hired by Matthias Blucher to deliver a cargo to a Captain Scharlach in Middenheim, and warned that it must arrive by the start of the city’s famous Carnival. They have received an advance on the payment, but can expect nothing else unless they fulfil the contract.</p>\n<p>Acting on orders from Matthias, perhaps a clerk from the Bluchers’ Altdorf office meets their boat when it arrives. He or she asks the Characters about their journey, inspects the cargo (especially the seals), and offers to guide them to the depot of @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.HqarwMVLyiaal4sK]{Castle Rock Coaches}, where tickets have already been booked for the whole party. A number of burly porters (treat them as stevedores, armed with crowbars instead of boat hooks) stand ready to take the crate and the rest of the Characters’ luggage, and have been well paid to make sure that everyone and everything makes it on to the coach.</p>\n<h4>A Cargo for Marienburg</h4>\n<p>If, through some mischance, the Characters have managed to keep both their boat and the supposedly valuable cargo for Marienburg (see ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.Xv6S9PboyVCs9a8h]{Making a Deal}’), and you have not been able to destroy either in a fire at the docks, the Blucher agent inspects the cargo on the wharf and opens one crate to find that it contains nothing but low-grade earthenware, which was intended to be destroyed in the fire that Blucher arranged to damage the Characters’ barge. The Altdorf agent may or may not already know about the deception, but in either case he tells the Characters that there was a mix-up and this cargo is not the one destined for Marienburg. However, he does have an urgent overland delivery for Middenheim, and is prepared to pay well if the Characters deliver it before the city’s Carnival begins.</p>\n<h3>The Trail Of The Purple Hand</h3>\n<p>Since they came across  Kastor Lieberung’s body  in ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.eSfUKiIYJM8nlFmT]{Mistaken Identity}’ in Enemy in Shadows, the Characters have run across the Order of the Purple Hand in Altdorf and Kemperbad. They should have at least one letter (@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.tUuxwr64dr2BqUBC]{Handout 10 from Death on the Reik}), which indicates that the cult’s leadership is in Middenheim, and they should also have formed the impression that until the matter of ‘Kastor Lieberung’ and his inheritance is resolved, the cult will not stop harassing them. Given the cult’s apparent reach, their only hope — slender as it is — may be to go to Middenheim and confront the cult’s leaders. If your group has played through both <strong>Enemy in Shadows</strong> and <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>, you may well find this to be the most expedient method of getting them to Middenheim. The Purple Hand has done much to make enemies of the Characters, and at this point your players may well be champing at the bit to confront the cult directly. If you think this likely, have a Character catch a glimpse of a purple-hooded figure leaving the Blucher offices, or otherwise allow the relationship between the Bluchers and The Purple Hand to become known. A quick interrogation later, and the party should be on its way to Middehiem, intent on confronting one ‘Captain Scharlach’ in person...</p>\n<h3>The Last of the Wittgensteins</h3>\n<p>While in @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.DlryCob4PW1jm9s0]{Castle Wittgenstein}, the Characters may have found a letter to @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.fmUd7AtbJckbiWo6]{Lady Margritte} from her brother @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard}, telling her all about the wonderful time he is having in Middenheim with his fellow Slaanesh worshippers. Of course, the prospect of tracking down one man in a city of thousands seems daunting, and the Characters may need some extra help and encouragement to follow up on this lead.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the trail of the Purple Hand is clear enough, in which case the discovery of Gotthard among Middenheim’s high society can be a surprise — but if the players need an additional incentive to get them to Middenheim, here are some ideas.</p>\n<p>Gotthard’s letter mentions ‘important and influential people flocking to the cause’, which implies that there is a Slaanesh cult in the city with some very high-ranking members. Having seen the temple of Slaanesh in the castle, the Characters may decide to go to Middenheim in order to investigate further.</p>\n<p>It is clear that the whole Wittgenstein family is more or less corrupt. The letter makes it plain that Gotthard is  just as bad and corrupt as @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.fmUd7AtbJckbiWo6]{Lady Margritte}. The mere implication that he is a worshipper of Chaos may be enough for more devout Characters to hunt him down and end the Wittgenstein line once and for all.</p>\n<p>A picture of Gotthard was hanging in Castle Wittgenstein’s @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.1wRb1a5Tku2t0UvL]{portrait room}. In the painting he is wearing a distinctive jewel, which the Characters are certain they would recognise if they saw it again.</p>\n<h3>The Warpstone</h3>\n<p>The Characters have encountered Skaven at least twice during <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>: once at the @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.Byapyp2Y5uE49deo]{Devil’s Bowl}, and a second time when they snatched the Warpstone from @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.dJH6EMHCGKMTsHel]{Castle Wittgenstein} and brought the whole structure down to cover their escape. No adventurers worth their salt forget this kind of frustration, and they may be determined to track the Skaven down and stop whatever they are planning to do.</p>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;transform:scaleX(-1);border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/end-of-wittgenstein.webp\" width=\"269\" height=\"330\" /></p>\n<p>They may rue this decision once they become embroiled in the events of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, but for now their desire for the Warpstone, and their frustration at the loss of it, can be used as a further incentive to direct them to Middenheim. As the Characters make their way toward Kemperbad and Altdorf — or wherever else they may be going — they may hear further rumours from the north. In addition to more reports of anti-Sigmarite atrocities in Middenland, there may be talk of ratmen beneath the city (see @JournalEntry[ri289tDcFl3qOsaT]{‘News and Rumours’}], and perhaps of an unexpected rash of mutations in the city.</p>\n<p>As the Characters discover later, the Skaven who took the warpstone meteorite from Castle Wittgenstein did not go to Middenheim. But for now, they have not heard of Skaven being anywhere else, and that may be enough to convince them to go there.</p>","folder":"tp4QvOHx22sG8xK2","sort":250000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":250000}}}
{"_id":"btauTcLqGuv0bZG2","name":"Minor Carnival Encounters","content":"<p>Life during Carnival is hectic, with many possibilities for incidents and encounters to complicate the Characters’ lives. A few possibilities are presented here, to be used at your discretion. It is recommended that the time spent on minor encounters should be limited: if the Characters have to spend too much time on unrelated encounters, they may not be able to complete their investigation, and gain the influence they need to resolve the situation before the end of Carnival Week.</p>\n<h3>Yokel Baiting</h3>\n<p>‘Yokel baiting’ is a tradition of the first day of the Carnival. Despite their seeming friendliness, Middenheim’s residents  are unable to resist having a laugh at some poor visitor’s expense. The term yokel is used to describe anyone not born and bred in the city. In past years, the event has seen some very dark escapades, including the mock public execution of a Bretonnian merchant for dropping litter. Unfortunately, as the executioner sharpened his axe (a dummy affair made of <em>crystal-sugar</em>), the poor man died of fright! This year marks the return of an old favourite: the ‘Pickpocket Gag’.</p>\n<p>The ‘pickpocket’ selects a victim from the crowd, then  making it obvious that he or she has just stolen something, runs off, usually with the victim in hot pursuit. The chase ends in the @JournalEntry[asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials} (location 3) where the item is returned as the crowd cheers and jeers. It is rare for the pickpocket to be caught, since only fast and nimble young citizens are chosen (with Dodge skill scores of 55 and Talents such as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.jrFIFLhyOYwcyMUl]{Flee!}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.E3vTSCzgrasNijUO]{Fleet-Footed} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.BbStIySkF1hDM2zq]{Lightning Reflexes}).</p>\n<p>By tradition, the pickpocket is dressed in a brightly-coloured costume; this ensures that pursuers will not lose sight of him or her, and that Middenheimers will recognise the pickpocket and make way, joining in the fun by tripping up the victim and getting in the way. If the pickpocket is caught, the Watch is called. In the past, this has resulted in the pickpocket being released on the grounds that it is a ‘first offence.’ Only when the victim reaches an apoplectic rage is the joke revealed.</p>\n<p>If a player character is chosen as a victim for this event, run the chase according to the @JournalEntry[SRetBgvMulRRIQQq]{rules}, but whatever the Character rolls for movement, assume that the pickpocket rolls the same or better.</p>\n<h3>The Troll Slayer</h3>\n<p>This incident can be set in any public place. If the Characters need some help in locating the source of @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Sparsam’s} addiction, it can give them a chance to find out about @JournalEntry[mNMoXXZJKYGjXH7O]{the Pit}.</p>\n<p>The Characters see a tattooed Dwarf with orange-dyed hair heading towards them. He walks in a straight line, with the crowd parting fearfully round him. As he approaches, the Characters may notice on a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test that he seems unusually agitated, even for a Troll Slayer. His facial muscles are contorted in a strange spasm, and his bulging eyes seem unnaturally bright. If the Characters move to one side, the Dwarf walks on without pause. If his path is blocked, he stops and stares at whomever is in the way. After a moment, he stretches his muscles, and hefts his axe in a warning manner. Even under the influence, Glugnar will not attack an unarmed person — however, if the Characters decide to draw their own weapons or attack first, the Troll Slayer will be only too pleased to oblige them with a fight.</p>\n<p>@Actor[7qgDlG8BryDHpn4a]{Glugnur - the Troll Slayer}</p>\n<p>Glugnur is in Middenheim to take part in the @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}, so this encounter might take place near the @JournalEntry[eM2ZiVNgS7dzI2bA]{Bernabau Stadium}. While affected by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald's Delight}, he is happy to fight anyone who gets in his way — including a fellow Dwarf. However, should a Dwarf show proper respect, and move aside, Glugnur will greet him as a brother, and invite him to celebrate in style. The stimulant has given Glugnur a tremendous appetite, and he is about to embark on an eating binge. After the binge the dose wears off, forcing Glugnur to sleep for the next 12  hours. If asked about the source, Glugnur simply says ‘the Pit,’ and continues eating.</p>\n<h3>The Protection Racket</h3>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;transform:scaleX(-1);border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-shakedown.webp\" width=\"375\" height=\"565\" /></p>\n<p>This encounter can be set in any commercial or market area which is not far from lower-class areas, the slums or the Old Quarter. As the Characters turn a corner, they see a small market stall kicked over by two brutish young men in leather jerkins. The elderly pedlar and his wife shake with fear as the thugs advance, brandishing clubs: they have refused to pay protection money, and are about to suffer the consequences.</p>\n<h3>The Victims</h3>\n<p>Victims are an unfortunately common class of person in The Empire, especially during Carnivals and other events that draw out a crowd. Gustav and Hildi, below, are quite unexceptional, except in the unwanted attention they have drawn.</p>\n<p>@Actor[swyabCA6Zxh16jw1]{Gustav Holschtweig}</p>\n<p>@Actor[YWqaDFC1SFXjTNYL]{Hildi Holschtweig}</p>\n<h3>The Thugs</h3>\n<p>Equally as unexceptional are Anton and Bruno, who make their money shaking down unwary vendors, wayward travellers, and anyone else who seems to be a likely target.</p>\n<p>@Actor[IUWpCVVM1IishjiP]{Antonia Fiegling}</p>\n<p>@Actor[OTkq0jLTBOWVhYBb]{Bruno Hansgorp}</p>\n<p>If the Characters threaten Antonia and Bruno, they laugh humourlessly, then Antonia strikes Gustav in the face. If the Characters do nothing, the thugs beat Gustav up, and then search for money. If the Characters attack, Antonia and Bruno defend themselves, but flee if reduced to 3 wounds or less.</p>\n<p>The merchants will be deeply grateful for the Characters’ help. The crowd will applaud, and look rather shame-faced. If one (or more) of the Characters gives some money to the merchants to recompense them for damage done to their goods, you should consider making an extra, individual experience point award.</p>\n<p>A Watch patrol arrives some 5–10 minutes after the fracas, and takes statements from all concerned. If the thugs have been killed, the Watch is  suspicious of the Characters, but testimony from @Actor[swyabCA6Zxh16jw1]{Gustav} and other witnesses clear their names. However, the sergeant warns the Characters to watch their step for the rest of their stay in Middenheim — not that they want to discourage public-spirited actions, but it would be better if criminals are caught rather than killed. In any event, the action will be reported to @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Commander Schutzmann}. When the Watchmen have departed, Gustav insists on buying a meal for the Characters, leaving @Actor[YWqaDFC1SFXjTNYL]{Hildi} in charge of the stall. He takes them to an average standard inn (prices as @JournalEntry[ieHrUyFz83TkBikg]{The Templar’s Arms}).</p>\n<p>If the thugs escape, the party might be in for a surprise a few days later. With four accomplices, @Actor[IUWpCVVM1IishjiP]{Antonia} and @Actor[OTkq0jLTBOWVhYBb]{Bruno} arrange an ambush in some dark alley. All the thugs wear masks. By this time, the Characters may be deeply involved in the main plot, and assume that the attack has another motive altogether.</p>\n<h3>The Street Brats</h3>\n<p>While walking through a busy market-place, the Characters hear a cry of, ‘Stop, thief !’ Looking round, they see a street-urchin running towards them. Behind is a Halfling pie-seller, intent on recovering a pie that the lad has just stolen. A few yards from the party the urchin trips, tumbling into one of the Characters. He bounces to his feet, but by then the Halfling has caught up.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<p>‘Wot’s the matter wiv you, mister? (or lady),’ <em>says the lad calmly, taking a bite out of the pie to render it unrecoverable</em>. ‘My mates ’ere’ll pay for the pie.’ <em>He looks significantly up at the party, ready to bolt if they refuse. </em>‘Name’s Karl,’ <em>he says</em>. ‘Pleased t’meetcha.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the party sides with Karl, they gain a useful ally. An acute observer, he quickly realises that they are Characters, new to town. He plays up to them, flattering their vanity, and feigning great awe, while pointing out that he could be extremely useful: ‘Fanks, guv’nor, ye’r a gent. Anyfink I can do in return? Show you the sights, p’raps?”</p>\n<p>As Karl explains, he would happily work for nothing, but he has to support his four friends: Uli Muller, Gunnar Kammerer, Carina Adenauer, and Claudia Dietz — <em>‘After all, they depends on me, see? Gotter look out fer yer own.’</em></p>\n<p>All are shabbily-dressed orphans, with profiles similar to Karl’s, and a similar range of basic Skills. They are observant and cunning, and could be very useful as spies and errand-runners. If the players don’t think of this, have Karl drop a few hints: ‘Anyfink you need to know, guv’nor, look no further. It’s mazin’ wot a bit o’ silver does fer the eyesight an’ memory.’ <strong>Note</strong>: they would stand out like a sore thumb in any well-to-do area. ( Karl will point this out if necessary — with the air of one explaining to a very small child.) </p>\n<p>However, they do know a great many servants, labourers, bar staff and the like. They are a close-knit group, and work together or not at all.</p>\n<p>Their services are not expensive; they will ask for @Pay[3bp]{3 brass pennies} each per day, but can be bargained down to @Pay[1bp]{1}. They will, however, claim extra fees, if they report something which clearly interests the party. Karl insists on payment in silver — if offered gold, he will say, <em>‘D’yer fink yer could break that inter small change fer me, guv’nor? Wouldn’t want anyone finking I’d pinched it.’</em></p>\n<p>If the Characters hire Karl and his friends, you can determine what information they can supply to advance the adventure. If the party simply hands Karl over to the Halfling, a few sling-stones might come their way at a later time.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-shakedown.webp","folder":"3FmEzDwm1adAgzPx","sort":165625,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 5: The Carnival","sort":165625}}}

If they suspect that the encounter has been staged by the Knight Eternal, a few minutes of conversation should convince them this cannot possibly be cunning… could he?</p>\n<p>The key to Siegfried’s good graces is his naïve vanity. If the Characters are, or can pretend to be, impressed by his position, devoted to the ideals of chivalry, and sufficiently well-born to merit his attention, they can flatter him into almost complete pliability.

{"_id":"dCsWSFaugK8jTpoW","name":"Initial Inquiries: Religion","content":"<p>Having heard various rumours on the way to Middenheim, the Characters may well try to learn more about the growing tension between the cults of Sigmar and Ulric.</p>\n<h3>The Sigmarian Heresy</h3>\n<p>Every Middenheimer, and almost everyone in Middenland and the north, has at least heard of the heresy — or as most Ulricans call it, ‘the controversy’. Put simply and shockingly, it proposes that Sigmar’s divinity is second to Ulric’s — if it even exists at all! They argue strongly that Sigmar was mortal and only became Emperor with the Ar-Ulric’s  blessing. It was only after his disappearance that Sigmar became a god. They conclude from this that Sigmar is less divine than Ulric, more of a warrior saint than a true god.</p>\n<p>Theologians have grappled with this conundrum for centuries, with many heated debates at various councils (in particular, the Council of Nuln and the Council of Tilea): warrior saint, demigod, or deity? Until recently it was regarded more as an exercise in logic — a paradox for students and initiates to study — than as a serious indictment of the Empire’s most powerful religion. But now, a growing and vocal faction of fundamentalist Ulricans has begun to embrace it, claiming that it calls into question the legitimacy of the Emperor’s rule, and that of all Sigmar’s successors.</p>\n<h3>The Sons of Ulric</h3>\n<p>The @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{Sons of Ulric} are a loose and disorganised confederation of religious fanatics, northern separatists, bigots, and thugs bound together by the common belief that a blood descendant of Ulric ought to lead the official cult. It is no surprise then to learn that many prominent Sons of Ulric go so far as to claim to be blood descendants of Ulric themselves, and invoke their supposed ancestry to justify acts of sedition and violence. The group has no overall leader, central organisation, or coherent agenda.</p>\n<p>There have been a number of activities attributed to the Sons of Ulric, including calls for the north to separate from the more Sigmarite south, breaking the Empire into two separate nations. Discrimination against followers of Sigmar ranging from refusing to do business with them to attacks on their temples, homes, and persons is on the increase. Other factors that add to the rising tensions are advocating for laws and taxes that target followers of Sigmar specifically; civil disobedience toward officials from Altdorf; and blaming them for any crime, disaster, or public mishap. They have little love for the official cult, saying that it is weak and that Ar-Ulric ought to be chosen from their own ranks.</p>\n<p>Ar-Ulric has publicly called for calm and tolerance, and the group is technically banned from holding assemblies in Middenheim, but he has stopped short of criticising the group’s anti-Sigmarite stance — something that followers of Sigmar see as significant. The Graf has condemned the growing lawlessness and violence, and has increased taxes to pay for more watchmen, but he has not disavowed the Sons of Ulric or taken any action against them specifically.</p>\n<h3>The Grand Theogonist</h3>\n<p>A few weeks ago the @Actor[Grand Theogonist], the leader of the Sigmarite faith, visited Middenheim for talks with the Graf and Ar-Ulric. Although this is not unprecedented in itself, he was accompanied by a much larger escort than usual, which included witch hunters as well as Templars of the Fiery Heart.</p>\n<p>The Characters may have encountered the Grand Theogonist and his entourage on the road, and have probably  heard of the recent activities of Sigmarite witch hunters in the city. The presence of such a strong force, and the witch hunters’ high-handed actions, caused considerable tension; although a strong Watch presence was able to prevent riots. Sons of Ulric have criticised the Graf for meekly allowing this Sigmarite force to enter the city freely and do as it pleased.</p>\n<p>Followers of Sigmar are more conciliatory. They are grateful to the Grand Theogonist for coming to Middenheim, and to the Graf and Ar-Ulric for meeting with him. Although no official statements have been made about their discussions, the leaders of Middenheim’s Sigmarite community still hope for a peaceful resolution to the growing religious tensions — though some less optimistic souls are packing up and heading south toward Altdorf, counting their blessings (Sigmar’s or Ulric’s) to be free of whatever reckoning is certain to visit Middenehim soon.</p>\n<h3>North And South</h3>\n<p>The religious tensions have a significant regional dimension, going back to the tribes that Sigmar united to create the Empire, more than twenty-five hundred years ago. The cult of Ulric is the most powerful religion in the northern provinces, which were the territory of the Teutognens. Sigmar’s faith is strongest in the southern homeland of his Unberogen tribe, centred on Altdorf and the Reikland.</p>\n<p>If they are Reiklanders, the Characters — the Humans in the party, at least — have almost certainly grown up with a degree of suspicion regarding those from other provinces. In Middenheim, they discover that they themselves are outsiders, and regarded with suspicion. It quickly becomes apparent to them that the Sons of Ulric are using regional differences as well as religious ones to justify their activities.</p>\n<p>Even those Middenheimers who do not agree with the rhetoric and violence of the @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{Sons of Ulric} may privately admit that they may have a point when it comes to the question of north versus south. They may point out that there are many differences beside religion: northerners are hardier and less flighty than southerners; northern culture places more emphasis on personal integrity while southerners seem to regard profits as a legitimate justification for anything.</p>\n<p>All of this, of course, is thinly disguised regional prejudice, which every Middenlander has to some degree, even if they are not consciously aware of it. If pressed, a great many Middenheimers admit that they would prefer for the Emperor to rule the south and @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} the north as co-regents. But a vocal minority claims that complete separation from the Empire would save the north so much in taxes that everyone would enjoy unprecedented prosperity, including the @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{Sons of Ulric}.  </p>\n<h3>Refugees And Atrocities</h3>\n<p>The followers of Ulric and Sigmar have very different views on this subject, as might be expected. Most Ulricans believe that the reports of attacks on Sigmarites in Middenheim have been exaggerated, if not completely fabricated. @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{The Sons of Ulric} maintain that they are lies spread by agents of the Emperor to justify a planned invasion of the north. The ultimate goal  of this planned invasion is to replace the Graf with an @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.S7O7WxLJKfgPvnZW]{Imperial Plenipotentiary} from Altdorf in the role of viceroy, abolishing the post of Elector Count and bringing Middenland — and ultimately, the whole of the north — under the direct rule of an Emperor who would be accountable to no one.</p>\n<p>While most Middenheimers believe that the numbers of Sigmarite refugees fleeing Middenland have also been exaggerated, some think the count may be accurate, and even take pleasure in the thought that these ‘southerners’ — for all that many are Middenheim born and bred — are leaving the city to the true Ulricans who belong there.</p>\n<p>By contrast, every Sigmarite in Middenheim has a story to tell. Some, especially those who have come from out of town for the Carnival, report no more than occasional rudeness or jostling. But resident Sigmarites disagree with this entirely. They have either experienced discrimination or violence directly, or know someone who has. Tavern brawls and back-alley beatings have escalated to bricks through windows and daubed slogans; one or two suspicious fires have broken out in Sigmarite-owned homes and businesses; and everyone knows at least one family that has packed up and moved south.</p>\n<h3>A Dark Motive</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{The Temple Tax} and the tax on priests entering the city have the greatest impact on the city’s religious community, and @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} has made sure that @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} supports them.</p>\n<p>The followers of other gods are outraged, and there are rumours — especially among the city’s Sigmarite community — that Ar-Ulric not only supports the taxes but suggested them, as part of an organised effort to force other religions out of the city: his cult has amassed great wealth from the city’s faithful and visiting pilgrims, and can outlast any of the others.</p>\n<p>If the taxes are another weapon in the growing religious strife, then the Graf must be in favour of the suppression of other religions. It seems possible that they may be a prelude to other measures against Sigmar and Altdorf, culminating in the outright secession of Middenheim, Middenland, and much of the north. The Characters cannot be sure until they know more, but with the stakes potentially so high, they must find out the truth.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">'RESTORING THE NORTH’ </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">OR ‘TAKING BACK CONTROL’</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">A vocal minority state that in order to make Middenheim glorious again, the following need to be addressed. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">The burdensome regulations on trade cost the north a fortune </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">in lost business.<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Altdorf places the interests of the south, and the Reikland in </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">particular, over those of the rest of the Empire.<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Customs charges on luxury goods from the south would </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">generate enormous revenue while not affecting the average northerner at all, enabling the Graf to lower Middenheim’s taxes to almost nothing.<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Southerners and those of foreign lands in general, are </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">flooding into the north at an unprecedented rate, taking jobs, forcing housing prices up, and dominating commerce to an extent that wil soon reduce true-born Middenheimers to an underclass in their own city.<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">The controversial new taxes are only necessary because the Graf has to send so much money to Altdorf in taxes.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wolf-hole-shrine.webp\" width=\"616\" height=\"486\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wolf-hole-shrine.webp","folder":"Ve1StDqEHdnywAsd","sort":525000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 4: Initial Inquiries","sort":525000}}}

Before running this adventure, it is advisable to read @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{The Jade Sceptre: A GM’s Guide}.</p>\n<h3>The Jade Sceptre in Middenheim</h3>\n<p>The followers of Slaanesh in Middenheim have seen more auspicious times: like other Chaos cults in the city, they have suffered from the rise of the Purple Hand. However, the cult of the Jade Sceptre is active enough, and the schemes of one member in particular should provide the Characters with plenty to think about.</p>\n<p>The most active cell revolves around a small group of wealthy young rakes who style themselves ‘The Deviants and Decadents’ .This inner circle has a surprising amount of political influence, if it should choose to use it, although not as much as the Purple Hand can bring to bear. Still, the Jade Sceptre could become a significant power in the city if its members looked up from their excessive indulgence long enough to formulate a plan. So far, they have not. Recently, a more ambitious member has joined their ranks.</p>\n<h4>Gotthard von Wittgenstein</h4>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard von Wittgenstein} is the last remaining member of an ancient but little-known Reikland family. The von Wittgensteins had risen to prominence in the service of the Empress Margaritha in the 1980s (Imperial Calendar), but since then they have sunk back into obscurity. For one reason or another (but mainly because each succeeding generation was developing more and more mutations), none of the family had left their barony for more than seventy years.</p>\n<p>Gotthard was bored in the family's crumbling castle, tired of the same old faces (and beaks, and tentacles): his sister spent all her time hunched over dismembered corpses; his brother was obsessed with taxidermy; his mother was completely deranged; and his father looked more like a giant cockroach every day. Eventually, he could bear it no longer.</p>\n<p>Although, rather surprisingly, they had yet to receive a call from the Witch Hunters, the von Wittgensteins had developed a rather unsavoury reputation among the riverfolk who passed beneath their towering castle. Mutants seemed more numerous in those waters, to say nothing of corpses. He had developed a correspondence with a friend in Middenheim, who hinted at dark pleasures that he knew he would have to experience for himself.</p>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard von Wittgenstein} arrived in the city a few months ago, and through the influence of high-ranking cult members and his own boundless energy and ambition, he rose quickly. Under the assumed name of Gotthard Wallenstein, he became not only the Chairman of the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild} but also the Convenor of the @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, giving him considerable power over the city’s economy. So far, he has only used this power to line his own pockets and those of his friends, but he has something special planned for the last night of the Carnival.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/festival-of-fine-ales.webp\" width=\"297\" height=\"397\" /></div>\n<h3>Gotthard’s Plan</h3>\n<p>As readers will gather from <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, Carnival week is a raucous time, when the normally dour Middenheimers let loose and enjoy themselves. People come from all over the Empire to join in the festivities: it is a time of spectacular parties, and monumental hangovers. This year, the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild} has announced that on the last night of the Carnival, it will pay for every fountain in the city to flow with wine instead of water. Although Gotthard believes the idea was his alone, it was in fact subtly suggested to him by the Law Lord (and Purple Hand leader) @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}, who thought it a good way to blunt public outrage at the new taxes he is forcing through, while simultaneously focusing attention on the merchants rather than the Law Lords. Such a display of conspicuous wealth, coupled with a few well-placed rumours, will promote the idea that the merchants are somehow behind the new measures, or at least that they are profiting handsomely from them.</p>\n<p>Unknown to Wasmeier, @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard}— who is completely ignorant of Wasmeier’s plot or his status as a member of the Purple Hand — has added a further detail to the plan. He has obtained a huge quantity of a drug known as @Item[VWTPVAGlcFf48qCX]{Estalian Mosca}, a powerful stimulant rumoured to fuel many wild parties, and plans to spike the free wine with it. For the last night of the Carnival and most of the following day, Middenheim will become one vast revelry, a tribute that will surely attract the notice of Slaanesh and may even lead to the city’s fall.</p>\n<h4>Preparations</h4>\n<p>Through cult contacts in Marienburg, @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard} has obtained three barrels of @Item[VWTPVAGlcFf48qCX]{Mosca}: a huge quantity, representing tens of thousands of individual doses. Brought into the city under the cover of the hundreds of barrels supplying the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales} at the @JournalEntry[UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{Great Park}, Gotthard inspects the barrels when he visits on Wellentag around 1 p.m. Having marked the barrels in question, he goes about his business while one of his trusted agents, a dissolute lass named Addic, will ‘buy’ the ‘ales’ in question and have them delivered to a restaurant and tavern in the @JournalEntry[ibTyizgEbQHzSzTf]{Neumarkt}-@JournalEntry[UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor} district called the @JournalEntry[yzJ1UAQ911qMCndY]{Templar’s Downfall}, ostensibly to add to their stock. From there, the schemers decant the drug into empty wine bottles, which are ‘delivered’ in cases of twelve bottles to various warehouses around the city, where the wine purchased by the Guild is stored. It takes several days for the cult to spike all of the wine, but everything should be complete in time for the promised filling of the fountains on Festag evening.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wine-barrels.webp\" width=\"542\" height=\"343\" /></div>\n<h3>The Best-Laid Plans</h3>\n<p>As simple as this plan is, there are a number of things that can go wrong, tipping off the Characters that something sinister is afoot and prompting them to investigate. Here is one example.</p>\n<h4>A Simple Mistake</h4>\n<p>If they are at the @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales} between noon and 1 p.m., the Characters come upon a commotion at a beer tent with a sign outside reading <em>‘J. Thijksson, Marienburg’</em>. If the Characters investigate, they see several employees and bystanders struggling to hold steady a clearly intoxicated Carnival-goer spewing an increasingly incomprehensible stream of colourful lanauge. The drunkard is raving in the language filthy enough to make a state soldier blush, and when brought outside the tent turns his vitriol first towards a series of horrified patrons who seem to know him, then to a nearby tent pole, a rain barrel — anything within earshot.</p>\n<p>A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test (+10 for Physicians, Spies, or anyone else who has practical knowledge of drugs and poisons) reveals a strange, glazed look in the drunkard’s eyes, a flush in his face, and profuse sweat running down his forehead and cheeks, quite out of keeping with the weather. Others may make an <strong>Easy (+40) Intelligence</strong> Test to observe that it is very early in the day for anyone, even a seasoned drinker, to be as drunk as this man seems to be. At that exact moment, his eyes start almost out of his head, his whole body is wracked by a tremendous spasm, and he falls down dead with blood leaking out of his eyes, ears, and mouth.</p>\n<p>Questioning the staff and bystanders turns up that the man came into the tent with his fiancée and a number of friends and relations from both families. He ordered a beer, took one sip, and spat it out with an oath, saying that it was not beer at all. The embarrassed tent staff took the barrel off and were in the process of tapping another one when the drinker apparently went insane.</p>\n<p>If the Characters try to locate the barrel, they are pointed to one at the side of the tent that turns out to be empty, and seems perfectly normal. An observant bystander may be able to tell them that the drinker was served from a barrel marked only with a plain looking label, but the empty barrel bears a familiar brewers seal, as do all the others that the Characters can see.</p>\n<p>The unfortunate drinker was accidentally served a full tankard of @Item[VWTPVAGlcFf48qCX]{Mosca} by a staff member who is not in on the plot, and one swig was enough to cause a fatal overdose. One of the tent’s staff, an intermediary for the @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{Jade Sceptre}, hurried it out of sight in the curtained stock area at the back of the tent before the Characters arrived, which is where it should have been all along. The three barrels of Mosca are hidden among almost a hundred others, stacked at the back of the tent to serve the day’s drinkers, and the Characters are not permitted to interfere with the stock: the staff call the Watch if they persist in investigating the inventory.</p>\n<p>No matter how they try, the Characters are unable to find anything wrong with the beer sold in the tent. If they try to claim that the tent’s beer is poisoned, they are thrown out; any complaints to the Watch are met with polite skepticism and a promise to investigate ‘in due course’. This, naturally, never happens.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are still at the tent at 1 p.m., they see Gotthard arrive, although they may not know who he is. He seems to be just another well-to-do festival-goer until, mug in hand, he motions one of the staff to one side. A <strong>Hard (–20) Lore (Chaos)</strong> Test or a <strong>Difficult (–10) Lore (Slaanesh)</strong> Test leads a Character to recognise a Jade Sceptre hand sign in the exchange of gestures. After a whispered exchange, he goes through into the stock area, emerging about thirty seconds later, finishing his drink, and carrying on with a circuit of the festival. Along the way, the Characters may be able to see him nod to a disreputable-looking woman — Addic — in passing.</p>\n<p>If they watch the tent, Addic arrives an hour or so later with a donkey-cart and three hired guards, loading up the three barrels and driving to the @JournalEntry[yzJ1UAQ911qMCndY]{Templar’s Downfall}. The Characters have a chance to intercept the cart at this point, although the Watch will not look favourably on anything that seems like attempted robbery, especially if the guards — a sensible precaution for anyone moving drink across the city during Carnival week — are injured.</p>\n<p>Once in the Templar’s Downfall, the barrels are safe from anything less than a full-scale assault. Secure in the cellar, the drug is decanted. If they are still watching the place at noon the following day, the Characters see several crates of bottled wine being loaded on to a cart for delivery to the Merchants’ Guild, but they will not see any barrels leaving and they will not know that anything is wrong with the ‘wine’.</p>\n<p>If the Characters manage to sneak or force their way into the cellar of the @JournalEntry[yzJ1UAQ911qMCndY]{Templar’s Downfall} before the process is complete, they find it crowded with @JournalEntry[TzLOTKnYCmflK3aO]{Jade Sceptre cultists} who attack any intruders on sight. They outnumber the Characters by at least three to one, and are desperate to ensure that no word of their activities gets out. If the Characters manage to get into the cellar after noon on Aubentag, they find the three marked barrels, all empty. It takes a <strong>Hard (–20) Extended Trade (Apothecary) </strong>or <strong>Trade (Poisoner) </strong>Test with 8 required SLs to identify the rapidly drying residue inside the barrels as @Item[VWTPVAGlcFf48qCX]{Estalian Mosca}, with each roll requiring about five minutes of examination.</p>\n<h4>What Now?</h4>\n<p>Even if the Characters have realised what is going on, and have followed the trail from the @JournalEntry[yzJ1UAQ911qMCndY]{Templar’s Downfall} to the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}, they will not simply be able to storm in and expose the plot. The Guild, and @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard} as its Chairman and Convenor of the @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission on Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, have too much clout for a wild accusation from a group of adventurers from out of town to be taken seriously.</p>\n<p>If they decide to take action themselves, they will have to track down all the tainted wine before it reaches fountains all across the city, and either take it or destroy it. Neither course is likely to endear them to the thousands of people who are looking forward to free wine, and the results could range from a mob beating to a full-blown riot.</p>\n<h4>Oh, What A Night</h4>\n<p>The rest of this adventure is left to the GM, based on the Characters’ actions so far, the contacts they have made within the city, and how they decide to deal with the problem. At the GM’s option, the city may indeed see a night of unbridled havoc if they fail, perhaps accompanied by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.8gG2Wim6wAlJWRax]{Daemonettes} appearing here and there.</p>\n<h4>The Daemon Drink</h4>\n<p>Alternatively, some other power may step in and save the day. For example, a faction of hard-line temperance campaigners (possibly led by one or more flagellants) might lay siege to the @JournalEntry[yzJ1UAQ911qMCndY]{Templar’s Downfall}, denouncing it as a den of iniquity and making it impossible to move the tainted barrels to the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}. They might gather outside the guild house, making it impossible to take the wine to the fountains, or they might attack the fountains themselves.</p>\n<p>Sigmarite flagellants, of course, might cause a riot simply by their presence in the city, so perhaps the protests are led by a priest of Ulric — possibly a @JournalEntry[GkT1arSV9rYhYvrG]{Wolf-Kin} — who was granted a vision warning of a threat to the city from the wine. </p>\n<p>In any event, the protest devolves into a series of riots as townsfolk and visitors exchange harsh words, improvised missiles, and blows with the protestors. The situation continues to spiral out of control until the Watch has to intervene in force, which might prevent them from being somewhere else at a crucial time.</p>\n<p>For an added layer of complication, the protestors might include some followers of Khorne from a local cult (such as the @JournalEntry[Xd2AagAWwGfO3N3s]{Crimson Skull} — for the Blood God and the Prince of Pleasure are implacable enemies). The two cults will fight it out under cover of the riots.</p>\n<h4>In Vino Verminous</h4>\n<p>To add to the confusion even further, the Skaven might steal the tainted wine to help in their attack on the city at the end of which will occur during <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. Bottles or cases of the wine are planted in the kitchens of the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, the @JournalEntry[2Ey13dReriX0OnZY]{Wizards’ and Alchemists’ Guilds}, and other selected locations, to lower their defences and make it easier for the assorted and sometimes conflicting Skaven plans to come to fruition.</p>\n<h3>Ending the Adventure</h3>\n<p>The adventure ends when the plot has been thwarted, or when the fountains begin to flow with the tainted wine. The Characters may have learned more about the cult of the @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{Jade Sceptre} and @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard von Wittgenstein}, and they may know that he is the last of the von Wittgensteins, living under an assumed name. They may have earned themselves some leverage with a major figure in the city, just in time to make use of it in the plot of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. Although Gotthard’s influence is limited, every little helps!</p>\n<p>If things have not gone well, the Characters will not only have failed to stop the attack on the city, but wasted precious time. They will have some catching up to do if they want to thwart the greater plot of Karl-Heinz Wasmeier and the Purple Hand.</p>\n<p>For total success in this adventure — the plot foiled and Gotthard exposed or turned into a tool for the Characters to use — each Character should be awarded @Exp[100,Foiled or exposed Gotthard's Plan]{100 Experience Points}, with the usual bonuses for bright ideas and good roleplaying. For partial success or failure, reduce the awards in proportion to the party’s achievements.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wine-barrels.webp","folder":"S7FLDHVd3EvKK0o9","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Cameo Adventures","sort":200000}}}
{"_id":"efYPFvLrN0nHN2tq","name":"The Short Version","content":"<p>The highly respected Law Lord @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier} is secretly a member of the Purple Hand cult. As part of the cult’s scheme to destabilise the Empire, he plans to turn the fortress-city of Middenheim into a secret bastion of Chaos. First, though, he needs to get rid of the key elements of Middenheim’s defences.</p>\n<p>The city’s Dwarf community is large and long-established; they helped build the city’s defences, and still keep the undercity clear of threats. The city’s priests and wizards also play a major role, both in strengthening the city’s fortifications, and in identifying and eliminating threats. Wasmeier’s new taxes focus on all of these groups, with the aim of driving them out of the city for good.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{The Taxes}</p>\n<h3>The Graf</h3>\n<p>The recent death of his second wife has affected Graf Boris deeply. Normally a vigorous and strong-minded man, he has sunk into a deep depression, and is incapable of making any decision or discussing the city’s affairs. Between his grief and the succession crisis — Baron Stefan, his only legitimate heir, is unfit to ascend to the throne — he does not know what to do. Wasmeier saw his opportunity, and began working to push the taxes through.</p>\n<h3>The Law Lords</h3>\n<h4>@Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich}, @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Hoflich}, and @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}</h4>\n<p>Of course, Wasmeier was only one of three Law Lords. The other two could veto his proposed taxes, so he found ways to deal with them. The upright and incorruptible Joachim Hoflich was secretly murdered, and replaced by a Doppelgänger, a shapeshifting creature that Wasmeier coached to imitate him. To control the erudite and thoughtful Reiner Ehrlich, Wasmeier kidnapped Reya, his beloved niece, and made it clear her safety was dependent on Ehrlich’s cooperation.</p>\n<p>The Law Lords always present a united front when advising the Graf, so Wasmeier was able to oppose the new taxes in public — conveniently directing suspicion away from himself — while manipulating his two colleagues into overruling him.</p>\n<h3>The Chancellor</h3>\n<p>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} did not need such drastic action: he is always in favour of any measure that raises more money. However, Wasmeier was glad to learn of the Chancellor’s weakness for certain alchemical powders, and is using this knowledge to keep Sparsam's support for the taxes from wavering in the face of a public backlash.</p>\n<h3>The High Priest</h3>\n<p>As the head of the cult of Ulric, the high priest @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} has considerable influence over the Graf. Wasmeier worried about this, as well as Ar-Ulric’s opposition to the taxes, especially the @JournalEntry[2DCz2QXP6TwBQwip]{Temple Tax} — until his agents uncovered a secret that would place the powerful priest in the palm of Wasmeier’s hand. For some time, Ar-Ulric had been carrying on a secret affair, in violation of his vow of celibacy. Best of all, the affair was with @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}, the Graf ’s paramour.</p>\n<p>Armed with stolen love-letters that could destroy Ar-Ulric’s career and might even see him executed for treason, Wasmeier knew he could control the priest — and that the Graf ’s paramour would also exert her influence on his behalf, rather than see the affair exposed.</p>\n<h3>The Graf’s Champion</h3>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} is a popular figure around Middenheim. Whilst his duty to defend Boris Todbringer in judicial combat is largely a ceremonial one, he is still regarded as the doughty and honourable champion of the city as well as of the Graf. An ambush was laid in one of Dieter’s favourite watering-holes, and he was kidnapped and hypnotised. He has no memory of the event, but now he finds himself speaking out in favour of the new taxes whenever they are mentioned.</p>\n<h3>Other Major Npcs</h3>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} judges — quite correctly — that these steps have given him enough influence over the Graf to ensure that the taxes will be passed. The other major NPCs have not yet formed any opinion on the matter, although Wasmeier is watching them closely.</p>\n<h3>The End-Game</h3>\n<p>At the time of the adventure, @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} effectively controls the @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf}, and through him the city. However, his control is fragile: if any one of his victims should turn on him, all would be lost. Therefore, he plans a daring and brilliant coup to cement his control.</p>\n<p>The first month’s taxes are due at the end of Carnival week. At this time Wasmeier expects resistance from Dwarfs, wizards and priests will be at its strongest: there may be an exodus from the city, or an outright refusal to pay.</p>\n<p>On the last night of the Carnival, the Doppelgänger is to replace the Graf. To everyone’s relief, this ‘Graf ’ rises from his prolonged grief, furious at the way things have spiralled out of control. Learning that @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Hoflich} and @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich} were in favour of the new taxes, he summons them to his office. The Graf ’s messengers find Hoflich’s rotting body in his apartment under his desk. </p>\n<p>On the desk they discover a note bearing an address where @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric’s} love-letters can be found. After this discovery, the following events will occur swiftly at the Doppelgänger’s commander: news of Ar-Ulric’s and @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle’s} affair is leaked, leading to public scandal; Ehrlich is dismissed, but kindly, given the pressure that was brought to bear on him, and Wasmeier is the only Law Lord standing. Reya will be handed over to the Ordo Novitiae of the Nuln cell of Purple Hand, who will induct her into the worship of Tzeentch.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterward, the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} dies in an ‘accident’ involving a particularly strong dose of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald's Delight}. Evidence that he was the ‘hidden hand’ behind the whole plot is found among his papers. The ‘Graf ’ appoints @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} as Chancellor, and he begins appointing allies and puppets to all the vacant posts, including the three Law Lords. Middenheim’s defences, already weakened by the taxes, are  allowed to run down, and when the attack finally comes, the Purple Hand seizes control of the city, turning it into a bastion for the advancing forces of Chaos.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE END IS EXTREMELY NIGH</em></h3>\n<p><em>It is possible, though not desirable, for the events of The Enemy Within to continue should Wasmeier's plan come to fruition as detailed above. The Horned Rat, part four of the campaign, will remain quite playable as is, but Empire in ruins, part five, will require some ingenuity on the part of the GM. While the Characters can claim no true victory without the possibility of failure, be aware that Middenheim's fall to the powers of Chaos will present a challenge not just for the Empire, but for the GM as well.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"aBfHQxuCZtZmIndI","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 3: The Evil Plot","sort":-100000}}}
{"_id":"fALyYCJ98j2qX4oS","name":"Nice Teddy...","content":"<p>This incident takes place during the day, while the Characters are wandering through any area where they are likely to encounter an entertainer — @JournalEntry[6Lr7N7BpeiqOSla3]{Initial Inquiries} gives more information on this. An entertainer stands on a street corner playing on her flute while a dancing bear shuffles comically to the music. It wears an iron collar attached to a chain looped through the piper's belt.</p>\n<p>A small crowd has gathered, including a number of street urchins who jeer and play dares to see who will go closest to the animal. One of them throws a stone, hitting the bear in the eye. With a bellow of pain, it lunges forward, snapping the chain taut and pulling the piper off her feet. The crowd scatters as it advances on the stone-thrower, dragging the struggling piper behind it.</p>\n<p>By the time the Characters are able to do anything, the bear has trapped the urchin in a corner, and the piper is still unsuccessfully struggling to regain her feet. She is shouting to the bear to stay still, but without effect.</p>\n<p>The bear has a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.KtYgLHcSLpHmnGI2]{standard profile} but its Movement score is reduced to 3 due to dragging the piper. Characters with a higher Initiative score than the bear must still make a successful Initiative Test in order to act before it can attack the cornered urchin. You should also make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Initiative</strong> Test for the piper at the beginning of each Round, based on a score of 31. On the first successful Test, she regains her feet and starts using her Animal Training Skill (45) to calm the bear, provided it is not in combat. If any Character attacks the bear, it cannot be calmed down unless it is first successfully distracted (see below). </p>\n<p>The Characters have a number of options apart from simply standing by and watching the terrified urchin be shredded.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/bestiary/bear.webp\" width=\"248\" height=\"232\" /></div>\n<h3>Attacking</h3>\n<p>The Characters can attack the bear and try to kill it — this is probably the least satisfactory option. Although it saves the urchin and perhaps many others, the piper is not happy about losing her livelihood!</p>\n<h3>Distraction</h3>\n<p>Secondly, they can try to distract the bear long enough for the urchin to escape. If the Characters try this, make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Willpower</strong> Test for the bear. If it fails, it is distracted long enough to allow the urchin to escape. However, it is still angry, and attacks the nearest Character unless it can be calmed with a <strong>Charm Animal</strong> Test opposed by the bear’s <strong>Willpower</strong>. A single SL on the Opposed Test is enough to calm the bear long enough for the piper to regain her senses and pacify her friend.</p>\n<h3>The Chain</h3>\n<p>The Characters can take hold of the bear’s chain and try to pull it away. Only Characters who make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test can summon the courage to do this, but the Test may be attempted once per Round until successful. Make an Opposed Test using the total Strength scores of the Characters pulling on the chain, and the bear’s Strength of 55, repeating each Round until successful. This draws the bear’s attention, allowing the piper to calm it.</p>\n<h3>Charm</h3>\n<p>A Character can calm the bear down on a successful <strong>Average (+20) Charm Animal</strong> Test. If the Characters fail the Test, the attempt counts as a distraction (see above).</p>\n<h3>Magic</h3>\n<p>A spellcaster might try to save the day with magic. While the bear is too large to be affected by the Petty spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.gQ14yfwjfcJgNpMp]{Animal Friend}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.4ePe5oNQakA8nJlk]{Sleep} might be useful, as might @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.WeIdAA7KArjUZfyH]{Entangle} or the Lore of Beasts spells @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.FaHVRxdljzqklNTC]{Beast Master} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.gwnNz34Rh0jW4WmF]{Beast Tongue}. Resourceful Players will be able to come up with many more ideas.</p>\n<p>The best spells to use are those that can calm, subdue, or entangle the bear quickly. Wounding spells might be effective, but most enrage the bear further, forcing the Characters to kill the bear. The Characters receive no thanks from the piper who has just lost her star attraction. Spells and miracles with an area of effect risk wounding the urchin as well as the bear, and possibly the nearer bystanders.</p>\n<h3>Resolution</h3>\n<p>The entertainer might make for an interesting contact if she is happy with the Characters’ resolution. She has regular dealings with the @JournalEntry[vcw9pxNsMoxkTbRV]{Low Kings’} thugs and dealmakers and has heard whispers of Chaos cults operating within Middenheim. The extent of her knowledge is up to the GM, but she freely shares it for the Characters’ help.</p>\n<p>If the Characters kill the bear, the urchin runs off at the first opportunity, and any attempt to prevent this is met with a kick in the shins. The urchin escapes automatically, and the kicked character must make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Willpower</strong> Test or spend one Round hopping and cursing.</p>\n<p>Each Character who participates in any action that leads to the urchin getting away should receive @Exp[30,Helped the urchin get away]{30 Experience Points}. This award is halved if the bear is killed, and at the GM’s option Taal may decide that the Character is due some Sin points. Characters who manage to subdue the bear without harming it receive @Exp[50, Subdued the Bear with no harm]{50 Experience}.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/animal-training.webp","folder":"S7FLDHVd3EvKK0o9","sort":406250,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Cameo Adventures","sort":406250}}}
{"_id":"fIoZadIapQhCoKOU","name":"Watch The Birdie...","content":"<p>This incident could be used almost anywhere in the city, but is perhaps most effective either in a market area or wherever large numbers of moderately wealthy people are likely to be walking about. The incident takes place in daylight.</p>\n<p>About 30 yards away, there is a sudden blur of action. There is a scream and some shouting, and a bird flies away rapidly, with people throwing stones and other improvised missiles at it. Any Character with an appropriate Skill can identify the bird as a magpie. What do the Characters do?</p>\n<h3>Rushing to Help</h3>\n<p>If the Characters hurry to the scene of the activity, they find a distraught, middle-aged woman from whom the bird has just stolen a jewelled hair-pin, or a furious stallholder from whom it has stolen some small but valuable trinket, or some other victim from whom the bird has stolen something small, shiny, and valuable. By the time they reach the scene, the bird is long gone. If the Characters have failed to make the acquaintance of a major NPC, this could be an opportunity to introduce them — the woman above could be one of the Ladies of the Court, for example.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/magpie-trinket.webp\" width=\"344\" height=\"328\" /></div>\n<h3>Shooting</h3>\n<p>The Characters suffer from the usual –20 penalty for shooting at a Little target. There is time for one round of missile fire from the moment the Characters first see the bird to when it disappears behind a tree or rooftop. The bird is flying fast and fairly low, so the Characters’ shots may endanger bystanders and could cause a panic. In this event, a Watch patrol arrives on the scene in [[/r 2d10]] rounds, and the party may be charged with causing a breach of the peace. If the Characters manage to bring the bird down, they are able to explain the situation to the Watch and may get away with a warning and perhaps a spot fine of a Crown or two. Otherwise, a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test, bribery, or some other means is needed to avoid a heavier penalty: a fine of [[/r 2d10]] GCs and the confiscation of their missile weapons.</p>\n<p>If the bird is brought down and the stolen object recovered, the victim offers to pay any fine the Characters may have incurred, and gives them 5 GCs as a reward.</p>\n<h3>Pursuit</h3>\n<p>If the Characters decide to follow the bird, you may make use of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.03r3y37RFKAFM82c]{pursuit rules}, though unless they can themselves fly they will not catch the creature, merely keep up with it. The bird has an effective Agility of 33 and a Move of 8. Talents such as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.9h82z72XGo9tfgQS]{Excellent Vision} give the usual bonuses. If they manage to keep the bird in sight for 5 successive rounds, they see it fly through a window into the attic of a building several streets away. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) lntelligence</strong> or <strong>Average (+20) Navigation</strong> Test Test is required for the Characters to find the building.</p>\n<p>The building stands a storey taller than those around it, and there is a single door at street level. Going through the door, the Characters find a narrow hallway with doors on either side and a staircase leading upwards. The building is split into apartments, and after two or three landings the Characters reach the door to the attic. The door is locked, but fairly flimsy — a <strong>Challenging (+0) Strength</strong> Test will see it smashed off its hinges.</p>\n<p>Beyond the door is a small attic room furnished with a bed, a table with two chairs, and a small cupboard. A small, wiry, shabbily dressed man of about thirty is sitting on the bed, which is strewn with brightly shining baubles of all descriptions. As the Characters enter the room, a raven takes off in alarm from its perch on the back of a chair and flies out of the window. As soon as he sees that he is outnumbered, the thief surrenders, but he attempts to escape if the opportunity arises.</p>\n<p>If the Characters turn him over to the authorities, they receive a reward of @Credit[17gc10ss]{17 GCs 10/–}, this being 10% of the value of the goods recovered. On the other hand, this thief could be useful if the Characters wish to make contact with the city’s underworld. In either case, a reward of @Exp[25, Discovered the thief]{25 Experience Points} is appropriate for each character who helps the party discover the operation.</p>\n<h3>Further Possibilities</h3>\n<p>The Characters might witness several aerial robberies over a period of time, all in the same general area, until they decide to take action. They could hear rumours of a bird stealing small items of jewellery on a few occasions, or witness a dispute between a stallholder and a shopper who claims that a trinket on the stall was stolen from them a few days ago. The operation can make a good piece of background noise, to distract the players from the main thread of their adventure and to help create the feeling that things are happening in Middenheim even when their Characters aren't around.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/magpie-trinket.webp","folder":"S7FLDHVd3EvKK0o9","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Cameo Adventures","sort":400000}}}

Now — thanks, apparently, to the ingenuity of a merchant named @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.FTT9hoFswIqAW9do]{Matthias Blucher} — the errant Magister is in Middenheim, and almost within the cult’s grasp — but it so happens that the cult’s leaders are preoccupied with an even grander plan.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Hoffen Strasse</h3>\n<p>Hoffen Strasse runs from the commercial Kaufseit district into the menacing @JournalEntry[06LuFlBESLckr28m]{Ostwald} slums (see @JournalEntry[hilEMhOF52SCjG6s]{The City}). The Crossed Keys lies almost exactly on the border between the two districts. It is a four-storey house with a locksmith’s shop on the ground floor, marked by a sign bearing the image of two crossed keys. Like many buildings of this type, the upper floor can be occupied by the shop’s proprietor and their family, or rented out to others.</p>\n<p>As the Characters approach, they can see that both house and shop are boarded up. The shutters are fastened, and planks have been nailed across the doors with symbols of Ulric painted on them: wolf ’s heads, axes, and anti-Sigmarite slogans. The house is clearly empty.</p>\n<p>If the Characters ask locals about the house, one of two things will happen. If they are reasonably discreet and make it sound as if they are merely curious, they will be told about the witch hunters and the previous occupants of the building. If they ask after Captain Scharlach and explain that they have an important delivery for him, they will be met with blank looks: the locksmith was Dieter Schlage, they will be told, and the people who lived upstairs were called Bork. No one has ever heard of a Captain Scharlach. If the Characters persist in asking after him, the Watch may be called and they will have to spend several hours answering awkward questions.</p>\n<h4>The Cruel Truth</h4>\n<p>Two Imperial witch hunters came up from Altdorf, arrested everybody in the house, and had them burned as Chaos-worshippers. As it happens, they were quite correct — with the exception of the unfortunate locksmith (who was unaware of the cultists sharing the building). The house has been searched, emptied of its contents and boarded up.  A merchant named Fuchstun owns the building, and is searching for new tenants, but the place has acquired an evil reputation, and no one has been eager to move in.</p>\n<p>Anybody asking after the building’s former occupants will be suspected of being Chaos-worshippers themselves. The Characters may draw their own conclusions from this: if nothing else, it should persuade them to open the crate and letter, if they have not already done so, and that in turn should give them a good idea about Blucher’s motives in sending them here.</p>\n<p>Captain Scharlach, of course, never existed. As explained on @JournalEntry[hilEMhOF52SCjG6s]{The City}, his name is one of several code-names used by members of the Purple Hand. For example, if someone ever asks for Herr Verandern, it means they are a cult member looking for others. To ask for Captain Scharlach means ‘I have been sent here by another cult member, and I have no idea what’s going on.’</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/skull-spot.webp\" width=\"176\" height=\"173\" /></div>\n<h3>A New Direction</h3>\n<p>As the Characters stand, bewildered, by the empty building — perhaps recalling that a similar building was used to ambush them in Bögenhafen — they may notice that they are being watched. A young guttersnipe, fairly typical for the area, is looking at their crate from across the street, and seems to be trying to decide something. Once any character catches his eye, he ambles across to them.</p>\n<p>‘That for Captain Scharlach?’ he asks, as if it is the least important thing in the world. He cannot read, and will respond contemptuously to anyone who directs him to the large and obvious address label on the crate. If the Characters confirm that they are looking for the captain, the boy nods.</p>\n<p>‘He sent me to watch for you,’ he says, ‘on account of he thought he was goin’ to be livin’ here, but there was some mix-up, and them as was here already wasn’t lookin’ to move out after all. Not till them witch hunters persuaded them otherwise, anyhow.’ If the Characters point out that the house is empty now, the boy snorts in contempt.</p>\n<p><em>‘Just off the coach, are yer? I can tell. What would a man like the Captain want with this place now, with all the neighbours pointin’ an’ whisperin’? ’E’s ‘is reputation ter consider, after all. Come on, I’ll take yer to ’im.’</em> Without looking to see whether the Characters are following, the boy sets off down a side street. If the Characters are late with the delivery, he makes a few choice comments about having had to wait and watch for several days, and observe that some folk have no consideration, what with his time being valuable.</p>\n<p>He tosses these comments over his shoulder as he walks, always several yards ahead of the Characters — by the time they have picked up the crate again, he has a good head start — and after a couple of turns down ever-narrower streets, the Characters turn another corner to find an alley in front of them and their guide nowhere in sight. As they head down the alley, looking right and left for any sign of him, four cultists move to block the street behind them, and four more in front. Each one wears something purple.</p>\n<h3>The Ambush</h3>\n<p>The attackers consist of seven cultists and one cult priest: a Cult Magus, who is with the group that stands behind the Characters. The cultists in front of the party hold crossbows on them, while those behind wield clubs and axes.</p>\n<p>‘<em>Kastor Lieberung</em>!’ the @Actor[iDtTX0rKFDqJA8hQ]{priest} calls out — having never seen the Magister Impedimentae personally, he has no idea which character he is addressing — ‘<em>Come with us and repent before the Magister Magistri, and your companions can live</em>!’ If the Characters do not comply, the @Actor[G3DW990j07OftQut]{cultists} attack.</p>\n<p>It is possible that the Characters can talk themselves out of being shot on the spot, as the cultists are reticent to shoot ‘Kastor Leiberung’ when they are so close to delivering him to the cult’s leadership. His companions, on the other hand, are fair game — as soon as the cult is sure of who Kastor is, they will shoot anyone else who refuses to go along with them. Tales of the slippery Magister and his co-conspirators have spread throughout the cult, and they have no intention of letting him vanish again.</p>\n<h3>Captured!</h3>\n<p>If the Characters lose this encounter, they will be bound and taken to a Purple Hand safe house to await the judgement of the Magister Magistri. As will be seen, however, he is busy with other things during Carnival week.</p>\n<p>During their incarceration in the cellar of an abandoned house, the Characters may overhear their captors speak about ‘the great work’ that is currently underway. They may also learn that the Borks, burned as cultists, were members of the Purple Hand who were assigned to the Hoffen Strasse house to lie in wait for the Magister Impedimentae. The Borks bravely sacrificed their lives without giving up any of their fellow cultists, and the capture of Kastor Lieberung is a tribute to their loyalty. </p>\n<p>The Characters will soon release that no help is coming, so they will have to take measures to free themselves. ‘Kastor’ may be able to talk their way out of trouble, but stealth, cunning, or violence may be called for. </p>\n<p>Be sure not to let too much of the Carnival go by while the Characters linger in imprisonment. If they need some encouragement to arrange a daring escape, have a few members complain loudly about the cost of feeding so many prisoners when Kastor is the only one they <em>really </em>need.</p>\n<h3>The Black And Blue Hand</h3>\n<p>If the Characters defeat the cultists, there will be no further attacks while they are in Middenheim. The whole strength of the Purple Hand in the city is standing by for the news that the Graf is theirs, at which signal they will each perform an assigned task; an assassination here, a house-burning there, and other crimes that will help cement the cult’s hold on the city.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-ambush.webp","folder":"tp4QvOHx22sG8xK2","sort":575000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":575000}}}

Characters who present themselves as kindly or concerned benefit from +10 to Fellowship when dealing with Kirsten — those who present themselves as self interested or malign suffer a -20 to Fellowship Tests.

However, she is worried about the growing tension in court circles.</p>\n<p>Petra is focused entirely on her pursuit of good times and lavish presents.</p>\n<p>Natasha longs to increase her influence, and may pretend to be more influential than she really is.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Kirsten and Natasha ignore him. Petra was surprised when he propositioned her recently. She dislikes him, but thinks he may become a good source of presents. The Chancellor has forgotten the incident, and currently harbours a secret crush on the unknowing Natasha.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Kirsten loves him, but thinks his support of the new taxes is odd — as is his refusal to discuss the matter with her. Petra likes him, but only for Kirsten’s sake: he is a little dull for her taste. Natasha dismisses him as weak for his decision to leave the court.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Kirsten knows him through @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}, and likes him. Petra likes his music, and she has met many useful people at his parties: knowing his romantic nature, she considers him a possible source of future interest. Natasha dislikes him for his frivolity.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘The Princess’</strong>: All three resent Katarina’s condescending attitude: Kirsten responds with irritation; Petra with elegant put-downs; and Natasha with icy coldness.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: Heartily disliked by all of them. Natasha has considering putting poison in her drink.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Few dealings. Kirsten knows them slightly through Dieter, and liked von Genscher after a brief meeting, but is neutral otherwise. Petra is regularly escorted by one or other of them, and is currently toying with von Genscher’s son Anton. Natasha dismisses them, especially since they avoid politics.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: No dealings, except that Petra has enjoyed a few drinks with Deputy High Wizard Janna Eberhauer.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[O1WGhtHQNazslML1]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}: Kirsten</strong> is devoted to Shallya and dislikes the martial cult of Ulric, but has nothing against the High Priest personally. Petra has noticed his recent discomfiture and wonders about him and @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle}, but doubts they would be so stupid. Natasha would like to see his downfall, except that it would mainly benefit the cult of Sigmar, which she dislikes even more.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: Kirsten is somewhat friendly with Emmanuelle, and suspects nothing of her involvement with the Graf or Ar-Ulric. Petra and Emmanuelle have similar personalities and get on well, but are not close; Petra knows about the Graf and wonders about Ar-Ulric. Natasha strongly suspects that Emmanuelle is Graf Boris’s paramour, and is jealous of the power this must give her; she knows nothing of the affair with Ar-Ulric.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ladies at Court</strong>: The Ladies at Court share a certain esprit de corps, and despite their differences are generally reluctant to attack each other. Kirsten and Petra have a superficial friendship. Kirsten respects Natasha, while Petra ignores her. Natasha regards them both as rivals.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Kirsten thinks him harmless and not a bad sort; Petra thinks him a fool; and Natasha despises him for his tedious manner and small intellect.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Kirsten and Petra both like him as a companion about town, and Petra enjoyed an occasional dalliance with him in the past. Natasha dislikes him, taking his open sociability for a lack of discrimination.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Kirsten does not know him. Petra is disgusted by him, having found that he requires ‘favours’ in return for anything — even a drink. Natasha disliked him at first glance.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Kirsten has met him once or twice, and finds him alarming. Petra found his company stimulating but exhausting. Natasha had a brief fling with the man, and was left somewhat bitter by the affair.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: No dealings, although Natasha would like to be closer to such politically powerful men.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer: </strong>Do not know him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Kirstin Jung is careful to be polite to Breugal, but does not know him as a person. Petra Liebkosen thinks him ridiculous, and sometimes cannot resist teasing him in one way or another. Natasha Sinnlich is aware of the subtle power that Breugal wields within the palace — more aware than Breugal himself, in fact — and has begun the long process of cultivating him as an acquaintance.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>As most of the city’s middle- and upper-class weddings happen in the @JournalEntry[bBgwBPu0zugAPooq]{Temple of Verena}, Kirsten approached the priestess to arrange her forthcoming nuptials. She was pleasantly surprised by the Verenan’s welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>Kirsten Jung is a follower of Shallya and values the priestess’s counsel and spiritual guidance.

{"_id":"hilEMhOF52SCjG6s","name":"The City","content":"<p>Dwarfs and Wizards were among Middenheim’s first settlers. Dwarfs were instrumental in building the striking City of the White Wolf, ensuring the foundations they laid were built to last — they don’t let anyone forget their contribution to the city’s solid infrastructure either, ever.  Its imposing architecture shows many Dwarf influences, from the dark-grey uniform stone they quarried tirelessly from the rock below to the intricate knotwork carvings that are visible across the city.  Middenheim is still home to a large Dwarf population, who take immense pride in their continued contribution to the city’s construction. </p>\n<p>Early rulers also encouraged wizards to settle there, valuing their help in both construction and defence — for the Drakwald was even less tame then than it is today. Welcomed by the city’s rulers and accepted by their neighbours, wizards and alchemists flocked to the city, cementing its reputation as a centre of learning and research.</p>\n<p>The sturdy hardwoods of the Drakwald and the dark-grey stone of the Fauschlag, the great plateau of rock on which the city is built, give Middenheim’s buildings a certain uniformity. The city is known for its talented stonemasons and builders, and to a man (and Dwarf ) they take great pride in constructing buildings that last: it is said that there is not one building in Middenheim without a plaque stating who built it and when.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<p><em>A joke from Altdorf makes light of this tradition:</em></p>\n<p>Q: What’s the best feature of a Middenheim building?</p>\n<p>A: It lasts forever.</p>\n<p>Q: What’s the worst feature of a Middenheim building?</p>\n<p>A: It lasts forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Middenheimers retort that Altdorf ’s builders favour style over substance, and like to claim with a deadpan stare that ‘Ours stay up longer!’</p>\n<p>The rock on which Middenheim stands is honeycombed by the mines and tunnels of the early Dwarf settlers. The Undercity is the realm of the Dwarfs, who form a first line of defence against any threat from below.</p>\n<h3>A Brief History</h3>\n<p>Humans of the Teutogen tribe were the first settlers, who reached the top of the rock with the help of a Dwarf clan. Dwarfs have been an important part of Middenheim’s population ever since. The Teutognens built a temple to Ulric at the heart of their settlement.  Over the centuries and millennia that followed, both temple and city prospered and grew. Today, the city of Middenheim covers the whole of the rock, and the Temple of Ulric is second only in size to the great Temple of Sigmar in Altdorf.</p>\n<p>Surrounded by the wild and untamed Drakwald, the City of the White Wolf has come under attack many times, but its massive, Dwarf-built fortifications and its hardy, stubborn people have withstood every foe. The worst attack took place in 1118 IC, on the heels of a devastating outbreak of Black Plague that killed three quarters of the Empire’s population. The Skaven swept across the devastated Empire as soon as the plague abated in 1112 IC, finally coming to a halt at the foot of the Fauschlag. The ratmen besieged the city, turning their most terrible weapons on the city’s fortifications and tunnelling up through the rock beneath it.</p>\n<p>The city’s walls withstood everything the Skaven could throw at them, and Dwarf tunnel fighters held the undercity with outstanding bravery and resilience. The siege failed, and Count Mandred von Zelt mounted a counter-attack. His forces burst out of Middenheim like a thunderbolt, shattering the demoralised besiegers and chasing the Skaven army across the Empire. Every victory brought more people flocking to Mandred’s banner, and by the time he slew the Skaven warlord Vrrnik of Clan Mors at the Battle of the Howling Hills in 1124 IC, the whole of the Empire was behind him.</p>\n<p>Dubbed ‘Ratslayer’, Mandred became Emperor and set about rebuilding the Empire. The skull of the fallen Warlord was wrought into an enchanted helmet of terrifying aspect that remains one of the city’s treasures to this day. Housed safely in the vaults of the Middenpalaz, displayed on a large stone plinth, the skull is a prized relic of Middenheim’s military history. </p>\n<p>When Mandred was assassinated in 1152 IC, the Electors were unable to agree on a successor, beginning a period of uncertainty that lasted for more than a thousand years. Through the Age of Wars, no one dared attack the impregnable fortress-city. When Graf Heinrich was forced out of Altdorf in 1547 IC after declaring himself Emperor — and beginning the period known to historians as the Age of Three Emperors — he naturally retired to Middenheim. The Empire came close to breaking apart, and Middenland might have become a separate state if the western part of the province had not rebelled against Middenheim and declared allegiance to another self-styled Emperor based in Nuln.</p>\n<p>It took an invasion by the forces of Chaos in 2301 IC to reunite the fragmented Empire. Once again, Middenheim survived a prolonged siege, and when Magnus the Pious led his great army there in the following year, the City of the White Wolf became a vital staging-post for the campaign to free Kislev from the Chaos hordes.</p>\n<p>The last two centuries have been comparatively tranquil. Dwarf tunnel fighters and Human sewer jacks still patrol the undercity and deal with the occasional threat. Like his predecessors, the Graf sponsors regular expeditions into the Drakwald to keep its population of beastmen and other monsters from reaching dangerous levels. Meanwhile the city has quietly prospered through trade, pilgrimage, and academic prestige. Trade of metal ore, slate and minerals from the Middle Mountains, flows profitably through the city and out across the Empire. </p>\n<p>Followers of Ulric flock to the city’s great temple from far and wide. Pilgrims in need of sustenance and a place to rest their virtuous heads line the pockets of many satisfied tavern owners, hawkers and stallholders selling cheap mementoes. The city’s traditionally liberal attitude has attracted scholars and wizards, raising the Collegium Theologia from its origins as a school for Ulrican priests to one of the Empire’s great universities.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/skaven-guards.webp\" width=\"250\" height=\"215\" /></div>\n<h3>The People</h3>\n<p>Middenheimers take after their city: proud, hard, and pragmatic. This makes the city especially attractive to Dwarfs — but to outsiders, the people of Middenheim can often appear rude.</p>\n<p>For example, here is a newcomer to the city, asking for directions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Q: Excuse me — sorry to bother you, but I seem to be lost. I wonder, would you be so kind as to direct me to the Royal College of Music?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To a Middenheimer intent on their own business, all the fine speech is redundant. They will be several paces away before the newcomer can even finish the question. If the Middenheimer is in a particularly forgiving mood, the questioner may be treated to a ‘No’ flung over one shoulder in passing.</p>\n<p>Here is how it is done in Middenheim.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Q: Royal College of Music?</p>\n<p>A: First left, second right!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Middenheimers are noted for their love of privacy, and resent intrusion of any sort. This gives the city a quietly liberal air, since most people mind their own business and make a point of not interfering in other people’s affairs. No one has to like their neighbours, but everyone is expected to tolerate everyone else, so long as the favour is returned in kind. This attitude changes during Carnival Week, however, when the city and its people welcome all manner of visitors and take an intense interest in the festivities and revellers alike — but more of that later.</p>\n<p>Middenheim’s large Dwarf community attracts many  Dwarf travellers, either relatives visiting their clan or Dwarfs new to Middenheim but curious to visit the impressive city. They can often be seen wandering the city in family groups, visiting buildings constructed by their ancestors or the ancestors of their relatives. Resident Dwarfs mainly work as engineers, builders, and skilled artisans of other types. Dwarfs have a long and honourable involvement with the city, and this is reflected in the respect they are generally accorded by Middenheim’s other inhabitants.</p>\n<p>The other species feel less at home here. Halflings are the next most common, and generally work as cooks and innkeepers, although the @JournalEntry[oKACPU6FEgy3Yb5r]{Kleinmoot} district is home to a considerable number of Halfling artisans. Middenheim’s culture does not encourage their natural friendliness and love of gossip, so most of the city’s Halflings prefer the company of their own kind.</p>\n<p>For all its friendliness toward wizards, Middenheim is a hard city for an Elf to live in. The stark and unlovely architecture, the large numbers of dour and grumpy Dwarfs, and the prosaic, workaday culture make the city cold and unwelcoming. With that said, however, a few Elves have found very comfortable positions in the households of the city’s upper classes, where their culture and artistic talents are admired.</p>\n<h3>Government</h3>\n<p>Middenheim is ruled by Graf @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Boris Todbringer}. He is supported by a powerful group of advisors and confidants, who are detailed in <strong>Chapter 5</strong>. The Graf maintains direct rule over a radius of some 30 miles from the city proper, and also governs the province of Nordland.</p>\n<p>Under the Graf, several organisations and individuals are responsible for various aspects of the city’s day-to-day operations.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/powers-that-be.png\" width=\"473\" height=\"382\" /></div>\n<h3>The Graf</h3>\n<p>The Todbringer line is very distinguished: its name is recorded in the earliest writings of the Teutogen people. Graf Boris married young, taking the elegant Maria von Richthofen as his bride. One year later, Maria died giving birth to @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan}, the Graf ’s only legitimate child and his legal heir.</p>\n<p>Only a few months previous to Stefan’s birth, the Graf fathered an illegitimate son, Heinrich, with a Lady-at-Court. It has been rumoured that Heinrich was conceived the night before the Graf ’s marriage to Maria.</p>\n<p>A sickly child, Baron Stefan became increasingly distant and quiet  as he grew. Today, he seems to understand little of what goes on around him, and is incapable of coherent speech. He spends most of his time staring blankly into space. Even so, he is the Graf ’s sole legal heir.</p>\n<p>@Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich}, on the other hand, grew into a vigorous and capable young man. The Graf officially recognised him as his son, and gave him a title and lands, but Heinrich is still barred from the succession. He is currently away from the city, but takes a great interest in events there.</p>\n<p>The Graf ’s daughter @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina}, affectionately known as ‘the Princess’, was born to another Lady at Court. Again, the Graf officially recognised her, and granted her the title of Baroness. But like Heinrich, the circumstances of Katarina’s birth bar her from the succession — leaving Stefan as the sole legal heir to one of the highest titles in the Empire.</p>\n<p>For this reason, ten years ago the Graf, then 37, took a second wife: the beautiful Anika-Elise Nikse, daughter of Baron Rudolph von Niske of Nordland. It was no secret that the offspring of this marriage would be heir to Middenheim. Unfortunately, the marriage was unfruitful. Anika-Elise died from a strange illness a few months ago.</p>\n<p>Following her death, the Graf has sunk into a deep depression, leaving more and more of the tasks of government to his trusted advisors.</p>\n<h3>The Todbringer Family</h3>\n<p>What follows is a description of the men of the Todbringer family — 'Princess' @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina} may well play a more important role in the adventure, and is discussed in detail on her @JournalEntry[XY9dT0a5Tin6KKAs]{summary sheet}.</p>\n<p>@Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Boris Todbringer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan Todbringer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich Todbringer}</p>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>As might be expected, the main cult in Middenheim is that of Ulric. In addition to being the High Priest of the city’s temple to Ulric, and the head of the Empire’s second largest religion, Ar-Ulric is an Imperial Elector. The city’s huge @JournalEntry[Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{Temple of Ulric} reflects the cult’s power and prestige within the city. While Middenheimers in general are not especially devout, almost all of them pray to Ulric to look after themselves, their families, and their city.</p>\n<p>Several other cults also maintain temples in Middenheim. Like every other Imperial city and town, Middenheim has a temple to Sigmar — although it is significantly smaller than the Temple of Ulric. Historical rivalries between the two cults — one local, the other national — have reached boiling point over recent months, and followers of Sigmar are not especially popular in the city.</p>\n<p>In addition, the cults of Verena, Shallya, and Myrmidia maintain temples in the city, and there is a shrine to Morr in the great cemetery of Morrspark. The city’s Dwarf community maintains a chapel to Grungni. While there is no formal temple to the Halfling goddess Esmeralda, every Halfling home and business in the Kleinemoot has a small shrine dedicated to her as well as to the spirits of the family’s ancestors.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/eternal-fire.webp\" width=\"624\" height=\"492\" /></div>\n<h4>Growing Tensions</h4>\n<p>Middenheim, and Middenland in general, have always been loyal to Ulric, and its people have always had a stubborn, independent streak that makes them slightly contemptuous of the airs put on by Altdorfers. Some look back with misplaced fondness to the Age of Three Emperors, and dream of an independent Middenland free from southern interference. Although Altdorf stands roughly in the middle of the Empire, many Middenlanders regard everywhere south of the Drakwald as ‘the south’ — a land of undeserved wealth and ease, populated by effete, untrustworthy, Sigmar-worshipping milksops.</p>\n<p>Always a palpable undercurrent in local attitudes to outsiders, in recent years these religious and social differences have grown to greater and more dangerous prominence. While most Middenlanders dismiss the vagaries of ‘southerners’ with a tut, a roll of the eyes, and the occasional pride-puncturing prank, a more militant attitude has been growing and spreading. Middenland separatists, long dismissed as romantic but harmless cranks, have become better organised and more vocal, winning increasing support among the poor and under-educated with their simplistic rhetoric and rose-coloured promises of independence. Carroburg, the southern capital of Middenland, is portrayed as being too close — physically and politically — to Altdorf, and these nationalists look to the city state of Middenheim as the natural capital of ‘free’ Middenland. </p>\n<p>In Middenheim’s streets and taverns, demagogues are speaking out with growing vitriol against southern control, promising that independence will divert endless rivers of tax revenue from Altdorf into the purses of ordinary Middenlanders — so much money, in fact, that the priesthoods of Ulric and Shallya will be able to treat every sick or injured person for free. Middenland will be free to treat with Marienburg, Kislev, and elsewhere, boosting prosperity further. As a result, goods from elsewhere in the Empire will be taxed, and those from other provinces will be banned from the guild membership, ensuring that every true Middenlander prospers.</p>\n<p>‘<em>Middenland for Middenfolk</em>’ has become the slogan for a bundle of policies, embraced with glee by elements of Middenheim’s poor as an excuse to attack and rob Altdorfers, Sigmarites, those of foriegn lands, and anyone else — including more moderate Middenheimers, whom they characterise as traitors and ‘Sigmorons’. The Sons of Ulric, once a tiny group of extremists who no one took seriously, have emerged as an umbrella organisation uniting a wide range of groups ranging from Human supremacists to Ulrican fundamentalists. Its leaders remain obscure, but demagogues and handbills all over the city spread its semi-coherent doctrine of independence, hate, and endless blame.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, the argument has taken on a religious bent. The faceless Imperial bureaucrats whose uncaring decisions keep honest Middenlanders poor — according to the rhetoric, at least — have become identified with the cult of Sigmar, while that of Ulric has become a focus for ‘true Middenlanders’ to rally around. While Ar-Ulric and the priesthood have refrained from entering the debate, militant Ulricans have whispered that Sigmar, born a mortal, is no more a god than Magnus the Pious, and that his official cult is a southern trick to keep honest, Ulric-fearing folk from power. The legendary figure of Mandred the Ratslayer has been invoked as a symbol of Middenland’s glorious past, and a particularly inflammatory rumour claims that his assassination was part of a Sigmarite plot, plunging the Empire into centuries of conflict rather than allowing a northern Emperor.</p>\n<p>Growing in numbers and increasingly organised, the @JournalEntry[PdeeLrg2SZ7RdUrf]{Sons of Ulric} and their affiliates have become bolder. Attacks on outsiders are becoming more frequent, especially outside the city: beatings and robberies have become common, and several bandit groups now fly banners with crudely painted Ulrican symbols as a justification for their violence. Within the city, a ‘truce’ has been declared for Carnival week, so that the world can see the traditional hospitality and tolerance that have long been proud Middenlander virtues. Apparently blind to the inherent hypocrisy, most militants confine themselves to comments and vague threats during this time, and avoid actual violence.</p>\n<p>So far, the city’s government and military commanders have taken no action in response to the growing wave of militancy and religious violence, although it is rumoured that the movement has begun to gain supporters in the rank and file of the Knights of the White Wolf, the largest Templar order of Ulric. It has even been suggested that they may exchange their traditional warhammers for axes, to separate themselves further from the cult of Sigmar, but official sources deny this.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>RUMBLINGS OF WAR</em></h3>\n<p><em>The increasing tensions between the Ulrican north and Sigmarite south will come to a head during the events of <strong>Empire in Ruins</strong>, the concluding chapter of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>. It is vital that this escalation towards a potential civil war in the Empire should feel like a natural outcome of simmering and unaddressed grievances, carefully stoked by individuals and groups with much to gain from  strife and warfare. Be sure to make frequent mention of this tension as the Characters play through <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. While the Carnival is a distraction from worldly concerns, demagogues and agitators can be found on every street corner speaking ill of Altdorf, The Emperor, Sigmar, and the current state of The Empire more generally. Have NPCs pepper in some references to their issues with Altdorf rule, and make sure to mention the graffiti that is cropping up around the city as well as children’s skipping rhymes and other doggerel heard in snippets around the streets. This need not take centre stage, but if you can establish an atmosphere of impending civil strife it will serve you well down the road.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Law and Order</h3>\n<p>Middenheim has a sophisticated legal system, and the practice of law is a profitable one. For this adventure, though, the GM need not worry too much. During Carnival week, many of the normal laws of Middenheim are largely ignored: since so many people converge on the city for the Carnival, the best thing to do with trouble makers is either to lock them up for the whole week, or to expel them on pain of death should they return. The latter sentence works on all but the most persistent miscreants!</p>\n<p>Individual Watch Captains are allowed a large degree of discretion — which some abuse — when it comes to minor disturbances. Provided the Characters do nothing seriously wrong, like insulting the Watch Captain, they should get away from any minor brawls with a simple warning. Of course, manslaughter (even in self-defence) is a serious matter. If evidence or witnesses can back up the party’s story, they escape immediate arrest — but the Watch keeps an eye on them, and further incidents may be dealt with more harshly.</p>\n<p>A standard Watch patrol consists of [[/r 1d10]] Watchmen led by an Elite Watchman. In wealthy areas, the patrol consists of a similar number of Elite Watchmen led by a member of the Knights Panther, the Graf ’s personal fighting force. This is slightly different from normal patrols, but during Carnival time everybody has to pitch in — even the Knights Panther.</p>\n<h3>Districts</h3>\n<p>The map at the front of this book shows the layout and some details of Middenheim. The city is home to stinking alleys as well as broad and leafy avenues, and the tone of a location will match that of the district in which it is located.</p>\n<p>More details on these and other locations may be found in <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</strong>.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[ORygEUMcd9ryf6Ny]{The Palast District}</h4>\n<p>The area around the @JournalEntry[16KsfNTgXYLtRib9]{Middenpalaz} is the most well-kept area of the city. The palace is home to @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris}, and several of his advisors and courtiers. The three @JournalEntry[9QmzxmgtDbdsPiSv]{Midden Marshals} have residences near the barracks either side of the @JournalEntry[asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials}.</p>\n<p>Watch patrols are extremely frequent in this area, and unless they look like wealthy residents the Characters automatically attract attention — so they had better have a good reason for being there!</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[8rK4NSrDXCpSKRSH]{Grafsmund} and @JournalEntry[aFOxMajVoBKRHinu]{Nordgarten} Districts</h4>\n<p>This upmarket neighbourhood is home to the city’s upper crust. Nobles, merchants, master artisans, and others live here in elegant mansions. Local residents include two of Middenheim’s most respected citizens: the Law Lords @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Reiner Ehrlich} and @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}. The third Law Lord, @Actor[SZUt3C2u80GbAlmE]{Joachim Hoflich}, lives in the Palace.</p>\n<p>Ever eager to be seen doing its duty, the Watch is very active here. Most residents prefer not to become embroiled in any disturbance or other incident, calling the Watch rather than dealing with ‘riff-raff ’ directly.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[limbxI1PZjhVzBy8]{The Ulricsmund District}</h4>\n<p>The houses in this upper-middle-class area are comfortable, but smaller than the mansions of Grafsmund-Nordgarten. Notable residents include Deputy Wizard @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}.</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt} and @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} Districts</h4>\n<p>The bustling Altmarkt is home to most of Middenheim’s foodstuff trade, and Halflings are a common sight here. The dark and squalid Altquartier is home to many of the city’s more disreputable inhabitants. Those who venture here are on their own. The Watch only comes here if absolutely necessary, and then it comes in force: at least a double-sized patrol of [[/r 1d10+8]] Watchmen led by two Elite Watchmen and a Watch Captain with the profile of a Knights Panther man-at-arms. Life is cheap here, and the locals kill without a second thought, knowing that dead men (and Dwarfs, Elves, and Halflings) tell no tales.</p>\n<p>Many of Middenheim's Halflings make their home in Altmarkt, in a sub-district known as the @JournalEntry[oKACPU6FEgy3Yb5r]{Kleinmoot}. While they struggle for official recognition, every Middenheimer knows that anyone asking after ‘The Halfling District’ should be directed here.</p>\n<p>Various illicit activities form a large part of the local economy, and one local den of inquity, @JournalEntry[mNMoXXZJKYGjXH7O]{The Pit}, is an important location in this adventure.</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[y4MpfiD6PHBOAdX0]{Southgate} and @JournalEntry[06LuFlBESLckr28m]{Ostwald} Districts</h4>\n<p>The Southgate is a poor but respectable residential area.  Residents are hardened by poverty but share a sense of honour and community. The same cannot be said of Ostwald. It is said to be as dangerous as the Altquartier, although Ostwald footpads generally stop short of killing their victims. Again, the Watch rarely patrols this area, and then only in force. People here keep what they know to themselves, unless they know something they can sell.</p>\n<p>Among Ostwald’s run-down buildings is the lair of @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} and her minions (see @JournalEntry[n2j6nlkc2s2LcieJ]{The Lair of the Pawns}): pawns of the adventure’s villain who will play a significant role in the adventure’s later stages.</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[ZWV1AbhVVbWfbEIz]{Neumarkt}, @JournalEntry[UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor} and @JournalEntry[jGfyLhox6OTD75oi]{Nordtor} Districts</h4>\n<p>Middenheim’s second major market, the @JournalEntry[ZWV1AbhVVbWfbEIz]{Neumarkt} deals in everything except foodstuffs. Locals maintain that if it can’t be found here, it’s probably illegal.</p>\n<p>The nearby @JournalEntry[UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor} is a lower-middle-class residential area, home to many of the city’s junior clerks and other professionals. With vibrant eating and drinking establishments, it draws a wide range of evening visitors. The Graf ’s Master of the Hunt, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}, maintains a residence in this bohemian district. To the north of Osttor is the @JournalEntry[jGfyLhox6OTD75oi]{Nordtor} district, which whilst still broadly respectable, has seen better days. The @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music} was founded here centuries ago.</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[hDeFkdQZ2g2fT0it]{Freiburg}</h4>\n<p>The area around Middenheim’s famed university, the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, is popular with academics, wizards, and priests. Students and artists also throng here to drink, talk (including some discussions that would be regarded as sedition in any other place), and test the patience of their more strait-laced neighbours.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{The Wynd}</h4>\n<p>The majority of houses in this artisans’ quarter are both home and workshop. The population consists mainly of mundane craftsmen such as cobblers and smiths. The residents have a strong sense of community, and hostile visitors may find that a whole street will not mind its own business if one of its traders appears to be in trouble.</p>\n<h4>The @JournalEntry[EwI0966tcHzz44lk]{Westor} and @JournalEntry[9S51a44wvQCES1CR]{Sudgarten} Districts</h4>\n<p>This residential area is popular with priests, since there are three temples here. Residents tend to be slightly more pious than the average Middenheimer, but not uncomfortably so.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[QYipS3tpaNBDgKsN]{Geldmund}, @JournalEntry[ASLyIclZPJ32Od7U]{Kaufseit} and @JournalEntry[t1vYezDY0dOlA2yQ]{Brotkopfs}</h4>\n<p>Together, these three areas form the city’s commercial hub. Most merchants live in the residential @JournalEntry[QYipS3tpaNBDgKsN]{Geldmund} area, and walk to their places of business nearby. One of the larger homes is owned by @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}, the Chairman of both the Merchants’ Guild and the @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission for Trade, Commerce and Taxation} — though he is not often to be found here.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/powers-that-be.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 2: Middenheim","sort":0}}}

{"_id":"iYRSBxiVDDI8Eesv","name":"The Cult of Ulric","content":"<blockquote>\n<p><em>Old Wolf White Back prowls the hills, </em></p>\n<p><em>Belly craving fresh new kills.</em></p>\n<p><em>Bloody Blitzbeil wants him dead,</em></p>\n<p><em>So, it slices off his head!</em></p>\n<p><em>Old Wolf White Back howls out loud, </em></p>\n<p><em>To the cheers of Ulric’s crowd.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Along with Myrmidia, goddess of war, and Sigmar, deified founder of the Empire, Ulric is a warrior god. However, where Myrmidia stands for the science and art of battle and Sigmar for the righteous power to smite evil, Ulric’s domain is honour, bravery, and prowess. He despises cowardice and weakness, and expects his followers to display directness and independence in all walks of life.</p>\n<p>These differing philosophies can cause friction between the cults of the war gods. In particular Ulricans and Sigmarites have, if not contempt, then certainly a suspicion of each other. In most respects the two cults are in accord: both preach defiance of evil and respect might and power. Smaller philosophical differences between them — such as Sigmar’s placing mental resolve above physical strength, or Ulric’s emphasis on self-sufficiency rather than protection — can cause friction, but it is history rather than dogma at the root of the animosity. </p>\n<p>Before the coming of Sigmar, Ulric was the most powerful deity in the Old World. Indeed, it was the High Priest of Ulric who crowned Sigmar as the first Emperor almost 2,500 years ago. For centuries, the cult of Ulric refused to acknowledge Sigmar’s divinity and although most Ulricans now believe that Sigmar is as much a god as any other, sub-sects of the cult hold that Sigmar was nothing more than a mortal hero — and by implication that the entire Empire is founded on heresy. As well as this, the cult of Ulric begrudges the Sigmarites’ three Imperial votes to its one, believing that if any cult is to be prevalent it should be theirs. The most devout Sigmarites in turn are notoriously superstitious, and rarely hold any trust in anyone who is not a dedicated servant of Sigmar. </p>\n<p>In the case of the cult of Ulric, this suspicion is doubled by the Ulricans’ mistrust of the man-god, which, in the eyes of the cult of Sigmar, makes them highly suspect themselves. This mutual mistrust is mostly unfounded and relations between the two cults usually remain friendly, but on occasion the religious differences act as catalysts in other disagreements, turning the smallest bone of contention into a blazing conflict. This is particularly noticeable during Imperial elections, when the votes of the Grand Theogonist and two Arch-Lectors of Sigmar almost always go to the Grand Prince of the Reikland, while the High Priest of Ulric invariably supports an Ulrican claimant.</p>\n<p>Ulric’s relations with the other gods are mostly agreeable. In particular he has allies in Rhya and Taal as fellow deities of nature, and there exist many shrines dedicated to Ulric, Rhya, and Taal as the gods of the seasons. For the most part Ulric is a distant deity with little interest in the affairs of other gods. The cult of Ulric occasionally takes issue with that of Ranald, as the methods of the Trickster God are seen as underhand and dishonourable. There is marked rivalry with followers of Myrmidia, but this tends to manifest in competition and condescension rather than outright hostility.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>BROTHERS IN BLOOD</em></h3>\n<p><em>While not required, more on the Ulrican faith, its church and important sub-organisations and sects can be found in @JournalEntry[gAju4PEyv8GeeJQX]{Middenheim: City of the White Wolf}</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/white-wolf.webp\" width=\"301\" height=\"265\" /></div>\n<h4>Famous Ulricans of History and Legend</h4>\n<p><strong>Skoll</strong>: Legends say that Ulric walked the world in ancient days, doing great deeds and vanquishing heinous foes. In many of these tales he is assisted by helpers or companions, and the most famous of these is a huge spectral White Wolf, Skoll. According to Ulrican tradition, it is Skoll who chases the sun away each winter, and some say that the monstrous White Wolves that prowl the northern lands are his descendants.</p>\n<p><strong>Artur</strong>: Artur was the Teutogen Chieftain who discovered the Fauschlag in –50 IC and founded Middenheim on top of it. He became the nominal king of the Teutogen people and in his youth was seen as the archetype of a brave and fierce Ulrican ruler. He grew cruel and vengeful with age and was slain by Sigmar during the unification of the Empire.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Wulcan</strong>: Ar-Ulric Wulcan was the first to record many of the legendary acts of Ulric, responsible for turning what was up until this point an oral tradition into a consistent lexicon worthy of serious study. In 63 IC he was inspired by a series of visions. He saw Ulric summoning forth the Eternal Fire by smiting the Fauschlag with the butt of his axe, and he ordered Middenheim’s High Temple of Ulric to be built at the site.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Bronnstein</strong>: Trained at the Drakwald College of the Holy Wolf, an Ulrican seminary renowned for the piety of the priests it produces. Bronnstein is feted for displaying the courage and prowess expected of an Ulrican warrior, dying in battle fighting overwhelming foes as a Skaven raiding party attempted to storm the High Temple in 1116 IC.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Herrsher</strong>: He is remembered for the vigilance and dedication he displayed in rooting out evil in the heart of Middenheim itself. In particular he is credited for driving out the Doomlord Dieter Helsnicht in 1207 IC.</p>\n<p><strong>Grand Duchess Ottilia of Talabecland</strong>: Few rulers exemplify the divisions between Ulrican and Sigmarite as much as Otillia. She outlawed the cult of Sigmar in Talabecland and extolled the belief that Sigmar was never anything more than a mortal follower of Ulric. In 1360 IC she declared herself Empress, plunging the Empire into turmoil. Most Ulricans consider her reckless, but hardliners admire her and suggest that she ought to be thought of as the first Wolf Empress.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Krieger</strong>: He is remembered by many Ulricans as a devout and principled man, though others see him as a divisive and reactionary figure. He is remembered for relocating the centre of the cult of Ulric from Middenheim to Talabheim following an invitation from Grand Duchess Ottilia in 1360 IC.</p>\n<p><strong>Horros</strong>: Horros was a monstrous White Wolf who preyed upon the inhabitants of villages near Middenheim before being slain by a knight. To those unacquainted with Ulricans, it may seem strange that they remember the monster but have let the name of the knight who slew her pass from memory. Ulricans often pay great regard to those who force them into hardship.</p>\n<p><strong>Graf Siegfried the Significant</strong>: Siegfried is an inspiration thanks to his decision to declare himself the first of the Wolf Emperors in 1547 IC. Most Ulricans find his example to embody their core values of courage and independence.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Sehrhart</strong>: Another Ar-Ulric known for putting the tenets of his faith into practice by becoming an accomplished warrior. He is said to have personally slain as many as thirty Orcs at the Battle of Kleindorf in 1567 IC.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Franzsson</strong>: A controversial High Priest who accepted the minor Order of the Winter Throne into the arms of the main cult in 1975 IC. Members of the Order of the Winter Throne, known as Ragnarites, believe in depriving people of food in order to prepare for an Ulrican apocalypse. Critics of the order see its precepts as thin justification for wanton marauding.</p>\n<p><strong>Grand Master Kruger of the Order of the White Wolf</strong>: The bold and fierce Grand Master is credited with slaying Vlad von Carstein in 2025 IC. He did not kill Vlad forever though, and was later turned into one of the Vampire’s undead servants by way of revenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Grand Master Giger of the Order of the White Wolf</strong>: This leader of the Knights of the White Wolf contributed to the defeat of the Norse barbarians of Thiafi Swiftaxe in 2198 IC. Grand Master Giger and Grand Master Sechse of the Knights Panther both claimed credit for the success of the campaign, leading them into a long and bitter rivalry.</p>\n<p><strong>Ar-Ulric Kriestov</strong>: Another divisive Ar-Ulric. Kriestov is notorious for casting doubt on the legitimacy of Magnus the Pious in 2302 IC. He later repented of his scepticism, joined Magnus on campaign, and supported his election as Emperor. Many Ulricans regard him as a model of fair compromise, whilst others decry his inconstancy and regard him as a Sigmarite quisling.</p>\n<p><strong>Anraheir</strong>: An Amber Wizard who lived in Middenheim in 2367 IC. He was famed for the innovation of a number of spells and the creation of many magical items. A devout Ulrican, his works are regarded as magical rather than spiritual accomplishments, yet in their wild ferocity they embody his Ulrican heritage. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/ulric.webp\" width=\"290\" height=\"348\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/adherants.webp","folder":null,"sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Cult of Ulric","sort":100000}}}

It did not exist at the time <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> was first written, but it could make an interesting alternative to the @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppelgänger}in that adventure — especially if grognard players are expecting to confront a Doppelganger!</p>\n<p>The Changeling — it is known by no other name — personifies its master's meddlesome, deceptive nature. It is a trickster, concealing some of its plans from even its master — something which Tzeentch finds particularly laudable. It can take the form of other beings, from the tiniest of insects to the most massive of Greater Daemons. No one, save perhaps The Changer of Ways, knows the Changeling’s true form, for it goes cowled and cloaked when in its own shape: perhaps even the Changeling itself has forgotten it. Not only can the Changeling mirror the form of another, it can adopt mannerisms and personalities in so flawless a fashion that even the Dark Gods can be deceived. In all of creation there is only one entity that the Changeling cannot duplicate: the Chaos God Tzeentch himself. The Grand Schemer will not suffer any being to steal his identity, even for a moment.</p>\n<p>Afflicted with a low tolerance for boredom, the Changeling loves to play malicious tricks upon all about him. The Changeling’s handiwork is always obvious after the fact: indeed, part of the prank is to make the victim aware of the deceiver, but impotent to act against them. The Changeling roams wild throughout eternity, causing havoc where it may. Each meddling opens up more possibilities in the Great Game, and Tzeentch watches with amusement as the Changeling weaves his uneven tapestry of disruption. Once in an age, the Changeling might work at the direction of a Lord of Change or some other powerful minion of Tzeentch, but only when the prank takes its fancy and the consequences will be truly spectacular.</p>\n<p>@Actor[tYpH2H0xZ3odU5L1]{Changeling Of Tzeentch}</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>CHANGING WAYS</em></h3>\n<p><em>What are the impacts of using the Changeling in your game? To start, the creature is far more powerful than a @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppleganger}, and is certainly manipulating @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}to further its own goals. The Changeling will abandon Wasmeier as soon as it is helpful to do so, and indeed getting rid of the upstart Magister may have been its intention all along.</em></p>\n<p><em>The fun does not stop there, however. The Changeling may well continue to appear in the Characters lives, impersonating future NPCs at first to study its marks, then to guide them towards its eventual goal — which lies in Altdorf.</em></p>\n<p><em>Of course, what is time to the Changer of Ways and its minions? The Changeling may already have appeared to the Characters in the past, perhaps as far back as <strong>Enemy in Shadows</strong>. Perhaps there never was a Kastor Lieberung — or rather, Kastor was the Changeling all along, made to look like one of the Characters to one day draw them into the terrible machinations of Tzeentch.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/changeling.webp","folder":"mpWIRNA0GpAZupQ9","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Changeling","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"idp5Wb1CqoKl7iev","name":"Gotthard Wallenstein","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/gotthard-wallenstein.webp\" width=\"182\" height=\"257\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>Wallenstein is the Chairman both of the City @JournalEntry[lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Komission on Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, and of the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}. The Komission makes representations to @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords} on all laws that affect taxes, merchants, and trade, while the Guild represents the interests of the city’s merchants. He has maintained both positions (which are technically elected by a semi-democratic process) by a mixture of bribery, extortion, bootlicking, flattery, and threats.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Wallenstein lives in an outwardly modest town house in the @JournalEntry[t1vYezDY0dOlA2yQ]{Brotkopfs} district. It is rather less modest inside, although Wallenstein does not wish to draw attention to his considerable wealth. He is virtually never at home, and after much knocking the door will be opened — on a stout chain — by a hunchbacked servant, Adolphus, who will say that his master is away on business, even if he is in. He is equally hard to find at his various warehouses and businesses around the city. Wallenstein attends some Carnival events, mainly to rub shoulders with the upper classes, and might be encountered by chance amongst merchants in almost any part of the city. He avoids the unsavoury parts of the city, fearing a murder attempt by one of the many people he has swindled.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>No special modifiers, but bribes go a long way.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Wallenstein has a poor idea of who influences Graf Boris, thinking that only the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} and the @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords} have any real sway.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Wallenstein is motivated largely by money and pleasure.</p>\n<p>He likes that the tax changes do not affect the city’s merchants — and, naturally, has told the Guild that this is due to his influence! The Dwarf Tax puzzles him: they are a significant market. He suspects that Rallane has influenced the Graf, perhaps through some magical song; he has heard that Elves can do this kind of thing. He likes the Temple Tax, and hopes to profit if the temples are forced to sell off property and other assets. The Scroll Tax worries him: fewer wizards might mean fewer apprentices and students, who are easy recruits for the Jade Sceptre; on the other hand, smuggling magical equipment into the city could be profitable.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Careful toadying by Wallenstein has created a modest friendship. Delighted to be on good terms with the Chancellor, but considers him lacking in base cunning.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Rather fearful of him; he swindled him for a few crowns over a horse deal some months ago, and now regrets it. Knows his reputation and avoids him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Avoids him, knowing that he is a smart observer (Elves always are) and is friendly with @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘Princess’</strong>: Has never met her. Thinks of her as a simple do-gooder, but indulges in lascivious thoughts about her.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: Knows nothing of her.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Indirect dealings only: is very careful to deal with them honestly.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: No dealings, but he is apprehensive about wizards in general, fearing that they might ferret out his guilty secrets.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Has met him briefly, and has no personal feelings. As a devotee of a Ruinous Power, dislikes the cult of Ulric, but does not see the High Priest as a threat.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: She rebuffed him when she was an actress, and he would delight in her downfall.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Rarely meets them, but behaves in what he imagines to be a courtly manner and tries to hide his baser instincts. Likes to think that they are well-disposed to him, except for the ‘cold, stuck-up’ Natasha.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: No dealings, but he knows his reputation as a fool, and takes pleasure in privately mocking him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Minimal dealings; indifferent.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Wallenstein has regular bi-monthly meetings with them in his capacity as Chairman of the City Komission. Hoflich has been quite friendly lately, and he takes this as a sign that he is growing in influence. He will claim to be friendly with all the Law Lords.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer: </strong>He’s worried about Rothbert and @JournalEntry[CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{‘The Man’}, as they know some of Gotthard’s dubious practices and criminal connections. If he could find a way to neutralise them, he would.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Treats Breugal with fawning politeness when he wants something, but hates and despises him. He has even considered recruiting some of his @JournalEntry[TzLOTKnYCmflK3aO]{Jade Sceptre cronies} to frame the chamberlain in some scandalous way. It would serve him right for being such a po-faced, self-righteous old stick — and what would everyone’s faces look like!</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[KZjUllCfHJl4kZ2F]{Thognar}- The Clerk</strong>: Has met Thognar at a few functions and knows he works at the Kmission. Gotthard has been careful to butter the Dwarf up without actually becoming obliged to him in any way.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Gotthard has no knowledge of her. He associates the @JournalEntry[bBgwBPu0zugAPooq]{Temple of Verena} with wizards and prefers to avoid anyone of that nature.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>He ensured he was seen ‘anonymously’ giving money to the orphanage — to  improve his reputation. In reality he despises the Cult of Shallya and its doctrine of helping those in need.</p>\n<h3>Deadly Secret: The Last of The Wittgensteins</h3>\n<p>Gotthard has two deadly secrets that the Characters may uncover: his real name is Gotthard von Wittgenstein, and he is a member of the Slaanesh-worshipping @JournalEntry[ONgaX7oeAjARcRgs]{Jade Sceptre Cult}.</p>\n<p>The Characters may recognise him from a painting in @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.1wRb1a5Tku2t0UvL]{Castle Wittgenstein} (see <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>), but it is no matter if they do not; there will be an incident that makes this clear.</p>\n<p>Like most Chaos cults, the Jade Sceptre operates in secret. It recruits among the city’s well-to-do pleasure-seekers, with scouts in most of the better hostelries and in the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}. Only the inner circle knows that the cult’s spiritual leader was the Graf ’s late wife, Baroness Anika-Elise Nikse. Since her untimely death, several senior members have plotted to replace her, including Gotthard. Meanwhile, the powerful Middenheim cell of the Purple Hand has seen an opportunity to weaken its rival.</p>\n<p>If confronted with proof of either of these secrets, Gotthard will bribe, beg, wheedle, offer unspeakable ‘favours,’ and do anything else that he thinks will get him off the hook — or at least, buy him time to arrange the Characters’ murder. The Characters might put him in their debt by rescuing him from various foes: rival Slaanesh cultists, Purple Hand agents, Witch Hunters, and even a group of Skaven in search of more Wittgenstein Warpstone. He has considerable resources and contacts in the city, but the Characters might think twice before forming an alliance with him: once he knows that someone knows his secrets, he will inevitably try to have them killed.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Arts}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Recitals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur Fights}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Horse Fair}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 2}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 3}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-Final 4}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Semi-Final 1}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Semi-Final 2}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Final}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 1)}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 2)}, </em>@JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/gotthard-wallenstein.webp","folder":"So1PdVn4b7FXXZLo","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"ieHrUyFz83TkBikg","name":"A Place To Stay","content":"<p>There are a number of high-class (and expensive!) inns in Middenheim, but the flood of Carnival visitors has left them all full.

However, the quality will be terrible — watered-down ale, rank food, and a common sleeping room, complete with flea-ridden straw, spit and worse! An <strong>Easy (+40) Endurance</strong> Test will be in order for each night the Characters spend steeping in such awful conditions, with a minor, single-symptom ailment such as Flux, Malaise, Nausea or Pox (GM’s choice) resulting from a failed roll.

{"_id":"j0YM1Bz8nObuMMVB","name":"Initial Inquiries: The Skaven","content":"<p>On the way to Middenheim, the Characters may have heard rumours about giant rats and rat-headed Beastmen in @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Middenheim’s Undercity}. After their encounters with Skaven in <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>, they are probably interested in finding out more. However, this will not be as easy as they might expect.</p>\n<p>To most people in the Old World, the Skaven are a myth. Although history records the Skaven Wars of 1,400 years ago, their activities since have been shrouded in secrecy. The Skaven take great care to destroy any evidence of their activities and kill any witnesses, lest their secret nests and tunnels beneath the Old World’s great cities should be discovered and a new series of wars ensue. Because of this, most in the Empire — especially in Middenheim, home of Count Mandred von Zelt, the legendary Ratslayer and greatest hero of the Skaven Wars — believe that the entire Skaven race was wiped out in the wars. Middenheimers  discount present-day sightings as the product of superstition and hysteria.</p>\n<p>Therefore, characters asking about Skaven are likely to encounter scorn and disbelief, and even to be fed ridiculous lines of nonsense by NPCs who want to amuse themselves at the expense of these credulous out-of-towners. Other NPCs may react angrily to such inquiries, their civic pride offended by any suggestion that the ratmen could have escaped detection and extermination.</p>\n<h3>Those Who Know</h3>\n<p>If the Characters ask the right questions in the right places, though, they may come across someone who knows that the Skaven still exist. Those who know  can tell them tales of hair-raising encounters. After the Characters hear enough such tales, a pattern starts to emerge — but by then, the events of the Carnival and the machinations of the Purple Hand require all their attention. Further investigation will have to wait until <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, in which the Characters will learn more about the dreaded ratmen than they ever wanted to know.</p>\n<h4>The Rat Catchers</h4>\n<p>If one wants to know about rats, of course, the best person to ask is a rat catcher. Middenheim’s rat catchers are licensed by the @JournalEntry[WI5fxShETkV7ungB]{Komission for Health, Education, and Welfare}, which is based in the @JournalEntry[ZWV1AbhVVbWfbEIz]{Neumarkt}-@JournalEntry[UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor} district. Anyone who goes there talking about Skaven is dismissed as a crackpot. A more cautious approach, for example, an enquiry about the @JournalEntry[I86oiOppQimWvWaP]{Rat Catchers' Guild} by a prospective member, leads the Characters to @JournalEntry[l8jWu9DzqX4QZ9ZZ]{the Regent's House} tavern off Schwanger Allee, where guild members meet in an upstairs room most evenings.</p>\n<p>The rat catchers are reluctant to speak of such matters to outsiders, but a few successful Fellowship Tests, helped along by a liberal quantity of ale, may establish trust enough to loosen a few tongues. The Characters may learn that rat-headed Beastmen are seen in the @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Undercity} now and again, although no one sober concedes that they are Skaven; they may also confirm the rumours of giant rats.</p>\n<h4>The Sewer Jacks</h4>\n<p>In the aftermath of the Skaven Wars Middenheim’s sewer jacks were established as a special arm of the City Watch  to patrol the Undercity and deal with any threats that might come up from below. Enquiries at any of the city gates lead the Characters to the Watch office on the @JournalEntry[asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials}. A Character with at least one warrior or rat catcher career can pose as a potential recruit, and be introduced to the leader of the sewer jacks, a tough-looking Halfling named Jacko Warble.</p>\n<p>Again, some <strong>Fellowship </strong>Tests are needed to establish a level of trust where the Characters can ask about Skaven without being laughed out of the building. But a sewer jack may confirm that Skaven — or creatures very like Skaven — have been encountered in the @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Undercity}, though the sewer jacks have been unable to discover how they get in and out, as they are fond of collapsing tunnels behind them to prevent pursuit.</p>\n<h4>The Dwarfs</h4>\n<p>The city’s Dwarven community knows the @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Undercity} better than almost any other group. Dwarf @JournalEntry[Ironbreakers] — specialists in underground warfare — often accompany sewer jack patrols. Enquiries at the @JournalEntry[kIJHDwY7mn8Bs8qR]{Komission for Elven, Dwarven, and Halfling} Interests may put the Characters in touch with local Dwarf leaders, and Dwarfs who ask at the @JournalEntry[A6D8GCA2S0g8vw8K]{Dwarven Engineers’ Guild}, the @JournalEntry[7wu8onhV4JEAuEfn]{Temple of Grungni}, or anywhere else associated with the Dwarven community will be directed to Modi Zargul at the Axe and Barrel Tavern in @JournalEntry[KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{the Wynd}. The place caters to a Dwarven clientele: its ceilings are 5’ 6”” high, counting as an enclosed space for Humans and Elves; all non-Dwarfs suffer a –10 penalty to <strong>Fellowship</strong> Tests; and there is a 75% chance that any Dwarf NPC encountered here has @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.0VpT5yubw4UL7j6f]{Animosity} toward Elves.</p>\n<p>Modi is one of several Ironbreakers in Middenheim, and admits to a fellow Dwarf that he sometimes leads unofficial patrols through the @JournalEntry[v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Undercity} on the orders of the Dwarf elders. He and his Ironbreakers have encountered Skaven, and are in no doubt that the creatures do exist: ‘but if the Manlings like to think otherwise, that’s their business. We just kill them when we find them.’</p>\n<h3>The Skaven Plot</h3>\n<p>The Skaven-worshipping Yellow Fang cult is well established in Middenheim. They have infiltrated organisations such as the @JournalEntry[0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, the @JournalEntry[I86oiOppQimWvWaP]{Rat Catchers' Guild}, the Sewer Jacks, and various Komissions. The Yellow Fang monitors the organisations it infiltrates for news of any threat to its masters in the Under-Empire. The cult generates a constant stream of misleading rumour to help obscure Skaven activities.</p>\n<p>The Skaven themselves are not unusually active in the city at present, with the exception of the group that kidnapped Reya, @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich’s} niece (see @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{Chaos Strikes By Night}) Success here helps the Characters free Ehrlich from Wasmeier’s control, and set the adventure’s finale in motion.</p>\n<p>However, the Skaven are not a major part of this adventure, and the players should realise quite quickly that there are other things afoot. If the players become obsessed with the Skaven, you may indulge them if you wish. However, be sure to have NPCs remind them that events involving the Carnival, the taxes, and growing sectarian discontent continue to build quite apart from what any large rats in the sewers may be plotting.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>IN THE SHADOW OF THE HORNED RAT</em></h3>\n<p><em>While the role of the Skaven is limited in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, the species of devious rat-creatures that plagues the Empire, often quite literally, will feature heavily in The Horned Rat, part four of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>. If you intend to run that adventure in the future then NPCs informed of Skaven activities, especially @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann}, may give the Characters' tales of humanoid rats some consideration. They will also make it clear, however, that any serious investigation will have to wait until after the Carnival has concluded.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img style=\"float:right;border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-sewers.webp\" width=\"584\" height=\"860\" /></p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/the-sewers.webp","folder":"Ve1StDqEHdnywAsd","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 4: Initial Inquiries","sort":500000}}}
{"_id":"jepWFu96Qh64OlHw","name":"The Traitor Unmasked","content":"<p>This chapter begins whenever the Characters trace @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} agent, @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich}, to her lair. There they find Reya, @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich’s} kidnapped niece. They return her safely to him, break Wasmeier’s control over him, and set the dramatic climax of the adventure into motion. Everything the Characters have failed to learn by now falls into place, and a desperate chase ensues as Wasmeier tries to make good his escape.</p>\n<h2>PAWNS OF THE EVIL WIZARD</h2>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This section has alternative features, depending on when the party finds the lair. You should be familiar with these before play. The pawns are not Purple Hand cultists, but expendable hirelings paid by the Law Lord to do his dirty work. They spend most of their time in a seedy den, playing cards and drinking. Unless they are prepared for some action, there is a 90% chance that one or more are asleep when the Characters arrive.</p>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} may use his pawns to spy on the Characters after their actions have brought them to his attention. If he decides to have them silenced, the GM must determine whether, when, and how the NPCs will strike. Klaglich is highly intelligent, and if any of the other pawns is caught, she immediately moves to a previously-prepared lair; keep the same map, but gives it a new location. If the Characters go to the authorities, enquiries are  made, but nothing comes of them — except perhaps that the authorities become more interested in the party.</p>\n<h2>The Pawns</h2>\n<p>@Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} (alias Elise kaltblutig, Charlotte &amp; Frau kenner), Ringleader</p>\n<p>@Actor[klwNbpAHe1oQ1oo6]{Dagmar Mitschuldige}, Mercenary</p>\n<p>@Actor[frMWa4mngN7z7n3g]{Hultz Fleischer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[eeJoYIenRt8CbtVU]{Anton Hundisch}</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A NOTE ON TRAPPINGS</em></h3>\n<p><em>The trappings listed for these NPCs are those which they will typically wear in their lair, if they are expecting trouble. If Brunhilde is wandering around in the city, for example, she will not be wearing armour, as it draws attention.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} is @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} trusted lieutenant. She is the only one who knows  their master’s identity. She will never reveal his identity: if she is captured, he will be her last hope of freedom. She will drink her Potion of Resistance, if it looks like she is about to be caught.</p>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} contacts her using coded instructions sent by carrier pigeon. Klaglich always burns a message after decoding it, but intercepted messages can be deciphered on a <strong>Hard (–20) Intelligence</strong> Test, a <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Mathematics) </strong>Test, or a succession of <strong>Challenging (+0) Research </strong>Tests totaling 10 SL. Klaglich has memorised the code, and does not have a cryptography book for the Characters to find. The code uses non-alphabetical symbols, so it is not possible to decipher the handwriting. If @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} has to contact the Law Lord in an emergency, she adopts a disguise and visits him at home, using her Stealth Skill to avoid being followed.</p>\n<p>@Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} has been very busy, and the party may have come across some or all of her activities. As ‘Charlotte,’ she hypnotised the @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Graf ’s Champion} into supporting the tax changes. As ‘Elise Kaltblutig,’ she stole the love-letters from @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} to the @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Graf ’s paramour}, and then used blackmail to gain his support for the taxes. Finally, as ‘Frau Kenner,’ she continues to supply @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald's Delight} to the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, to keep him loyal, so that the tax changes are maintained. This last role is very important, since she contacts the Chancellor on a regular basis, giving the party a chance to encounter her, and track her to the lair.</p>\n<h3>‘Frau Kenner’</h3>\n<p>@Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} visits the Inner Palace in this disguise once a week on Festag night to make a delivery to @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Sparsam}. He has given her a pass permitting entrance to the ground floor; it was with this pass that she was able to gain access via the gardens to the apartments of the Ladies-at-Court and steal the love-letters.</p>\n<p>Josef Gropius, a Palace man-at-arms, was attracted to Frau Kenner and, in a romantic move, followed her home one night some four weeks ago. He tracked her to the @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}. At this point he almost gave up, but out of curiosity he continued until he saw her enter an inn called ‘the Pit.’ He thought this strange, but concluded that the woman must be working undercover for someone important in the Palace. He then decided to leave her alone. Like all Palace staff, Josef is reliable. He  only reveals this information if asked by someone with authority, such as any of the major NPCs.</p>\n<p>It is very important to the pace of the adventure that the Characters are able to follow Frau Kenner after her visit to @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Sparsam} on Festag night. She will lead the party to the lair, and from this point on events lead to a thrilling climax. The party can achieve this in various ways, depending on how they have come to hear about ‘Frau Kenner.’ These are detailed in the following paragraphs.</p>\n<p>It is impossible for one person to trail someone through the huge crowds in the city on the last night of Carnival. The more Characters take part, the better the chance of success, and the street urchins could also be helpful. The crowds thin out as the @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} is reached, but even here the streets hold a sizeable number of drunken revellers.</p>\n<p>If the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} is the key, then all the Characters have to do is wait for her next delivery on the last night of the Carnival, at about 9.00pm. Sparsam is attending the opera that night, but will pop back to the Palace during the interval.</p>\n<p>If they have talked to Josef Gropius, the party will be aware of a place called ‘the Pit’ — or they may already have been there and bought information on ‘Frau Kenner’ from @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno Kohl}. They may simply stake the place out, in which case they will see ‘Frau Kenner’ arrive at about 8.30pm. She can then be trailed to the Inner Palace and, after supplying Sparsam, back to her lair. She will have a few drinks in various inns before she returns, arriving back at about 11.30pm.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are having difficulty tracing ‘Frau Kenner,’ one of the NPCs mentioned in @JournalEntry[mNMoXXZJKYGjXH7O]{‘The Harmacist’} may approach them with information about her base. A ‘gratitude payment’ of anything up to @Pay[2gc]{2 GCs} seems reasonable for such a service. Again, the pace of the adventure will benefit if this information is obtained on the last night of the Carnival.</p>\n<p>One final possibility is for the party to try and locate the lady in question by recruitment, perhaps hinting gently to dubious characters that they are looking for a woman with good disguise skills to pull off some confidence trick or other. The Characters might get into some rather unpleasant company in this way, but Brunhilde may hear of them and rise to the bait: although she works for @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, this does not stop her undertaking other commissions. She will be very wary, though and try to arrange a meeting somewhere where she is totally confident, and can escape if the need arises.</p>","folder":"NdV140BH3D9p6vpI","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 7: The Traitor Unmasked","sort":100000}}}
{"_id":"k22khmtcZMFViVqo","name":"Introduction (Power Behind the Throne)","content":"<p>Welcome to Power Behind the Throne, the third volume in the Director’s Cut edition of the Enemy Within campaign. While it can be played on its own, it has been designed to be played after completing @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.gnr5Hw8IJgA62V3R]{Death on the Reik}, volume 2 of the campaign. This book contains everything you need to play the adventure (except for the WFRP 4th edition rulebook), but the GM may find it useful to have a copy of @JournalEntry[tkm0lbhbghjMSXRA]{Middenheim: City of the White Wolf} as well: that book contains additional details on the city of Middenheim, including many useful locations and NPCs.</p>\n<h2>The Story</h2>\n<p>Following leads from their previous adventures, the Characters travel to the great fortress-city of @JournalEntry[Middenheim]. Along the way, they hear of trouble brewing in the city. On arrival they find that, behind the boisterous cheer of Middenheim’s famed @JournalEntry[YPpM7Pg44EgT2yt5]{Carnival}, sinister forces are at work. A raft of new taxes has alienated several groups that have always been crucial to the city’s defence; tensions between the Imperial cult of Sigmar and the local faith of Ulric regularly boil over into violence; and at least two Chaos cults are gnawing away at the city’s social and political fabric.</p>\n<p>The city’s ruler, the Elector Count @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris Todbringer}, does nothing, apparently in the midst of a deep depression following the death of his wife. The city’s movers and shakers, from the Graf ’s daughter to the city’s military commanders, are either blind to the danger or involved in the plot. Middenheim may fall to the enemy within — and if it does, the Empire’s great bastion against threats from the Northern Chaos Wastes becomes a stronghold for the Ruinous Powers.</p>\n<p>None of this is obvious at first glance. The Characters must piece everything together, identify the threats, and tread a political minefield in order to save the Graf, the city, and perhaps the whole of the Empire from a dangerous, cunning, and extremely well-connected foe.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>OPTIONS: GROGNARD BOXES</em></h3>\n<p><em>As in the other volumes in this series, new and alternative material is presented in ‘Grognard boxes’.

In this chapter the GM is given advice, resources, and ideas to help keep track of these major NPCs amidst the bustle of the Carnival, and to help deal with the Characters’ efforts to meet and impress them — and, most importantly, to find out what they know.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[jepWFu96Qh64OlHw]{The Traitor Unmasked}</h4>\n<p>As the Characters piece together what is going on, they eventually learn the whereabouts of the villain’s main agent. Raiding this safe house, they rescue a hostage who proves to be the vital piece in the puzzle. Freeing the hostage frees a major NPC from the villain’s control, and the plot begins to unravel.</p>\n<p>The climax of the adventure is a race against time to prevent the traitor from escaping, and doing serious damage to the city in the process.</p>\n<h2>RUNNING THE ADVENTURE</h2>\n<p>The plot of this adventure is extremely complex, and involves a large number of important NPCs.

{"_id":"kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH","name":"Carnival Events: Square of Martials","content":"<p>@JournalEntry[asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials}</p>\n<h4>Challenges to the Graf ’s Champion (Wellentag-Backertag, 11 a.m.– 1:00 p.m.)</h4>\n<p>Two combats (at 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.) take place between @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}, the Graf ’s Champion, and any challengers for his title. In theory, anyone may issue a challenge (including any Character), but members of the City Guard weed out the time-wasters (anyone with Strength or Weapon Skill below 30). Two challengers are chosen by lot each day.</p>\n<p>All challengers must pay an entrance fee of @Pay[3gc]{3 GCs} before the combat, and sign a document swearing never to take up arms against the Todbringer family, their servants and subjects, and undertaking, if successful, to serve the Graf as champion until defeated in combat.</p>\n<p>Dieter has been undefeated for four years, so there are few challengers. If a qualified Character issues a challenge, you may roll dice to represent the drawing of lots, but the Character’s lot is automatically drawn if you think it desirable. </p>\n<p>Anyone who tries to even the odds — for example by bribing Dieter — faces disappointment and considerable trouble. Dieter refuses to be bribed, and is mortally offended by the mere suggestion.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE RULES OF COMBAT</em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>No Magic</strong>. Both combatants are inspected by a wizard before the combat begins. His ornate, silver-banded black wand glows blue if either party is under the effects of any spell, enchantment, or magic item. If this happens, the offender is expelled from the event, and pelted with fruit by an enthusiastic crowd.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Armour</strong>. Both contestants wear a sleeved mail coat, a mail coif, and a helmet. If both parties agree on a one-handed weapon (see below), then both may use a shield as well.<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Weapons</strong>. Any hand-to-hand weapon may be used, but both combatants must use the same type of weapon: swords or quarter-staves are normal. If both parties cannot agree on the choice of weapons, a senior member of the City Guardadjudicates — usually in favour of the existing Champion. <br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Subdual</strong>. Combat is not to the death: the fighters must @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.Ssod4QuBdyMS6F79]{Pull their Blows}, which means that their attacks cannot cause Critical Wounds. A combatant is defeated when their Wounds  are reduced to zero — the adjudicators are very experienced in judging when a fighter has reached this point.  If any blow is clearly struck in anger or with intent to maim or kill, a half-dozen Watchmen separate the contestants and drag the offender off to the cells.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Defeat</h4>\n<p>Dieter never loses to a NPC challenger. An unsuccessful challenger is prohibited from challenging again for another two years, but the crowd may still cheer for a valiant loser.</p>\n<h4>Victory</h4>\n<p>A defeat does not bother Dieter unduly, since he wants to get married, and has been thinking about stepping down from his post anyway. If the Character is a gracious victor, for example, congratulating Dieter on a fight well fought and complimenting him on his past record, Dieter may invite them out for a celebratory drink. At your option, he may be accompanied by @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}, @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}, and @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}, giving the Characters a chance to make their acquaintance.</p>\n<p>The winner receives a splendid silver medallion (1 GC) and cup (30 GCs). The medallion is awarded for life, but the cup must be passed on to whomever next becomes the Graf ’s champion.</p>\n<p>The new champion’s name is inscribed on a massive copy of the cup, which is displayed in the square during the contest, and kept in the Treasury at other times. In addition, an appreciative crowd may throw small change to the value of [[/r 1d10]] silver shillings, if they enjoyed the fight.</p>\n<p>If Dieter loses one of the early bouts, his successor must face any subsequent challenges. These challengers are of similar ability to the Character (perhaps a point of two lower here and there, if you are  feeling kind). Obviously, it makes sense to challenge Dieter close to the end of the event!</p>\n<p>The winner of the eighth and final combat is inducted as the Graf ’s champion, and must take a lengthy oath (backed up by a long and complex legal document) undertaking to serve the Graf faithfully and well as his champion. The character may elect to enter the career of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.RNcsFphKVYohTrS9]{Duelist} for free, though this is not compulsory. A speech is customary at this point: let the player improvise one, and judge how favourably it impresses the crowd, and any major NPCs who are present. The following are likely to be crowd pleasers: mentioning the greatness of Middenheim, the might of Ulric, or the excellent quality of the Carnival .</p>\n<p>After the ceremony, the new champion is summoned (alone) to a brief audience with the three @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Midden Marshals}. At your option, any Character who catches their eye may be summoned before them. After an initial round of pleasantries, @Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{von Genscher} inquires about the Character’s hometown and background. All three Marshals stress the duties and responsibilities of the Graf ’s champion, the social and political aspects of the position, and so on. If the Characters have already been active among the major NPCs, von Genscher tactfully inquires about their goals and intentions.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the Character have the opportunity to question the Marshals subtly — though they will not appreciate being grilled. If the character impresses the Marshals — and especially if the event @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{‘Chaos Strikes by Night’} has already been concluded successfully — the Marshals will be more open, expressing concern about the political situation while emphasising their determination to remain above politics for the sake of their military duty.</p>\n<h4>Audience with the Graf</h4>\n<p>After the investiture, the new champion is summoned to the palace for a brief audience with the Graf himself. Like the Marshals, the Graf stresses the duties of the post, saying nothing that the Character has not heard before. At this formal interview, the new champion is not given the opportunity to do anything except nod, bow, and express thanks for the honour of the post.</p>\n<p>This is an opportunity for the Character to see the Graf, and realise how much he is struggling under the crushing weight of his despair. He rambles, trails off, and repeats himself several times during his speech, and one or more of the NPCs present tries to keep him on track. However, if the new Champion is truly respectful of the Graf, and shows commitment to the role, do allow the Graf a moment of clarity to nod slowly and praise them for their victory over Deiter. </p>\n<p>For further advice on portraying Graf Boris Todbringer, see @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Boris Todbringer}.</p>\n<p>There is much to gain in terms of networking with important NPCs as the audience might include the @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess,’} one of more Marshals, the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, and perhaps a Law Lord: many of the city’s great and good are curious about the new champion.</p>\n<p>This event is attended by the following NPCs</p>\n<p><strong>Wellentag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} (participating)</p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulric Schutzmann}</p>\n<p>@Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Johann Schwermutt}</p>\n<p>@Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen}</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<p>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris}</p>\n<p><strong>Aubentag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} (participating)</p>\n<p>@Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Maximillian von Genscher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<p><strong>Marktag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} (participating)</p>\n<p>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}</p>\n<p>@Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}</p>\n<p>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert}</p>\n<p><strong>Backertag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} (participating)</p>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulric Schutzmann}</p>\n<p>@Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Johann Schwermutt}</p>\n<p>@Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Maximillian von Genscher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}</p>\n<p>@Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich}</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<p>@Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/bow.webp\" width=\"563\" height=\"83\" /></div>\n<h4>The Archery Tournament (Wellentag-Marktag, 2–4:00 p.m.)</h4>\n<p>There is no entrance fee, but those who wish to enter must look reasonably presentable.

Most warrior types give at the lower end of the scale; nobles and other wealthy types give more.</p>\n<p>The Tournament is a friendly affair, with a lot of back-slapping and amusement; it is not a serious pursuit of excellence, although @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel} is eager to retain his title. Each archer fires with a bow or shortbow — no longbows, elf bows, or crossbows allowed, and, of course, not so much as a whiff of gunpowder. Shooters stand 30 yd away from a circular target. The target consists of five coloured rings of increasing size: the white bullseye; red; yellow; blue; and green. Each archer fires three arrows, and the score is totalled. Each day’s winner receives a small silver medallion (6/-) on a blue ribbon. At the end of the Carnival, the overall winner (best total score over all three days) is awarded the golden Champion’s medallion (3 GCs) on a red ribbon, which may be kept.</p>\n<p>The target is of average size, and Characters may aim, if they remember to do so.

In the first place, trying to smoke out the cave’s occupants, as in the original, will have no effect on undead Kurt.

Entrance</h3>\n<p>When Gräber is out, two candles provide faint illumination in the passage leading into the cave. If the Characters make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test, they find recent footprints near the entrance.</p>\n<h3>B. Bend</h3>\n<p>The passage turns at this point. A skull rests on a ledge along the southern wall. A candle sits on the skull, which is covered with melted wax.</p>\n<p>This is a normal skull but has the spell @Item[q1ZeCUT0gYk6KF7r]{Snitch} cast on it. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test reveals that the footprints stay clear of the skull. The spell will activate if a creature comes within 2 yards, informing @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} that intruders are present.</p>\n<p>The passage opens up beyond the skull to reveal a large, candle-lit cave to the right and a cloth screen ahead. Unless forewarned, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} has a torch burning in area E, and its light shines under the curtain. Depending on the time of day and how cautious they have been, the party may hear Gräber muttering to himself — usually rehearsing some grandiose speech for the benefit of a future victim — or lightly snoring.</p>\n<h3>C. Store</h3>\n<p>This area is filled with enough food and water to last one person about two weeks, as well as a stack of pre-made torches, a few dozen candles, and whatever miscellaneous supplies the GM cares to add. A Small individual could hide behind the stores, until someone took something from the piles.</p>\n<h3>D. Bone Cave</h3>\n<p>The floor of the cave is littered with bones, except for an open area in the centre where skulls of various types — some animal, some warped, and some Human-looking — are laid out in a circle. @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} started with 40 of the things, and any not captured or destroyed by the Characters or currently being used by the Necromancer are found here in a dormant state.</p>\n<h3>E. Gräber’s Camp</h3>\n<p>Gräber’s living quarters are behind a sack-cloth curtain. Unless previously encountered, @Actor[YTjyvukWNRORQcg6]{Kurt} stands at the back. A torch, its butt-end stuck in a small bucket of dirt, provides light if Gräber is there. A bedroll is the only furniture.</p>\n<h4>The Final Battle</h4>\n<p>If the GM has not decided to keep the Characters in a continued state of frustration by having @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} flee before being cornered or ambushed, the climactic battle takes place here.</p>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} tactics vary according to his evaluation of his opponents. If the party seems to be small, weak, or seriously wounded, he may decide to fight to the death. He is more likely, however, to try to create an opportunity to escape.</p>\n<p>While working to perfect his control of the skulls, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} did not neglect the rest of the bones. Each morning, he casts @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.7BJDTRG65hwt1fUK]{Reanimate} on them, and at his command a number of headless @Actor[zDmykIAVWRBfTIJx]{Skeletons} haul themselves upright and move to attack the Characters. The exact number is up to the GM. According to the rules the spell raises a number of @Actor[zDmykIAVWRBfTIJx]{Skeletons} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies} equal to the caster’s Willpower Bonus + SL. The GM can roll the necessary dice in front of the Players if desired, or pre-roll before running the adventure and make a note of how many will rise, or simply pick a number. If the combat seems to be going a bit too easily, a few more headless Skeletons might pull themselves together enough to join the battle.</p>\n<p>At @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} command, the @Actor[zDmykIAVWRBfTIJx]{Skeletons} (and @Actor[05HjHIxiQgPWIpOf]{Kurt} the Zombie too, if he is present) move to grapple the Characters. Gräber plans to have them hold the intruders and push them back, creating a clear passage for him to run out of the cave and thwarting any attempts at pursuit. If all the Characters are grappled, he feels confident enough to treat each one with a spell like @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.HqInHmOviuLqymdm]{Screaming Skull} from the Lore of Necromancy, or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.vEuljwoWR2rOTU5y]{Caress of Laniph}, or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.ifjDVtgGEh787p20]{Steal Life} from the Lore of Death, delivering a suitably bombastic speech as he does so.

The Doktor runs by them, laughing and clutching his trousers and boots in one hand as an outraged spouse pursues him, dressed in a nightshirt, nightcap, and carpet slippers and brandishing a blunderbuss. Perhaps the Doktor stumbles or stubs a bare toe, leaving him momentarily at the mercy of his pursuer; if the Characters can step in, knock the barrel of the gun upward before it fires, or do anything else to help him, Pavarotti insists on treating them to an epic drinking session which lasts at least until dawn and probably until noon. Thereafter, if the Characters have proven to be good companions, Pavarotti becomes their fast friend — which can be useful but also exhausting, as he insists on going drinking with them all night, every night.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Pavarotti does not know many of the other major NPCs well, and regards even fewer of them as friends. However, he can be useful in getting the Characters into all manner of drinking establishments, identifying the Pit as a good place to buy illicit substances — and, of course, freeing @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} from his post-hypnotic suggestion.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A RED HERRING</em></h3>\n<p><em>If you  wish, and if they are feeling supremely confident, it may be beneficial to introduce at least some of the Law Lords before the final act of the adventure. After all, if the Players feel that you have been steering them away from the Law Lords — they may well begin to smell a rat. It might also be more satisfying if the Characters, upon finally unmasking the culprit, feel that clues as to their identity were laid down earlier in the narrative. The principal risk is that a Character figures out early on who the culprit is. If you decide to be daring and allow them to meet Wasmeier, you should be careful in how you present him. If he comes off as obviously evil, then players unconsciously begin to suspect him. Conversely, if you overcompensate by making him too friendly or helpful, this appears just as suspicious. </em></p>\n<p><em>The best presentation for @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} is the one which he already shows to the people of Middenheim — that of a somewhat aloof but dedicated and fair arbitrator of the law, and a neutral advisor to the Graf. Consider having him deflect any concerns about his role in the new taxes by muttering that, while the Law Lords present a single opinion to the Graf, he certainly didn’t vote for it. If the Characters pester him for assistance, have him direct them to gather some arbitrary number of signatures from the populace, which he promises to present to the Graf on their behalf. It will make for decent kindling, if nothing else. Wasmeier is happy to have inquisitive Characters tied up in such busy work, though undoubtedly he will also keep a close eye on anyone that seems too dedicated to their inquiries, and will send some muscle to deal with anyone who he deems to be a risk.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/luigi-pavarotti.webp","folder":"IOqzzXGRK0YmZ3sY","sort":1500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":1500000}}}

{"_id":"m2iCtJ3eBsUwP0Dd","name":"You Are Feeling Sleepy...","content":"<p>This section covers what might happen if the Characters discover that @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} has been hypnotised into supporting the tax changes, and attempt to undo the hypnosis. If they can do this, and if Dieter is still the Graf ’s Champion, they have turned one of @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} unwitting pawns into a useful ally of their own.</p>\n<p>Discovery</p>\n<p>The Characters may notice something strange about @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter’s} attitude to the tax changes simply by talking to him. His NPC Sheet includes several set phrases that he is compelled to repeat in response to questions about the taxes. When talking about related matters — say, Dwarfs in general — Dieter is under no such compulsion, and may contradict himself. If questioned about this, Dieter does not see that his statements are incompatible.</p>\n<p>This encounter should be played very carefully: on the one hand, Dieter’s mind has been tampered with; but on the other, the effects are not readily apparent. If the Players are having trouble, the Characters might make a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test to notice a subtle change in Dieter’s behaviour when talking about the taxes: a glazed look in the eyes; a slight lack of emotion in his voice; and so on. A character with the @Item[vXJq3j6MGR3oThG0]{Hypnotism} Skill recognises the condition straight away, and knows what to do about it (see ‘De-hypnotising Dieter,’ below).</p>\n<p>A final hint for struggling Players — and this might happen anyway — occurs if Dieter gets very drunk. Just before unconsciousness, the effects of the alcohol will temporarily negate the effects of the hypnotism, and Dieter can converse about the taxes as he thinks fit — if somewhat slurred. When he sobers up, however, the hypnosis will be operative again.</p>\n<h3>What To Do?</h3>\n<p>Assuming the party has realised that Dieter is under some sort of charm or mental control, they probably want to do something about it.</p>\n<p>Questioning Dieter when he is drunk produces little information: in this state Dieter can barely talk, and is a long way from remembering who hypnotised him. Characters may make an <strong>Average (+20) Hypnotism</strong> or <strong>Difficult (–10) Heal</strong> Test to realise that the symptoms point to hypnosis, which can only be lifted by someone with Hypnotism Skill. If none of the Characters has this Skill, there are a few other options:</p>\n<h4>Carnival Entertainers</h4>\n<p>It may be difficult to find a genuine hypnotist at the Carnival, as opposed to a charlatan with a good sales pitch. However, if the Characters are prepared to ask around, they can find someone suitable. Treat this individual as a standard entertainer or charlatan with Hypnotism Skill. Dr Woldo or Walda Zeggesmund seems an appropriate sort of name. The initial cost for a de-hypnosis will be @Pay[1gc]{1 GC}, rising to @Pay[3gc]{3 GCs} if Dr Zeggesmund learns whom he or she is to hypnotise, and @Pay[6gc]{6 GCs} if @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} is unwilling.</p>\n<p>This will be the least favourite option of any other major NPCs, if the Characters have made their acquaintance. All of them will worry about entrusting a wandering entertainer with such a delicate matter, with the potential to cause a scandal and to threaten the city’s security. One miscreant has already compromised the Graf ’s Champion: who is to say whether another hypnotist — especially one who will be gone at the end of the week, if not before — might not place an even more dangerous suggestion in his mind?</p>\n<h4>The Physicians’ Guild</h4>\n<p>@JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Middenheim’s Physicians’ Guild} is rather fussy about whom it accepts. In the eyes of the Physicians’ Guild Council hypnotism smacks of charlatanry. However, if the Characters fail to find a hypnotist anywhere else, and if they are careful about how they approach the Guild, they may be successful here. The initial price quoted will be @Pay[3gc]{3GCs}, @Pay[6gc]{doubling} once the physician learns the patient’s identity.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{The Temple of Shallya}</h4>\n<p>If handled correctly (perhaps with a story about a friend with a mental ailment that seems to have been induced by hypnosis), enquiries here provide the party with the services of Maria Ferberg, who — although still a novice — has decent powers of hypnosis (Hypnotism 55). While no charge is made for her services, a donation to the temple is expected.</p>\n<h4>The Good Doctor</h4>\n<p>The Characters might hear a rumour (at the @JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Physicians’ Guild}, for example) that @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan’s} improvement is due to a powerful hypnotic influence exerted by @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}. This could place them in a dilemma.</p>\n<p>Firstly, having heard various unsavoury things about Pavarotti, they might conclude that the Tilean is behind @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter’s} condition. They might even conclude that he is behind the whole plot, and take some rash action against him. This would alienate a powerful potential ally, but on its own this one setback should not make the adventure impossible to complete successfully.</p>\n<p>If they resist this red herring; the Characters might try to arrange a meeting with Pavarotti, and try to persuade him to treat Dieter in addition to sounding him out for other information. If Pavarotti sees that Dieter has been hypnotised, he begins to take an active interest in the situation, and may be of considerable help.</p>\n<h4>Other Major NPCs</h4>\n<p>In addition to these possibilities, the Characters may wish to discuss the problem with one or more of Dieter’s friends, such as @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane}, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel}, or Dieter’s fiancée, @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}. These NPCs tend to go along with whatever the Characters suggest, provided Dieter is not put at risk.</p>\n<p>None of the three allow Dieter anywhere near a hypnotist from the Carnival. Only Kirsten knows that the @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Baronial Physician} is reputed to have hypnotic powers, but she finds the Tilean a little disturbing, and may need persuading to let him treat Dieter.</p>\n<h3>De-Hypnotising Dieter</h3>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} will not care for the idea of being hypnotised again, even to undo the previous hypnotism: he dislikes the idea of having someone ‘walking about in his mind,’ as he puts it. However, if @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten} both persuade him, he agrees reluctantly.</p>\n<p>Failing persuasion, the Characters might contrive to get Dieter mildly drunk, so that he is unaware of the initial hypnotic contact. However, this raises problems of professional ethics for anyone from the @JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Physicians’ Guild}, and also for Maria Ferberg from the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{temple of Shallya}: neither one will hypnotise someone without their knowledge, unless instructed by their superiors. A Carnival hypnotist will have no such qualms — at least, none that cannot be soothed by a little more gold — while Pavarotti is quite happy to act on his own initiative. For the sake of the following, he is assumed to be the hypnotist: you should make any necessary changes if another character is performing the procedure.</p>\n<p>A quiet, darkened room is necessary. This may be easily arranged: @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} will be happy to have his back room used, for example. @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi} sits Dieter in a comfortable chair, and tells him to fix his eyes on a silver medallion which Luigi will swing before his eyes on a chain. Luigi’s voice drops to a quiet monotone, very different from his usual demeanour.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Look at the disc, the disc, and listen to my voice. Listen to my voice. All you attend to is the disc — watch it swing, you cannot look away from it — and also my voice. As you watch the disc, your eyes are feeling tired, your eyelids are closing, and you are feeling sleepy. You are relaxing, listening to my voice, and feeling sleepy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This continues for a few minutes. After this time, Dieter is hypnotised, and will react only to what Luigi tells him.</p>\n<p>Luigi asks what the Characters want to do. He could remove the effects of Dieter’s previous hypnosis right away, or he could first ask the Champion some questions. Hypnotically induced amnesia can only be overcome in a trance, so this is a good time to ask questions.</p>\n<p>The original hypnosis is already wearing off, so any attempt at negating it succeeds. Some possible questions are detailed below, but it is necessary to improvise answers to other enquiries. The information in italics may be useful.</p>\n<p><strong>When?</strong> ‘Nearly two months ago.”’<strong>Where? </strong>‘The Showboat’ (@JournalEntry[IEjGO7UD5QfWsrV2]{A restaurant} and cabaret in @JournalEntry[UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{the Great Park}.)</p>\n<p>After a night on the town, Dieter had ended up at this upper-class establishment, mildly drunk. Sitting alone in a quiet corner, he was approached by a young woman. @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten} does not like this answer if she is present.</p>\n<p><strong>What was her name?</strong> ‘Charlotte.’ <strong>What did she look like?</strong> ‘Attractive.’ @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten} likes this answer even less.</p>\n<p><strong>Describe her</strong>: ‘Red hair, green eyes, mid-20s, medium height and build. She spoke with a Bretonnian accent.’</p>\n<p>What did she tell him to do? At this, Dieter repeats in sequence all the phrases detailed on his NPC Sheet.</p>\n<p><em>No one knows yet that this was @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} in disguise.</em></p>\n<p>After asking all these questions, or when Dieter fails to answer, Luigi suggests negating the previous hypnosis, and implants strong suggestions in Dieter’s mind against being hypnotised by the same person again. Kirsten agrees to this if she is present.</p>\n<h3>After The Hypnosis</h3>\n<p>Dieter does not remember anything about this session, but he has a vague recollection of being hypnotised before.</p>\n<p>If Maria is the hypnotist, she returns to the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple} and says no more about the incident. Dr Zeggesmund(or any entertainer) probably stays silent on the matter: getting involved in high-society affairs is a dangerous business. Still, he or she may ask for a little extra gold.</p>\n<p>Luigi is intrigued by all he has learned. He is not pleased that someone has exerted hypnotic control over this decent man, although he has a grudging admiration for the original hypnotist’s Skill. He will realise, of course, that skulduggery is afoot, and this makes him more positively disposed toward the Characters.</p>\n<h3>What Can Be Learned</h3>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter’s} eventual response is important. Realising that he has been hypnotised into supporting the new taxes makes him angry. However, he is now on the side of the Characters, as they try to win as many sources of influence as possible. If he has already been defeated as Champion, however, he no longer has any influence to use to help them, but he certainly helps in any other way he can. Any NPC friend of Dieter who learns of the hypnotism is  also well disposed toward the Characters, and provides any further help they can.</p>\n<p>Following up the reference to @JournalEntry[IEjGO7UD5QfWsrV2]{The Showboat} will prove fruitless. Dieter visits fairly often, so his presence was nothing new. In addition, ‘Charlotte’ was very careful not to draw undue attention to herself, approaching Dieter as he sat in one of the secluded booths designed to foil prying eyes. The only other clue worth having is the fact that @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} did not hypnotise Dieter. If the party were suspicious of him before, this fact points towards his innocence.</p>","folder":"IOqzzXGRK0YmZ3sY","sort":1662500,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":1662500}}}

A Character can be sure that this is indeed @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald’s Delight} by trying some of the Chancellor’s supply, and then trying some of what Bruno offers; a successful <strong>Hard (–20) Trade (Apothecary or Poisoner)</strong> or <strong>Lore (Chemistry or Medicine)</strong> Test will allow the Characters to tell whether they are the same. </p>\n<p>A character with <em>Lore (Chemistry) </em>and/or <em>Trade (Apothecary)</em> can also identify the substance as Ranald’s Delight, but this requires equipment: there is no question of setting it up in the bar, although renting a room upstairs for @Pay[4ss]{4 Schillings} for an hour would be fine with Werner, and @Actor[qF6Ey2YH0PZhi1eX]{Bruno} will not object.</p>\n<p>If the question of a regular supply is raised, Bruno replies that he is always here, and can sell them up to 20 more doses, if they wait while he gets it. He leaves and returns with with a packed Middenball bag in 30–60 minutes, asking 1 GC per dose as before, which can be reduced by haggling.</p>\n<p>The Characters may ask who buys @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald’s Delight} on a regular basis. If they give Bruno the description of @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} that they got from @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor Sparsam}, he winks knowingly but says that she is a good customer and he cannot afford to lose her. In fact, Bruno will guess that the woman is likely to fall foul of the party and stop buying from him soon: with this in mind, he aims to get some money out of the party first — 50 GCs if possible. He won’t sell her out for less than 10 GCs no matter how well the characters bribe or haggle.  For this, Bruno reveals that she visits once a week, and he expects her again on Festag night.</p>\n<h3>More Incidents</h3>\n<p>The Pit can be used as the setting for a number of small incidents, ranging from a bar-room brawl to a raid from an Elite Guard squad looking for a kidnapped VIP.

In any event, the Watch does not patrol this area of the city.</p>\n<p>The four live in the basement of the ruined house. There is no plan of the house itself, since no action takes place there. The rooms contain only dust, damp, rotten wood and debris, and possibly the odd spider or mouse. The windows are boarded up, but the back one has a 6-inch hole cut into the wood for the carrier pigeons. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test will reveal feathers caught in the wood, plus grain and droppings on the floor. </p>\n<p>The front and back doors are both locked (count as a Latch for the purposes of <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests). The back door has been rigged with a deadfall trap which drops a lump of masonry on anyone opening it (S 4, roll [[/r D10]] for hit location: 1–3 left arm; 4–6 right arm; 7–10 head).</p>\n<p>There is a trapdoor (3ft square) in the ground floor back room which is barred on the underside. The signal to open the trapdoor is two stamps, pause five seconds, two stamps. Only the four pawns know the code, so if they are all in the lair they will naturally be suspicious of anyone outside using it. Beneath the trapdoor, a set of narrow wooden steps leads down about 15  ft. Living rooms and corridors in the underground lair have a ceiling height of 9ft, and are lit with oil-burning lamps. </p>\n<h3>Basement Landing</h3>\n<p>Bare, undecorated, and only dimly lit.</p>\n<h3>Dagmar’s Chamber</h3>\n<p>@Actor[klwNbpAHe1oQ1oo6]{Dagmar} the mercenary will be here, idling away her time whittling wood or playing a game of Lonely Emperor with a pack of scuffed cards, and whistling a few off-key bars of ‘To Hunt the Manticore’. The room contains a pallet bed, a wardrobe with spare clothes (nothing unusual), a small table and two chairs, and other mundane living, drinking and eating utensils.</p>\n<h3>Hultz’s Chamber</h3>\n<p>The general decor is very similar to Dagmar’s chamber, although there are a couple of better (but hardly good) carpets on the floor and a thick fur bed-cover.</p>\n<h3>Food Store</h3>\n<p>Contains ale, wine, fruits, sweetmeats, pickles cheese, tubers, dried meat, salted fish and so on. If nothing else, the pawns eat well during their stay here.</p>\n<h3>Latrine</h3>\n<p>A vertical shaft to the sewer not far below.</p>\n<h3>Stores</h3>\n<p>Oils, spare lamps, ropes, candles, a bale of twine, lengths of wood, coils of wire, various tools, etc. Reya Ehrlich sits tied to a chair, bound and gagged. @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} has orders to ensure that @Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Ehrlich’s} niece remains safe and well — she is a prized asset, after all. Klaglich insists that no one speaks to her while she is kept hostage, in case they give anything away. This has put her at odds with Dagmar, who has become attached to Reya, and has been updating her on the Carnival’s events — no one likes to miss a good show. Klaglich has told the others that Reya is being held for a ransom, which is to be paid soon.</p>\n<h3>Brunhilde’s Chamber</h3>\n<p>This room is furnished with a pallet bed, large wardrobe containing clothes for Klaglich’s many aliases, table and chair, and two tatty fur rugs. Some minor items (plates, cutlery, and the like) litter the place. A dresser is piled with tubs of rouge, panstick, kohl, wigs and other makeup needed to facilitate her disguises. In one corner is a small aviary containing [[/r d10]] carrier pigeons trained to go to @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}. Careful searching reveals a small pile of ashes where past messages have been burnt. </p>\n<p>The smell of avian excrement mixed with burnt damp paper is malodorous. </p>\n<p>There is a small secret compartment underneath the bed containing one bag with @Credit[45gc SPLIT]{45 Gold Crowns}, a bag with two fancy necklace and ear-ring sets of chrysoberyl and lapis lazuli in intricate silver settings (each set 20 GCs), and a solid gold ingot worth 35 GCs. The jewellery is stolen, so if the Characters sell it in the city they could get into trouble. </p>\n<p>Also in this hidey-hole are the love-letters from High Priest @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} to the Graf ’s paramour, @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}. They are addressed to ‘Em’ and signed by ‘Big Bad Wolf.’ Academics will note that the parchment and ink are of very high quality. The contents are sentimental protestations of undying affection, poems, and so on. Finally, the code-book for @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} messages is here.</p>\n<p>Bath Chamber </p>\n<p>A wooden tub, with a pump nearby for drawing water. Soap, thread-bare towels, and a small, dirty mirror are on a table, but do not appear to have been used much.</p>\n<p>Anton’s Chamber</p>\n<p>Decor is generally the same as for any other bedroom/chambers. Contents include various books (no spell books), worth about 20 GCs in total, and small quantities of material components for his Petty Magic Spells.</p>","folder":"NdV140BH3D9p6vpI","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 7: The Traitor Unmasked","sort":400000}}}
{"_id":"nPuUsRMfAFe2l6Ll","name":"Upstairs, Downstairs","content":"<p>If he sees that he is being followed, @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} races up the stairs in the hall, making sure the Characters see him. If they pursue him up the stairs, he kicks over a decorative wine barrel standing on the landing and sends it crashing down towards his pursuers. Anyone standing on the stairs, or at the foot (presumably to aim a bow or crossbow), must pass an <strong>Agility</strong> Test or suffer a Damage 3 hit and gain a @Condition[Prone] Condition. The test is <strong>Difficult (–10) </strong>for those on the stairs, and <strong>Challenging (+0) </strong>for those at the foot. At the GM’s option, those on the stairs may take additional falling Damage according to where they were when struck.</p>\n<p>As the Characters are distracted by the barrel, @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} rushes back down the stairs, leaping the banister half way down (a 3-yard jump). Assuming he lands safely, he races back to the cellar and enters the sewers through the secret passage. If anyone is still able to pursue him, he turns and fires his crossbow, or simply keeps running if his pursuers are too close. If capture seems inevitable, he swallows his poison capsule as described above.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/crossbow-pistol.webp\" width=\"271\" height=\"205\" /></div>\n<h3>The House</h3>\n<p>Only brief descriptions of the rooms are given, as it is unlikely the Characters will spend much time here. Should the party choose to loot the place, it might be prudent to have a Watch patrol come to investigate — this is a well-off district, and there is, in all likelihood, a body still in the street outside. All the rooms can be illuminated by lanterns hanging from the ceiling rafters, but at present, only those ones in rooms 1, 7, 11, and 12 are lit.</p>\n<h4>1. Hallway</h4>\n<p>The hallway is opulently furnished, with hunting trophies and tapestries on the walls. A plush blue carpet covers the floor. An elaborate staircase in the south-western corner spirals upwards to a balcony that overlooks the hall. There are three tapestries here, each worth 12 GCs. The hunting trophies are not especially valuable.</p>\n<h4>2. Dining Room</h4>\n<p>This room is currently a mess. Two bodies are sprawled across the floor. The table is upturned and shattered glass lies everywhere. What must once have been an expensive wooden cabinet has been smashed in at the front; its drawers and their contents have been scattered across the room. The two bodies are those of the servants who tried to oppose @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} as he pursued Ernest. The ensuing fight succeeded in completely devastating the whole room, leaving nothing of value unbroken.</p>\n<h4>3. Lounge</h4>\n<p>This is where Klauss used to entertain his guests while they relaxed after a meal. The room has not suffered the same fate as the dining room. Several luxurious armchairs, a large decorative fireplace, and an elaborate sideboard provide grand furnishing. Four paintings hang on the walls, each worth 7 GCs, but again, looting should be discouraged.</p>\n<h4>4. Kitchen</h4>\n<p>This large room has a flight of stone stairs leading down into the cellar. Two clubs rest in a puddle of blood, evident to anyone entering the room. A successful search turns up an ornamental clasp decorated with the symbol of the Horned Rat: three crossed bones forming the shape of an inverted triangle. All three items were dropped during the scuffle between Klauss, Ernest, and the cultists, and the clasp may reveal just what the Characters are up against. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Theology or Middenheim) </strong>Test reveals the nature of the symbol and its connection to the Skaven. Even so, many Characters may believe that the Skaven are no more than a fairytale.</p>\n<h4>5. Corridor</h4>\n<p>A corridor connects the hall to the kitchen. As it is a part of the house that guests would not normally see, it is merely stone-flagged, showing none of the splendour seen elsewhere.</p>\n<h4>6. Storeroom</h4>\n<p>This is where all the food and other domestic requirements of the house are kept, under lock and key. However, when Klauss and Ernest went to investigate the sounds of the cultists breaking in, they armed themselves with clubs kept here (now to be found in the kitchen), and Klauss forgot to lock the door in his hurry. Thus, the door is slightly ajar, the keys still in the lock.</p>\n<p>Inside are several sacks of grain, stacked neatly against one wall along with many other common food items.</p>\n<p>A wooden crate marked <em>‘DANGER! EXPLOSIVES’</em> sits innocently in the corner, and contains four @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.X8WFQf0HB9yXKjdD]{Bombs}. In addition, there are two lanterns here, three spare flasks of oil, and a tinderbox. The Bombs could prove very useful to the party in the later part of the adventure, should they choose to take them.</p>\n<h4>7. Balcony</h4>\n<p>The stairs from the hallway spiral upwards to this balcony, which overlooks the hall below. The floor here is also covered in blue carpet, but there are no adornments, save for a large, decorative wine barrel on the landing.</p>\n<h4>8. Guest Chamber</h4>\n<p>Visitors to the house are normally accommodated here. A large four-poster bed is set against one wall; a set of drawers and a large wardrobe provide the other furnishings. There is nothing of real value here.</p>\n<h4>9. Servants’ Quarters</h4>\n<p>This large room contains four beds, only two of which have been occupied recently (by the servants lying dead in the dining room). The room is not as well furnished as the rest of the house, but still represents very good servants’ accommodation.</p>\n<h4>10. Corridor</h4>\n<p>This corridor separates Klauss and Ernest’s bedrooms off from the rest of the house, providing them with more privacy. As with the hall and balcony, the floor is covered with blue carpet. Two paintings hang on the walls, worth approximately 7 GCs each.</p>\n<h4>11. Master Bedroom</h4>\n<p>This is the largest bedroom in the house, and is where Klauss usually sleeps. An ornate rosewood cabinet is set against the wall opposite the four-poster bed, together with an equally ornate set of drawers and a spacious wardrobe. The drawers are all filled with personal belongings and clothes, but a successful <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test made while searching the wardrobe turns up a false bottom concealing a secret compartment that contains @Pay[28gc,25ss,300bp,SPLIT]{28 GCs, 25 shillings, and 300 pence}.</p>\n<h4>12. Ernest’s Bedroom</h4>\n<p>This isn’t quite as luxurious as the master bedroom. It is relatively sparsely furnished with a single bed, a wardrobe, and a chest of drawers.</p>\n<h4>13. The Cellar</h4>\n<p>This stone-flagged room is filled with barrels and casks containing a wide variety of fine wines and ales. A flight of stairs leads up into the kitchen in one corner; in another corner a flagstone has been lifted out of the floor, revealing the entrance to an old, long-forgotten tunnel that leads into the sewer system. This is the way @Actor[wFCHWhunTVhrta7c]{Tavelli} and company gained entrance to the house; neither Klauss nor Ernest knew of its existence. If Tavelli has already rejoined his companions, the flagstone has been replaced, and a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test is required to find the hole — assuming the searcher has a reason to suspect such a tunnel must exist (for example, having heard the grating sound of the flagstone being pulled back into place).</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/skaven-shield.webp\" width=\"287\" height=\"298\" /></div>","folder":"k5awwFCu3Hu4rO1g","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Ritual","sort":300000}}}

The Characters can make a good impression on her in passing, perhaps by dealing with a disturbance that threatens her safety or that of her charge, or just the reputation of the city in the eyes of a distinguished visitor.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have already made a good impression on @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} or @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen}, and proved themselves discreet and trustworthy, they might be introduced to Emmanuelle as people who could help with whatever has been making Emmanuelle so depressed lately.

She can also provide introductions to any of the ladies-at-court, to @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} the minstrel, and — once again, only if she trusts the Characters implicitly — to a former lover, watch @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Commander Schutzmann}. @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} is another old friend, and if she thinks he can help the Characters she may introduce them.

If the Characters are hired by the city’s military establishment for any kind of covert activity, it will be von Genscher who is in command of the operation. He will probably deal with such Characters directly, for security reasons, and will arrange things in such a way that he can deny all knowledge and association if things go awry. </p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>All three have houses close to the @JournalEntry[asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials}. Schutzmann has an office in the Watch headquarters nearby; Schwermutt in the East Gate; and von Genscher close to the palace.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Characters may make Leadership tests in place of Charm tests if their Leadership skill is higher than their Charm skill. Schutzmann respects Dwarfs and Sigmarites, who gain a +5  Fellowship bonus when talking to him.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>The Marshals avoid politics, and are quite unaware of the intrigues behind the taxes. They are all aware of the Graf ’s withdrawal, and have recently taken to discussing matters of security with @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Baron Heinrich} rather than his father. They are unhappy about the taxes, knowing how they might weaken the city, but do not see it as their place to comment.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>The Marshals’ duty is to protect the city from military threats. Political threats are completely outside their purview. They will absolutely refuse to undertake any military action within the city, or to do anything else that smacks of a coup. This includes lending the Characters any military personnel or equipment, or granting them any military rank or authority.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>Because of their wish to avoid politics, the Marshals are only slightly acquainted with the other major NPCs, and do not cultivate relationships with them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Shrewd and able, but stingy with defence funding. Always demands very precise cost estimates. They have not met with him recently, and have not noticed any odd behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Undefeated for four years, he is a fine advertisement for the warriors of Middenheim, and always willing to help out with training troops.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Pleasant, but not a close acquaintance. Schutzmann has heard that he is ‘not reliable,’ but is unsure what that means; von Genscher likes his music; and Schwermutt recently saw him mimic the @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Knight Eternal} at a cabaret club, and rather likes the Elf.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘Princess’</strong>: She seems a nice enough girl, if a bit dim.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: They know her only by reputation, as a respectable and devoted chaperone.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: They meet with them occasionally to discuss routine security matters. High Wizard Helseher’s views are respected, and Schwermutt will commend Janna Eberhauer her as showing great promise.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: The Marshals avoid discussing religious matters: Schwermutt follows Ulric, Schutzmann follows Sigmar, and von Genscher keeps his views to himself, believing religion to be uncomfortably tied up with politics. In any case, they know almost nothing about him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ybdS4Z0pbWL8oiND]{The Paramour} and @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Publicly, the Marshals know nothing of court affairs, and have no interest in gossip. Secretly, though, von Genscher’s son is having an affair with Petra Liebkosen, and Schutzmann had an improbable liaison with Emmanuelle Schlagen some years ago, which he is trying very hard to forget. If he is specifically asked about her, a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test will reveal that Schutzmann is uncomfortable with the subject, but not why.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: They all think him a fool, and know he is widely ridiculed, which reflects poorly on other military men, including themselves. They would be happy to see him gone.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Schwermutt occasionally has a drink with the Elf; they all think him honest and clever.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: No direct dealings. To Schwermutt, he seems a fair enough representative of mercantile interests, but Schutzmann has heard rumours of crooked dealings, and even a claim that Wallenstein has been involved in an illegal slave trade. Von Genscher is uncertain, but will point out that nothing was proved and no charges were brought.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: They dislike his reputation, but von Genscher has seen that @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Baron Stefan} seems more tranquil lately. Despite all else, the Tilean may be a good thing for the Graf 's family.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: The Marshals actively avoid the Law Lords to maintain a respectable separation between the military and judicial arms of Middenheim’s government. As far as they know, the Law Lords are men of integrity and wisdom, even if Ehrlich’s melancholy sometimes keeps him from his duties.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Watch Commander Schutzmann respects Breugal in an abstract way: he is a lackey, but a senior one, and carries out his duties with devotion and ability.

He may be interested in any proof that the taxes are part of a plan to weaken the city, but requires convincing proof before he acts.</p>\n<p>Janna Eberhauer is more active socially, and can be encountered at various artistic events around the city. She is fairly approachable, especially if one or more Characters have taken the trouble to join the guild since arriving in Middenheim. She is not interested in romantic advances, but listens to any Character who speaks to her as a respected wizard. She also gives the benefit of the doubt to anyone who is brought to her by her sister @Actor[ThOmnHA3l1Slh78K]{Erina}, who is staying at the @JournalEntry[ieHrUyFz83TkBikg]{Templar’s Arms} when the scheduled event @JournalEntry[YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{‘Chaos Strikes by Night’} takes place. If the Characters can convince Janna that there is a sinister plot behind the new taxes, she reviews their evidence carefully. She takes it to Helseher, if she thinks it is sufficient to convince him to act; if not, she advises the Characters on how to proceed, whom to cultivate, and what information is needed. You should take care not to let her operate the party by remote control, though; she should be a useful source of hints rather than a skeleton key to unlock the whole adventure.</p>\n<p><strong>Introductions</strong>: Janna can provide an introduction to @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Helseher}, but only if she thinks the party has irrefutable evidence to support their assertions.

{"_id":"psXuT1bdpkGb3898","name":"Down Among the Dead Men","content":"<p>This encounter takes place in or around Morrspark at night. The Characters spot two figures in the shadows, either coming out of a family crypt or heading away from the Morrspark. They are carrying something that looks remarkably like a body wrapped up in sack-cloth.</p>\n<h3>Spotted!</h3>\n<p>If the Characters challenge the grave robbers or otherwise make their presence known, the thieves drop the body and run for it, quickly losing any pursuit in the streets of the @JournalEntry[EwI0966tcHzz44lk]{Westor}-@JournalEntry[9S51a44wvQCES1CR]{Sudgarten}district and heading back to Ostwald. The Characters can call the Watch, who quickly summon a priest of Morr to the scene. After about half an hour of making statements and tying up formalities, the Characters are rewarded with @Credit[10gc SPLIT]{10 GCs} by the @JournalEntry[u9uiiDA6oT5T8U6a]{Temple of Morr}: the standing reward for thwarting body-snatchers and Necromancers.</p>\n<h3>Trailing the Thieves</h3>\n<p>If the Characters follow the grave robbers, they see them load the body into a small cart hidden on a side-street off the West Weg. The thieves drive off across the city, through a maze of side-streets. They cross @JournalEntry[limbxI1PZjhVzBy8]{Ulricsmund}, @JournalEntry[QYipS3tpaNBDgKsN]{Geldmund} and @JournalEntry[2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt}before pulling up at a building in the Freiburg, where a third figure waits in the shadows to receive the body.</p>\n<p>The Characters can call the Watch at this stage if they wish. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Bribery</strong> or <strong>Charm </strong>Test is necessary to persuade the Watch to raid the house. If this is successful, the Watch — perhaps with the Characters close behind — discovers the body and catches the miscreants red-handed. The Characters are rewarded with @Credit[10gc SPLIT]{10 GCs} as above: this is the standing reward, and is not negotiable.</p>\n<p>Instead of calling the Watch, the Characters might decide to stake the house out, or to break in and find out what is going on. If so, the GM has to decide precisely what that is. Some possibilities follow. </p>\n<p><strong>Forbidden Research</strong>: The body is being delivered to the house of a Necromancer. The premises are guarded by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.jfMhkQGzjFWDxVOm]{Cultists}. The Necromancer herself will be alerted by sounds of combat, and will attempt to use magic to kill, and preferably reanimate, the Characters.</p>\n<p><strong>In the Name of Science</strong>: The body has been delivered to a physician or scholar, who wants it for dissection and research. The house is quiet; servants have been given the night off, and encouraged to visit relatives in other parts of the city, but a few students might be in attendance. The grave robbers lock the body in a laboratory in the basement. Other than the Grave Robbers, the housekeeper has the only key. </p>\n<p>There is an operating table in the laboratory, and shelves around the walls are stacked with limbs and organs in pickling jars. If discovered, the physician or scholar tries to buy the Characters off, starting at @Credit[10gc EACH]{10 GCs each} and bargaining upwards as the GM sees fit. Even if the Characters accept the bribe, they may still have a later encounter with a band of footpads whom the physician or scholar hires to kill them and recover the money. If the thugs fail, the increasingly paranoid dissectionist may even go so far as to hire an assassin.</p>\n<p><strong>A Quick Exit</strong>: The ‘body’ is not really dead. Someone — a cultist trying to escape from their cult, a character on the run from a gang, or anything else you care to think of — has staged their own death with the aid of a coma-inducing drug. Shortly after burial, the ‘body’ is recovered by hired grave robbers (who do not know the full story) and delivered to an alchemist or pharmacist, where the antidote is administered. The fugitive is then smuggled out of the city to begin a new life somewhere else. When the Characters break in or the Watch raids the house, they find no body, just a semi-conscious patient receiving treatment. This leaves the Characters with some fast talking to do.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>If the Characters bring the incident to a satisfactory conclusion, they should be awarded @Exp[20,Down Among the Dead Men]{20 Experience Points} each, with bonuses as usual for clever ideas and engaging roleplaying.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/morrspark.webp","folder":"S7FLDHVd3EvKK0o9","sort":410938,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Cameo Adventures","sort":410938}}}

{"_id":"rGe8KWINgeT7XRrq","name":"Sascha Rothbert - The Fixer","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/sascha-rothbert.webp\" width=\"271\" height=\"271\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>Rothbert is one of @JournalEntry[CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{‘The Man’s’} most valued lieutenants, charged with resolving problems bothering the crime lord. This includes gathering information, ensuring rivals are removed, acquiring stolen goods, or bribing officials. He rarely gets his own hands dirty, preferring to procure the services of fences, smugglers, or other ruffians to get the job done.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Rothbert lives in rooms above the Dying Manticore inn in @JournalEntry[06LuFlBESLckr28m]{Ostwald}. During the day, he moves between various establishments affiliated with @JournalEntry[CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{‘The Man’} — such as the @JournalEntry[qp2neyvPkCmid7yj]{Drowned Rat} inn or @JournalEntry[xfvpYN2PCWDGVEb7]{Pfandleiher’s Pawn Shop}. But often he can be found in any other part of the city, meeting contacts and making arrangements. In the evening, he frequents inns and taverns where he can discover interesting information and people.</p>\n<p>Given recent events, Rothbert keeps a low profile as he goes about his business. He won't announce his presence, and Characters looking for him will likely need to make an arrangement to meet in advance.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Rothbert normally gets on well with strangers — after all, any of them could prove useful in the future. But now he’s nervous that anyone could be a cultist. All Fellowship Tests are at –5 for Humans and Elves until he trusts them, which happens after three successful Tests. Dwarfs and Halflings do not suffer this penalty as the cultists he saw were all man-sized.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Rothbert has a reasonable understanding of who influences the Graf, based on scraps of gossip he’s picked up and his own educated guesswork. Assume he knows who to target for influence, explaining it to the party by moving beer tankards representing the main players around on an inn table.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Rothbert thinks that the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court} have considerable influence over the Graf; he believes the Graf can’t resist a pretty face.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Rothbert wants to keep his boss happy, so he’s working to see the tax repealed and to improve his own relationship with members of the court. But he has a more pressing goal: to find out whether the cultists are after him and, if so, what he can do to stop them. </p>\n<h3>Influence</h3>\n<p>Rothbert has never met the Graf and people like him have no influence whatsoever on his opinions.</p>\n<p>Pressure Points</p>\n<p>Rothbert is well known, but after witnessing a Purple Hand ritual he feels like a hunted man. Unbeknownst to him, the cultist did not recognise his face. But if @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} realises that Rothbert saw the ritual or is working against his plan, he will have him killed. So far, Rothbert’s natural distrust of the authorities has prevented him from approaching them with what he saw. He dare not tell @JournalEntry[CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{‘The Man’} in case someone in the organisation hears and decides to sell him out.</p>\n<h2>The Opinions Of Others</h2>\n<p>As a fixer, Rothbert has met more of the major NPCs than one might expect. Certainly he’s a criminal, but he presents as fairly respectable and moves easily in different kinds of company.</p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion: Met Sascha once when visiting a horse trader. He couldn’t quite work out why he was there, but they got on well enough.</p>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel: Sascha has been part of Rallane’s audience and the Elf has drunk with him on occasion as part of a larger group. Rallane doesn’t remember much about him, other than his face.</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone: The Chaperone would never entertain the idea of conversing with a criminal such as Rothbert. She might change her mind if she realised he knows about her nephew Bruno Kohl.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}: Rothbert has several wizardly acquaintances at the Guild, who sometimes look to ‘The Man’ and his agents to source rare or illicit spell ingredients. Eberhauer knows him, but politely ignores him in public.</p>\n<p>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}: Schlagen remembers Rothbert as someone who occasionally hung around with her old theatrical friends. She’s wary of spending time with anyone associated with that time in her life. While she enjoyed it, she’s moved on. The other Ladies at Court do not know him.</p>\n<p>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt: The Elf knows Rothbert as a casual acquaintance who can be good company and always knows a good hostelry when they need one.</p>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor: He’s worried about Rothbert and ‘The Man’, as they know some of Gotthard’s dubious practices and criminal connections. If he could find a way to neutralise them, he would.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician: He likes Rothbert, as he’s always up for a drink and he knows some interesting people.</p>\n<h3>The Other Npcs</h3>\n<p>As someone who makes a trade of knowing things, Rothbert has good insights into the NPCs and several routes to introduce the party to Middenheim’s upper echelons.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: He’s heard that the Chancellor has picked up a nasty drug habit, but doesn’t know where he’s getting his supply. Josef Pfandleiher once sourced some dodgy antiques for the Chancellor and Rothbert can use his connection to the pawnbroker to engineer an introduction.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: Rothbert knows that he wants to get into the horse trade and met him through ‘Bolgasgrad’ Vadim, a horse trader. He likes Dieter and suspects he can be easily fleeced.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: He likes the Elf and has hung around on the periphery of a few nights out, buying the odd drink and keeping his ears open. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: He’s admired her from afar, but never got anywhere near.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: He knows that her nephew is ‘a bit of a naughty boy’ and can use this as leverage to get the party an introduction to Zimperlich, or help them arrange a diversion to get her away from the Katarina.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: ‘The Man’ and other ne’er-do-wells would pay handsomely for compromising information on Schutzmann. Otherwise, Rothbert has avoided all three of the Midden Marshals like the plague.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: He knows a crooked wizard who helped steal a few books from the Wizards Guild library on his behalf, as he had a buyer in High Priest Etelka Mueller. The wizard, a Shadowmancer called Jurgen Monilus, can introduce the party to the High Wizard for a small price. Rothbert himself won’t go, as he’s wary of wizards. He thinks they can read minds and suspects some of them could be cultists.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: When an Ulrican priest wears a wolfskin, they are expected to have killed the wolf themselves. On several occasions, Rothbert has arranged the sale of freshly killed pelts to priests who are too busy or scared to do the deed themselves. If he wants to pull in a favour and enable a meeting with Ar-Ulric, he might be able to make this work.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: He knows her from her old acting days, when she hung around with a much more disreputable crowd. Rothbert is impressed at her social climbing and bears no ill will, but if he needs to use his old connection to get the party an audience with the paramour, he will.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} – Knight Eternal</strong>: No dealings with him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: They have been occasional drinking companions whenever Allavandrel ventures to the less salubrious parts of town for entertainment. Although he won’t show it, he doesn’t like the Elf as much as Rallane, because he finds him unnervingly perceptive.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Rothbert has discovered that Wallenstein is involved in dubious dealings such as human trafficking and even worship of the Ruinous Powers. He fears that the merchant was one of the cultists he saw and Rothbert avoids discussing him until he feels completely at ease with the party.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: He caused quite a sensation when he arrived in the city — not least because his largesse attracted a great number of hangers-on. They’ve never met, but Rothbert knows exactly where to find Pavarotti on any given evening.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: He doesn’t have much interest in them — they’re cold fish and he believes that there’s not much to know about them. He does know Hultz Fleischer of Klaglich’s gang and knows that he found a decent job recently working for some cunning woman, but he has no knowledge of the link to Wasmeier.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Rothbert will be at the following events, checking out the crowd and talking with acquaintances.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Gymnasts}; @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Minotaur fights}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf ’s Champion}; @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Fire-breathers of Carroburg}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Horse Fair} (with ‘Bolgasgrad’ Vadim); @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Barnumbel’s Elephant Show}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Black Pool Illuminations}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Cup Final}</p>","folder":"udGynnL2hxddlr6Q","sort":700000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":700000}}}

{"_id":"ri289tDcFl3qOsaT","name":"News and Rumours","content":"<p>These rumours may be heard along the road, at any of the various stops along the way, or from fellow travellers. Roll a [[/r d10]] to choose randomly, or pick a rumour appropriate to the NPC in question. While rumours of strife and taxation in Middenheim serve to set the mood for the rest of this adventure, be sure to pepper in some talk of civil unrest in the Empire as well. This foreshadowing will serve you well should you carry on into <strong>The Horned Rat</strong> and <strong>Empire in Ruin</strong>, the final two chapters of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As Ostland and Talebecland stand on the brink of open war, rebellion is brewing in Middenland. The Emperor’s tolerance of mutants has angered the fierce Sons of Ulric, and now the most devout among them are seeking to drive all other priests from Middenheim, to make it Ulric’s city alone.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Emperor has summoned all his military commanders to the palace to discuss the problems in Middenheim. He has also demanded that Graf Boris Todbringer, the Elector Count of Middenheim, join him in the capital immediately.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Emperor’s infamous mutant decree is an attempt to avoid open war with Middenheim. Why, everyone knows the Beastmen of the Drakwald were once as Human as Graf Boris himself. Mutation’s spreading across the province, as though some strange influence were at work.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The rats of Middenheim’s sewers are not like any rats found in the south. Full 6 ft long, they are — and some of them stand upright, wear clothes, and talk to each other in squeaks and chitters. Middenheim’s rat catchers earn their pay, and no mistake!<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Mutants and bandits continue to attack coaches passing through the Drakwald. The major coaching companies are hiring extra guards, the Roadwardens are recruiting in Altdorf and the surrounding area, but the Emperor has failed to send troops to protect the highway. Meanwhile, streams of refugees leaving Middenheim are at the mercy of bandits and beastmen.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The followers of Ulric are becoming even more militant. Not content with persecuting honest and devout Sigmarites, now they have begun picking on the priests of every other deity — and even on the Dwarfs, who helped build Middenheim. A ruinous series of tax laws has been passed, targeting Elves, Dwarfs, wizards, and priests, in particular.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>All these new taxes can mean only one thing: the Graf is filling his coffers to hire troops and mercenaries. He may be preparing to intervene in the growing conflict between Ostland and Talebecland — or he may intend to break with the Emperor, and fortify the north banks of the Reik and the Talabec against southern aggression.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>A heresy is being bandied about, claiming that Sigmar was never a god — just a mortal hero crowned as Emperor by the high priest of Ulric. They claim that Ulric is the true god of the Empire, and Sigmarites are heretics. Tension between north and south comes and goes, but all the bad feeling seems to be coalescing around religious differences. Some Ulrican fanatics even want the north to break with the rest of the Empire and become a separate nation.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Ar-Ulric has not made any statements about the heresy or the activities of the fanatical bandits who call themselves the Sons of Ulric. He has condemned their suggestions that he consider abdicating so that one of them can take his place, of course. He has said their belief that they descend from Ulric is highly apocryphal, and he supports the Graf in outlawing their public assembly in the city, but when it comes to their persecutions of Sigmarites in Middenland he keeps his mouth shut.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The mother-in-law of the informant’s cousin is a washerwoman at Castle Reikguard. She reports catching a glimpse of Crown Prince Wolfgang, ‘<em>and he was more Wolf than Gang, if you take my meaning</em>.’</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Characters may pick up the following information in the city, either through conversation with Middenheimers or by overhearing conversations. Note: It should be credible that the NPCs in question were able to have heard whatever information they pass along. For example, no grubby local peasant knows of distant Imperial machinations, while educated merchants or guildsmen are unlikely to recount mere superstition.</p>\n<p>Some of these rumours carry on stories that the Characters may have heard during <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>. Where necessary, the GM should fill in any missing details from previous stories that the Characters somehow missed.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">The Empire</h3>\n<p>Despite their sometimes dour attitude, Middenheimers love to gossip, especially about the lax ways of anyone not from Middenland, and especially during Carnival. Roll [[/r 1d10]] or choose an appropriate rumour for each situation. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Emperor Karl-Franz’s condition has become critical. His illness has been common knowledge for some time, but now it appears that he has deteriorated. Court physicians have been working with the Magicians’ Guild, but have failed to discover the nature of his illness. And who deals with important matters of state during this crisis? No one. The discontent in the capital is increasing, and spreading through the provinces even now.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Grand Duke Gustav von Krieglitz of Talabecland has sent emissaries to the palace of Grand Prince Hals von Tasseninck of Ostland. The Duke denies the accusation about the murder of von Tasseninck’s son, Hans. He is also angered by recent attacks on his border patrols by the Prince’s soldiers.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Baron Heinrich has been sent on an important diplomatic mission. He’s off to Wolfenburg to try to talk some sense into the von Tassenincks. I heard he’s going to ask them to withdraw any suggestion that von Krieglitz harmed the Crown Prince’s son. Tricky situation, but if anyone can talk Talabecland and Ostland out of a war it’s our Heinrich.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Baumann’s Blitztruppen, an elite mercenary unit, has been recruiting new members for an unknown mission in the eastern Empire. Baumann himself left the city weeks ago. Whether this has anything to do with a sudden increase in cattle rustling, crop burning and transport disruption raids on the Ostland border, nobody is prepared to say. Local militia there have been preoccupied with the sudden increase in refugees from the mounting cycle of raid and reprisal.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Emperor’s edict forbidding the slaughter or exile of mutants in the Empire hasn’t been received well. Some villagers have been hanged for murder under the new law. Only a couple of weeks ago, villagers from the Reikland rioted after an innkeeper was convicted of murdering a guest who was found to have scales on his back.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The chief representative of the Middenland Farmers’ Association, Dietrich Hoffman, was in town the other day. He made a statement to the council forecasting gloom and doom for this year’s harvest. Apparently, the harvest reports  seem to be the same across the Empire. This year the weather is to blame: too cold in winter; too wet in spring — so they say. But then, farmers are always moaning, and nobody can remember the last time they made an accurate forecast.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Marienburg seems to be the place for traders at the moment. Business is booming, and looks set to rise further over the coming months. The port is operating at nearly full capacity, and orders for grain from Bordeleaux are at record level.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Emperor’s chain of signal towers traces a very sinister pattern on the map. A cousin of the informant’s brother-in-law works as a cleaner at a wizard’s house, and has picked up a thing or two. Something very bad will happen when they are all completed — something very bad indeed.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Wagons have been seen going into Castle Reikguard more often than usual, and in greater numbers. Crown Prince Wolfgang is clearly stockpiling vittles and munitions — he must be plotting rebellion!<br /><br /></li>\n<li>That’s just irresponsible conspiracy nonsense. Really what he must be doing is getting ready to support the Emperor in an attack on Middenland!</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/wolfs-pelt.webp\" width=\"204\" height=\"204\" /></div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Middenheim</h3>\n<p>Middenheim may be an unfamiliar and sometimes odd place, but its denizens are rightly proud of it and always happy to talk about the city, its history, and people. Pick @Roll[1d13]{randomly}, or choose an appropriate rumour to be overheard about Middenheim itself.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The annual wizardly illuminations might not be so grand as they have been in years past. This Scroll Tax has been an unpopular move, and Peter Kramer, a popular Wizard who led the annual ‘Red Arrows’ flying display for years, has left the city.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Have you noticed how more Dwarven establishments seem to be closing down since the introduction of the Dwarf tax? Strange thing is, few Dwarfs have been seen leaving — either by chair-lift or the main roads. Some say they have hidden themselves away in the ancient tunnels under the city.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Have you seen how the priests of Sigmar and Ulric treat each other recently? Only the other day, a fight broke out outside the Templar’s Arms when some priests of Sigmar blamed the High Priest of Ulric for introducing the Temple Tax.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The city’s defences are not as strong as people suppose. Too much attention has been paid to the dubious benefits of magic. The Dwarfs are undermining them anyway, with all their tunnelling. At least the magicians are finally getting their due — now the military realises how little help they have been.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>If you want to earn some easy money over the coming days, take up busking. During Carnival, any fool with a fiddle and a voice can make enough to live on.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The new taxes have been introduced so that the Graf can mount a campaign against the Emperor. Apparently, the recent edict on mutants convinced Graf Boris that old Karl-Franz had gone senile at last.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>They’ll be wanting a new Law Lord soon if old Ehrlich doesn’t pull himself together. This must be his third fit of melancholy since he took office. I’m surprised Hoflich hasn’t already got rid of him. Not the most compassionate type, that Hoflich.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>There were witch hunters up from Altdorf the other week. They burned 17 people at the stake for being Chaos-worshippers and witches! Why do the Graf’s people need Southerners to do this? Aren’t they able to root out followers of Chaos themselves? The Emperor’s people don’t trust us to keep our own house in order. Those witch hunters would have been just as content burning good Ulricans, if not more so!<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Someone from the Emperor’s court was in Middenheim recently, and they brought a detachment of southern knights with them as a bodyguard. Some say it was the high priest of Sigmar — or the Grand Theogonist, begging his eminence’s pardon — come to talk to Ar-Ulric about all this religious ill-feeling that’s been brewing. They’ve gone now, and good riddance, but the Emperor would do better to forget about religion and treat us Middenlanders with more respect. Ulric was here before Sigmar — everybody knows it!<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Beastmen have been coming closer to the city. Eating the corpses dropped off the Cliff of Sighs, most likely. Some of them have even been killed in the Undercity by sewer jacks and rat catchers. They say the things all had rat heads, but who knows for sure? When the only tools you’ve got are a ratting pole and a rabid terrier everything looks like a rat.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Middenheim’s Dwarfs engineered a marvellous flying device in gratitude for the sanctuary the city afforded them for over 2500 years. Even Dwarfs respect that sort of history. A dirigible they call it, it’s like a balloon with a steam engine bolted on. Baron Heinrich graciously received it and took it straight to Ostland with him. Shame you missed the day he left, the sight of him and a small squadron of Knights Panther rising up into the air was magnificent! Of course, no sooner does he leave than these taxes come in. Now the Dwarfs want their balloon back.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>If I was the Graf I’d hire mercenaries to sort out this farce on the border. Brass Keep, you heard about it? A cohort of mutated Norsemen called the Blighters have been holed up in there since the time of Magnus the Pious. Ought to be straightforward to winkle them out, but the job got wound up in politics. The Kärzburdger family own that land and won’t allow decisive action to be taken. They say the place is cursed, and that it’s better to contain the problem rather than put an end to it. They put up a picket to starve the Blighters out. Two hundred years later the Blighters are still there, and so is the picket.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The Kärzburdgers used to run things in Middenheim, but they’ve fallen a long way these last two centuries. The old Kärzburdger Graf let himself be dragged by the ear by the cult of Shallya, literally, and they’ve never lived the humiliation down. We’re blessed to have a ruler like Boris Todbringer, he’s a rock. If only he’d have more legitimate children.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/ulric.webp\" width=\"202\" height=\"243\" /></div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">For Adventurers</h3>\n<p>There is always work available for those handy with a sword, and it may be a task that is suitable for one or more of  your Characters. Note: be aware that some of these rumours may send your Characters scrabbling away from the main plot, but used carefully they can nudge your players in the right direction. Roll [[/r 1d10]] and choose randomly if you wish, but it is advisable to pick a rumour appropriate to your game.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Want to earn some extra money? Well, forget trying to sign up with the militia. After last year’s near-riot after the Snotball final, ‘Iron-Head’ Schutzmann has already hired an extra 400 men to help police the city. They say he has spent almost the entire year’s budget on Carnival Week.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Have you heard how all the Dwarfs are leaving? Well, someone’s going to keep all those tunnels checked — they’ll be crying out for soldiers who aren’t afraid of the dark, preferably short.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>If you want a taste of the high life, rumour has it that Graf Boris wants to marry his daughter off as quickly as possible (nudge, nudge).<br /><br /></li>\n<li>More Road Wardens are being hired for journeys to Marienburg, Erengrad and a few of the northern coastal villages. Things are never perfect, but the roads are getting worse by the month. Twice this month, an expected shipment of Kislevite vodka has failed to arrive.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Any experience of rat-catching? Have you noticed how fat and sleek they are at the moment? Want to know why? The Dwarfs have been storing food down those tunnels of theirs, and the rats have found it.</li>\n<li>Some very well-to-do folk are visiting Middenheim during the Carnival, and most are looking to hire guides and guards. The opportunities for money-making are good, especially since the City Watch is so strapped for cash it can’t afford extra workers.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>I’ll tell you of a quick way to earn a Crown or two. Dress up as one of the Watch and go knock on some noble’s door demanding taxes. Do it early in the morning — you’d have him giving you his daughter before he’s woken up.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Here’s a good one: some young ’uns reckon that Chancellor Sparsam is taking a cut from the new taxes and stashing it all in his house. They reckon doing it over will net five grand! They’d be lucky to net five pennies: Sparsam is such a miser any money will be locked away where Ranald himself couldn’t get at it.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>They say that Baron Stefan is actually getting better! Ulric knows what that mad ‘Doktor’ is dosing him with — still, like as not he’s simply half-dead from being crammed full of poultices. What else could be done with him?<br /><br /></li>\n<li>If you can read and write well, get a job in the Taxation Komission. They’re crying out for scribes, what with all these new taxes. Of course, the basic pay is terrible, but with all the overtime you can rake it in. Mind you, I wouldn’t tell the Dwarfs about it; they’re liable to string up anyone connected with the taxes!</li>\n</ol>","folder":"tp4QvOHx22sG8xK2","sort":450000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":450000}}}

Alternatively, bribery may work, even for a non-noble, but it will not be cheap.</p>\n<p>In addition to the non-lethal combats, there is much attention to formalities, and any participant without @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (Nobles)} Talent stands out like a sore thumb. A gang of young nobles will probably turn on the ‘peasant,’ who is turned over to the militia without a second thought. All competitors must have their own warhorse, squire, full suit of (shining) plate armour, lance, hand weapon, and heraldic banners. The gift of a favour from a sultry and aristocratic member of the audience is also desirable.</p>\n<p>The actual jousting is fairly tame, but looks very dramatic with plate-clad jousters charging at each other on fine warhorses. The jousters continue the contest until one is forced off his or her horse: this occurs when one jouster beats the other by at least 4SL on an <strong>Opposed Melee (Polearm) Test</strong>.

Primitive fireworks are also used (but not while any wizards are flying!), though everyone knows they’re nowhere near as good as ‘real magic.’ Most of the fireworks simply explode with lots of bright light and deafening noise, but recent advances have resulted in the spectacular ‘<em>Star-Spirals</em>’ and ‘<em>Dragon-Breaths</em>.’ During the displays, the Watch is on full alert to spot any fires that may develop in the city.</p>\n<h4>This event is attended by the following NPCs</h4>\n<p><strong>Konigstag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulric Schutzmann}</p>\n<p>@Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Maximillian von Genscher} (9–10)</p>\n<p>@Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}.</p>\n<p>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert}</p>\n<p><strong>Angestag</strong></p>\n<p>@Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}</p>\n<p>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}.</p>\n<p>@Actor[KZjUllCfHJl4kZ2F]{Thognar}</p>\n<p><strong>Festag (Grand Finale)</strong>:</p>\n<p>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</p>\n<p>@Actor[R6QIMHeODOglwptt]{Johann Schwermutt}</p>\n<p>@Actor[Xu5TUwZaftYtbCeX]{Maximillian von Genscher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}</p>\n<p>@Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen}</p>\n<p>@Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich}</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</p>\n<p>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}</p>\n<p>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti}</p>\n<p>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller}</p>\n<p>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/schedule-the-great-park.webp","folder":"Kt6NUOTEx9m4NDNu","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Carnival Events","sort":0}}}

Nastassia reports to @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Baron Heinrich} by pigeon, although the two meet in person at various locations around the city — including in the palace itself. If she wants to meet the party, she will find them. She lives alone in a small, neat and impersonal house in @JournalEntry[limbxI1PZjhVzBy8]{Ulricsmund}.</p>\n<p>Outside Middenheim, she can be encountered in any large town or city where political or military decisions are made. In Altdorf, she runs a spy network from a front organisation, the @JournalEntry[Salzenmund Export Company], which operates from an office in @JournalEntry[Grandmarkt].</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>Nastassia is untrusting by nature, so most people suffer –5 to Fellowship Tests with her. If she decides independently that the Characters are working for the interests of the Todbringers (whether they realise it or not), they gain +5 to Fellowship Tests instead.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Nastassia makes it her business to understand who has influence on the Graf, so she has in-depth knowledge of the internal politics of the court. She is one of the few who recognises the impression that @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} has made on the Graf.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Nastassia slightly overestimates the influence of @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} on the Graf ’s decisions, in part because she has not realised how the latter’s depression has muted his faith.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Nastassia has several related goals. She believes that there’s a plot against the Graf, but wants to understand the full extent of what’s underway. Then she naturally wants to foil whatever is planned and capture or eliminate the instigator. Her personal goal is to best @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich}.</p>\n<h2>The Opinions of Others</h2>\n<p>Nastassia has maintained a careful anonymity. Few who have met her know just who it was they were speaking to. While a few might recognise her as someone they have seen about the palace, none have formed much opinion of the woman. Indeed none of the major NPCs aside from @Actor[0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich Todbringer} even know her name.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>During her investigations, Nastassia has acquired a wealth of intelligence on the behaviour and secrets of the other NPCs. She can feed this to the Characters during the adventure, but be careful not to overuse her and remove the need for them to investigate themselves. She should point them in the direction of clues rather than hand out facts.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: Until recently he was a dull but dependable servant of the Graf, but now he’s a drug addict who has lost his way. Nastassia knows that ‘Frau Kenner’ is the dealer, but she doesn’t know where Sparsam meets her. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} – Champion</strong>: She’s observed him closely and likes him, seeing nothing negative in his character. She sees that he plans to give up his role. She is surprised that he supports the tax and suspects the hand of Klaglich is behind this — but she hasn’t discovered the hypnotism.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: He’s not stupid enough to have proposed the tax, but doesn’t seem to mind that they’ve been introduced because he doesn’t like Dwarfs. His friendship with Emmanuelle Schlagen is interesting and it seems that he knows about her affair with Ar-Ulric.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: The Princess is more intelligent than she likes to show, but she does have a soft spot for handsome, romantic men. Other NPCs might dismiss her as foolish, but the Graf pays more attention to her opinions that most realise.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: Nastassia thinks that the Chaperone’s over-protective character is beneficial, even if she finds her annoying and small-minded. She has discovered that Zimperlich’s nephew is a drug dealer who works from the Pit, and that Zimperlich has disowned him.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: She thinks that they are a competent, trustworthy bunch and has advised Heinrich accordingly. She knows that Schutzmann had a liaison with Emmanuel Schlagen in the past, which he prefers to keep quiet about.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: They’re good people and loyal to Middenheim — so it’s no surprise that they’re furious about the tax. Nastassia thinks they’re a little naive and detached from political reality.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[O1WGhtHQNazslML1]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Nastassia is a moderate Ulrican, troubled by the knowledge that the head of her cult is having an affair with the paramour. She does not support celibacy and has long favoured him as head of the cult, so she worries that if he was exposed, a more fanatical Ulrican could take his place.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ybdS4Z0pbWL8oiND]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} – the Paramour</strong>: Nastassia knows that she’s having an affair with Ar-Ulric and worries that Emmanuelle’s dominance of the priest will come to no good. </p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{The Ladies at Court}</strong>: Nastassia uses Petra as a source of information, meeting her in disguise and paying her for court gossip. She knows that Natasha worships power and has kept an eye on her.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[2aOu8k1gNO1UgasZ]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} – Knight Eternal</strong>: Nastassia can’t think of a use for Prunkvoll. If the party spend too much time with him, she can warn them not to waste their efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[685Ck5A8zUzAXGKQ]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: She realises that the Elf has no interest in politics and little influence on the Graf. But he is a useful person to know and a potential ally for Heinrich’s aims for a unified Middenheim, so she has watched his dissolute lifestyle with (misplaced) concern.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[idp5Wb1CqoKl7iev]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: Nastassia has been completely taken in by Wittgenstein’s misdirection. She thinks he has reformed from a shady past and become a genuinely good person in his role in the Merchant’s Guild — even making anonymous charitable donations. She suspects that someone is trying to frame him for corruption. If you need to throw the party off Wittgenstein’s scent while the events of Power Behind the Throne unfold, Nastassia can provide them with reassurance. She will later discover the truth and chastise herself for being outplayed.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: Nastassia knows Pavarotti is trustworthy — he’s trying his best to help Stefan. In the guise of Ursula von Lupe, she met him in Miragliano during a mission abroad. She knows that, below the fun-loving surface, he’s a good man, an accomplished sea captain, and an expert hypnotist.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: There’s something up with Ehrlich — the tax isn’t the kind of thing he’d normally support and he hasn’t been seen in public for a little while. Wasmeier unsettles her, but she can’t work out why.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Working from the shadows and in disguise, Nastassia can be present incognito at any Carnival event you want, observing the party and other NPCs and providing information where you deem necessary.</p>","folder":"udGynnL2hxddlr6Q","sort":800000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":800000}}}

Its controller can see through its eyes, but not hear. Active control of a skull requires concentration, which is broken if the controller is disturbed in any way; the skull then switches to passive mode, and seeks to carry out the last command it was given or, at the GM’s option, return to its controller.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive</strong>: When the skull is carrying out instructions out of sight of its controller, or when its controller is in direct control of another skull, its eyes dim noticeably. When it completes its most recent orders, it becomes dormant.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormant</strong>: When a skull is not under direct control and has no orders to carry out, its eyes do not glow. It seeks to return to the cave immediately; if unable to do so, it simply orients itself to face the cave. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test while moving a captive skull permits the Characters to notice this phenomenon. If a localised source of Chaos (say, a small fragment of warpstone) is brought within five yards of a dormant skull, it orients to that instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Dead</strong>: When the skull reaches 0 Wounds or has been away from a source of Chaos (the cave, a piece of warpstone, or anything else the GM chooses) for more than 24 hours, it simply becomes a normal skull.</p>\n<h3>Tracking a Skull</h3>\n<p>Although the skulls do not travel fast, they are able to fly, which makes conventional tracking impossible.

Finding a pretext for an appointment requires ingenuity: the Characters could try posing as wealthy merchants or antique dealers.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Females</strong>: +10 to all Fellowship Tests when Sparsam is under the influence, –10 when not intoxicated. Sparsam is normally timid with anyone he finds attractive.</p>\n<p><strong>Academics</strong>: Characters whose Intelligence exceeds 40 may use this instead of their Fellowship score adding the advances from any appropriate social skill. Sparsam values intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: –10 to all Fellowship Tests. Sparsam is apprehensive about their reaction to the tax changes.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Sparsam knows the political system well, but is not a good judge of people. He can be helpful to Characters in matters of protocol, explain how to reach other NPCs, and may provide a crucial pass to the Inner Palace.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Sparsam believes that @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Pavarotti} has no influence on Graf Boris. This is only wishful thinking.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Sparsam’s main goal is to maximise public funds: the tax changes seemed good until he saw the reactions of those affected. He would try to repeal the laws — if he were not being blackmailed (see Deadly Secret: A Powder Problem, below). He collects antiques and enjoys discussing them with other enthusiasts.</p>\n<h3>The Other Npcs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Indifferent; hardly knows him.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel}</strong> <strong>— Minstrel</strong>: Indifferent; hardly knows him</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer}</strong> <strong>— ‘Princess’</strong>: When forced to interact with her he is awkward but flattering. He knows that she does not like him. Secretly he thinks she is vacuous and dull.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich}</strong> <strong>— Chaperone</strong>: Fears her malice, and worries that her gossip-mongering might create social traps for him. Their mutual detestation is irrational, but they can hardly conceal it.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: No particular personal feelings. The military always want more money, of course, and Sparsam moans about this at length.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Normally has no dealings with them, but recently had to endure the wrath of Deputy High Wizard @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} about the Scroll Tax. Having taken a dose of stimulant to fortify himself for the meeting, Sparsam made an ill-judged advance for which the enraged magician threatened to turn him into a rat. He is now terrified of her, and highly apprehensive of High Wizard @Actor[sN0PeIFSOidPua1f]{Albrecht Helseher}.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Dislikes him. He has noticed the High Priest’s agitation, and thinks Ar-Ulric may share his addiction. Sparsam has occasional paranoid fantasies about this sort.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour</strong>: Thinks she is frivolous, and knows she makes sarcastic jokes behind his back. He has been dreaming up a jewellery tax in revenge. Does not know that she is Graf Boris’s paramour, nor is he aware of her affair with Ar-Ulric.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Also frivolous. Sparsam resents their allowance from the Treasury (300 Crowns per year, though he will never disclose this). The exception is the icy @Actor[7ggdqHZxId697kT5]{Natasha Sinnlich}, for whom he is developing a hopeless and somewhat pathetic affection. He made intoxicated advances to @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} at a recent feast, but remembers nothing of it.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</strong> <strong>— Knight Eternal</strong>: Knows him slightly through their shared interest in antiques. Thinks he is a fool, but respects him as a symbol of strong, lawful authority. At least he isn’t frivolous.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: Allavandrel has always been kind to the Chancellor, rescuing him from many painful conversations at the social functions Sparsam dreads. Sparsam is not one to express affection openly, but he is glad that the Elf is around.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Admires him for his tireless and persuasive advocacy of merchants’ interests. They have sherry now and then, and discuss trade. He regards Wallenstein as ‘a stout fellow,’ and knows nothing of his connection with the Chaos Cult of the Jade Sceptre.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Embarrassed and disturbed by his impulsive forthrightness, and thinks him ‘a thoroughly bad lot’. However, his mild fear of the man means he will not express his opinion unless certain that Pavarotti will not hear of it.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Considers all three to be ‘intelligent chaps’. Works closely with them to plan and draft laws relating to the city’s finances.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Knows Breugal by sight, but has never conversed with him. To Sparsam, Breugal is just a part of the palace furniture.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>He’s seen her in the company of the @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{Law Lords}, but has no real opinion of her and finds her a little intimidating.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch:</strong> Rather fond of her, as she petitions him gently on behalf of the poor. While he doesn’t provide much support, he enjoys her attention.</p>\n<h3>Deadly Secret: A Powder Problem</h3>\n<p>About ten months ago, the Chancellor saw Law Lord @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} inhaling a white powder. Saying it was a simple tonic, Wasmeier offered some to Sparsam, who found its effects beneficial. Wasmeier introduced him to ‘@JournalEntry[jepWFu96Qh64OlHw]{Frau Kenner}’, who has kept him supplied with it since then. Unknown to the Chancellor, the doses he received were spiced with some highly-addictive extras. When Sparsam became worried, Wasmeier waved his concerns away, saying that @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.jTFOrokjEHbi12rT]{Ranald’s Delight} was completely non-addictive unless abused. This astute reply played on Sparsam’s puritanical character, and the guilt-ridden Chancellor is now convinced that his own moral weakness created the problem.</p>\n<p>Initially in favour of the tax changes, Sparsam changed his mind at the first demonstrations, but as soon as he voiced his concerns, Frau Kenner told him that her supply depended on his continued support of the taxes. If challenged, Sparsam will either leave or have the Characters thrown out, but he will be grateful for a friendly, sympathetic ear. If questioned gently, Sparsam will eventually break down: between sobs, he expresses guilt over his addiction, and the trouble he has caused by supporting the taxes. If the Characters have not offered to do so already, Sparsam will implore them to help him.</p>\n<p>All Sparsam knows about Frau Kenner is that she visits him once a week, the next visit is due on the last day of the Carnival. He describes her as ‘about 30, 5 and a half feet tall, with long blonde hair.’ Sparsam will also inform the Characters that he gave her a pass to the Inner Palace.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Recitals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Exhibition of Heraldic Arts}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 1)}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Ring of the Nibble Unger Lied (Part 2)}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/josef-sparsam.webp","folder":"So1PdVn4b7FXXZLo","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"u0jibG3CVNoLK6GT","name":"The Story (Flying Death Skulls)","content":"<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">FLYING DEATH SKULLS</span></h3>\n<p><em>This adventure is based on Carl Sargent’s ‘The Grapes of Wrath’, which was written for WFRP first edition to cover the gap between the end of <strong>Death on the Reik</strong> and the start of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. Originally printed in </em>White Dwarf<em> issue 98, it was reprinted in <strong>The Restless Dead</strong> for first edition and adapted for the second edition rules in <strong>Plundered Vaults</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><em>This new version forms the second chapter in the saga of the Gravelord, whom readers first encountered in <strong>Death on the Reik Companion</strong>. Like that adventure, this can be used as an optional sub-plot to enrich <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, as part of a separate ‘Gravelord’ mini-campaign, or as an adventure in its own right.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Story</h2>\n<p>After taking a humiliating revenge on @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.bUxA8zyayMarTXP7]{Father Marcus} and his monks in @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.wIbYy6PUBKFdJvPF]{‘Vengeance of the Gravelord’}, Hans Gräber moves north to settle another old grudge in a village on the way to Middenheim. Purely by coincidence, the vine-growing village of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} also lies on the Characters’ journey, and they become entangled in his plans once again.</p>\n<h3>Past and Present </h3>\n<p>The origins of the current trouble lie three years in the past. A young @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Hans Gräber}, passing through Pritzstock on his way to Altdorf and initiation as a novice monk, caught sight of the beautiful @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau}, the wife of village mayor @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} and partner in his wine business.</p>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} fell hard for the beautiful wine merchant, mistaking her polite and somewhat motherly concern in his increasingly drunken state for romantic interest. When she could no longer fend off his clumsy attentions, her husband and a few villagers stepped in and treated the besotted postulant to a cooling dip in the village pond.</p>\n<p>Utterly humiliated, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} left the village before dawn, and joined his order as planned. The pain of his humiliation never abated, and neither did the memory of the woman who (in his mind) clearly led him on just to make him the village laughing stock. Having dealt with @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.bUxA8zyayMarTXP7]{Father Marcus}, revenge on the village of Pritzstock became his next priority.</p>\n<p>In his research and wanderings, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} had begun to compile a grimoire of necromantic magic, and its contents include a strange and varied array of spells. One of them, picked up in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.o2mz58EtayxnAJNY]{Grey Mountains} from a rotting parchment whose seller claimed it had come from the time of Heinrich Kemmler himself, enchants the skulls of people and animals and turns them into flying servants and emissaries. With his usual imagination and dramatic flair, Gräber is using these simple creations to conduct a reign of terror in and around @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}.</p>\n<h3>A Matter of Time</h3>\n<p>The @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gravelord} is striking at a vulnerable time. Depending on when you set this, it is either budding time, when the vines come out of their winter dormancy and require careful tending to ensure the next harvest, or harvest time. The following text assumes that the adventure takes place at harvest time and will have to be amended slightly for the spring: in either case, there are only a few critical days to do what needs to be done, or the next harvest is ruined — and with it, @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock’s} prosperity for the next year or more. With the village cowering under a necromantic threat, time is of the essence. The atmosphere in the village becomes increasingly desperate as the days pass.</p>\n<h2>Running The Adventure</h2>\n<p>The adventure is set out as follows. After an initial encounter, the Characters arrive in the village. There is a section on Pritzstock’s main NPCs: what they do, who they are, what they know, and suggestions on how they respond to various actions and conversation. This is followed by descriptions of @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} and the cave where he has made his base, as well as the other adventurers’ camp.</p>\n<p>@Scene[9qBXM8BnsfoP9zEh]{Midddenheim Surrounds} shows the layout of the villages southwest of Middenheim. At the start of the adventure, the Characters are travelling to Middenheim by coach, along the Altdorf–Middenheim road. The woods through which the road runs are known to harbour many dangers, so coaches travel quickly and avoid stopping.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Tuning the Challenge</em></h3>\n<p><em>By the time your Characters have are on the road to Middenheim, they will have been through a lot, with experience and skills to match. Depending on your party composition, you might find some of the NPCs and creatures depicted here to be outmatched by your group.</em></p>\n<em>You will find that some of the actors have two versions</em><em>. Pick the one which will present your group with an appropriate challenge. This is something that you will have to determine for yourself to some degree. There is no 'typical' <strong>WFRP </strong>group, and so creating one size fits all encounters can be difficult. A party might be all battle-hardened Soldiers, Witch Hunters and Knights, or it might be three Halfling Pedlars and a Human Graverobber who just wanted to get to the Schaffenfest. Choose wisely, and remember that making things too easy and robbing your group of meaningful challenges to overcome is just as bad as making things too hard. After all, if you make a mistake Characters have Fate points for a reason.</em></blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/coach.webp\" width=\"633\" height=\"358\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/flying-death-skull.webp","folder":"XPM9XriCft4SkXW7","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":-100000}}}

He has modest influence (1 vote).</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Rallane lives in the @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{Outer Palace}, where his house is always open to visitors. He visits numerous Carnival events, and is much in demand at private functions. He may play at high-class hostelries (on a whim, or for a fee), and has been known to perform impromptu in the parks. The Characters might also find him being chased through the streets by an irate group of Dwarfs, who pelt him with garbage: they can win his gratitude by helping him out. In short, a very accessible NPC.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Females</strong>, <strong>Elves</strong>: +10 to all Fellowship Tests (+15 for a female Elf ).</p>\n<p><strong>Dwarfs</strong>: –15 to all Fellowship Tests. Rallane finds them crude.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Rallane is one of the few NPCs who knows that @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} is the Graf ’s paramour. He also suspects that she is having an affair with @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}; he saw signs of a romance some six months ago, and signs of tension more recently. Initially, he put this down to guilt on the part of Ar-Ulric, but recently Rallane has sensed that all is not well at court, and he wonders if the Priest’s behaviour is connected in any way.</p>\n<p>He is puzzled about @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer’s} speeches in favour of the Dwarf Tax. If the Characters have established cordial relations with Dieter as well, he may subtly question them to find out whether they too have noticed the incongruity of Dieter liking this tax when he admires Dwarfs.</p>\n<p>Rallane has many useful contacts, and knows Middenheim very well. His intuitive feeling that something is amiss may help spur the Characters into action.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Thinks, wrongly, that @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel}, the Master of the Hunt, has influence with Graf Boris. Once, when depressed following a romantic setback, Rallane told Allavandrel that he was glad that the two of them were close to the Graf; Allavandrel chose not to depress him further by telling him the truth.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Rallane likes the Dwarf Tax, and is neutral towards the others. However, it is rumoured (especially among the city’s Dwarfs) that it was Rallane who first suggested the Dwarf Tax. Although he is too proud, and dislikes Dwarfs too much, to deny it to the Characters (at least initially), Rallane is unhappy about this, and would like to clear his name.</p>\n<p>He realises that the taxes are socially divisive and, increasingly convinced that all is not well in Middenheim, he fears that worse may be on the way. He wants to find out what is wrong and try to put it right, and he is willing to help the Characters do so.</p>\n<p>He has no purely personal goals (apart from keeping his job, which he likes), but he might easily become fond of any female Character with a half-way decent Fellowship score, and an easygoing manner.</p>\n<h3>The Other Npcs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor:</strong> Hardly knows him. Dislikes his formality, has not noticed any odd behaviour, and does not suspect his addiction.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion:</strong> Long-time friend and drinking companion. He thinks Dieter and @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} make an excellent couple, but fears that their marriage might stop Dieter carousing with him. Puzzled by Dieter’s espousal of the Dwarf Tax, but has not pressed the issue. Will not say anything which might cast any suspicion on Dieter.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — ‘Princess’:</strong> Hopeless infatuation: Rallane knows that no Elf could marry into the Todbringer family for myriad reasons, but he still entertains the occasional romantic fantasy. He sees her fairly often, and sometimes plays music in her chambers.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone:</strong> Dislikes the ‘crabby old harridan,’ but grudgingly admires her selfless devotion to her charge.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: Does not know them. Suspects that @Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}, the Graf ’s current paramour, had a lover within the higher echelons of the military before she became involved with Graf Boris, but does not know who (see @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann}).</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Has no dealings with them, but knows High Wizard Albrecht Helseher by reputation as a formidably intelligent man. Has noticed Deputy High Wizard Janna Eberhauer at court functions, but has no — yet.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Will say that he is a sound enough fellow, but a successful <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> test will detect a somewhat flat tone to his voice. He suspects the priest is involved with the Graf ’s paramour, and fears the possible political consequences of the affair. Angry at the man’s foolishness (Rallane never blames the female party). Suspects that the High Priest’s obvious agitation is due to being found out, perhaps by one of his junior priests.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen} — Paramour:</strong> Sympathetic, protective, and absurdly soft-hearted about her. They had an affair some four years ago, but will certainly not mention this to the Characters.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: Rallane likes @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung} very much. He knows that Petra Liebkosen is extroverted and flirtatious, but thinks (quite wrongly) that she is sensitive and vulnerable underneath. He dislikes Natasha Sinnlich, and suspects her of a cruel nature (correctly), but does not say so initially.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal:</strong> Thinks him an utter fool, and mocks him in private. His mimicry is deadly accurate and quite merciless.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt:</strong> A close friend and Elven brother-in-arms. The two enjoy reminiscing about old times (very old times by human measure), singing together (Allavandrel has a passable voice), friendly archery contests (Rallane is skilled with the bow after all), drinking, and romancing.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor:</strong> Knows him only by reputation: that he argues for the interests of merchants very capably and lives pretty well. Does not suspect him of anything.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician:</strong> Knows him only slightly. Aware of his unsavoury reputation, but likes his impulsiveness and flamboyance. Rallane has noticed that poor Baron @Actor[dfVVZJ41NVDpWkNy]{Stefan} seems calmer and happier with ‘Herr Doktor’ looking after him, on the rare occasions when he sees the baron.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Rallane does not know them, but believes them to be capable men, even if he dislikes their formality. He thinks they are too dull to be dishonest.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} </strong><strong>— </strong><strong>The Fixer:</strong> Sascha has been part of Rallane’s audience and the Elf has drunk with him on occasion as part of a larger group. Rallane doesn’t remember much about him, other than his face.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Exchanges a polite word with Breugal in passing, and makes sure to keep on his right side, but secretly finds his dress and manner ridiculous.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>He’s never met her and hears that she’s no fun.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>He knows she’s a good person, but finds her very dull.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Gymnasts}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Festival of Fine Ales}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Gymnasts}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Archery Tournament}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Challenges to the Graf’s Champion}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Quarter-FInal 2}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Elven Lightsinger}, @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Water Polo Tournament}, @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{Snotball Final}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 Festag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Pageants and Jousting}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool (Grand Finale)}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/rallane-lafarel.webp","folder":"So1PdVn4b7FXXZLo","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":-100000}}}
{"_id":"uRYJa7d36ckfIw6S","name":"The Traitor Flees","content":"<p>Law Lord @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}, Magister Magistri of the Cult of the Purple Hand, has decided to flee.</p>\n<p>When things went wrong at the Palace, he had the option of staying in the hope that the attempt to assassinate @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} was successful. However, at the back of his mind was the possibility that @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} had been captured, in which case his own identity might have already been revealed.</p>\n<p>Wasmeier thus decided to quit the Palace and move to his town house; a much safer place, where he could start gathering information on events in @Scene[sM08FHbv8ah59TM0]{the Palace} and the city. Wasmeier reasons that if his own involvement has been discovered, a troop of armed guards will come after him, forcing him to flee. On the other hand, if the @Actor[APciWLQRdUsuUWdd]{Doppelgänger} succeeded and @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} was dead or free, then Wasmeier could resume his role of Law Lord once more with nobody the wiser.</p>\n<h3>Wasmeier’s Apartment</h3>\n<p>There is no incriminating evidence here apart from examples of the Law Lord’s handwriting for comparison with the note sent to the Hoflich-Doppelgänger. An empty vial beside a small pile of ashes will be spotted on a successful <strong>Hard (–20) Observe</strong> Test: these are the remains of the potion and scroll Wasmeier used to make his escape.</p>\n<h3>The Graf’s Command</h3>\n<p>The Characters have been instructed to deal with the traitor Wasmeier. They may be willing to do this, but they are faced with a few minor problems.</p>\n<p>For a start, one or more may be wounded from encounters earlier in the evening. @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Deputy High Wizard Eberhauer} can help with magical healing, and at the GM’s option she may cast some protection Spells on the Characters as well.</p>\n<p>If the Characters need any particular weapon or armour, assume that the Palace Guards can oblige by lending pieces of armour (chain mail only), hand weapons, and shields.</p>\n<p>The final problem will be reaching @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier’s} house, since in all probability none of the Characters will know where it is. Members of the Watch will escort them there.</p>\n<p>@Actor[2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich} will give the party a Middenheim Seal that identifies them as important servants of the city, but apart from this no direct assistance will be forthcoming from either the military or the wizards.</p>\n<p>The Watch is already at full stretch policing the Carnival. They  fear that isolating Wasmeier’s house may provoke a riot, if people are prevented from returning home, especially after a long day at the Carnival. Also, at the back of their minds is the possibility that the planned replacement of the Graf was merely a prelude for some kind of uprising or assault, for which they will need all the strength they can muster.</p>\n<p>The wizards, on the other hand, are keen to get back to the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Guild}; Wasmeier was a trusted member of the Guild Council, and the spellcasters wish to begin checking up on any harm he may have caused there. At your option, an NPC such as @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter} or @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane} may volunteer to go with the party if they have befriended them earlier in the adventure.</p>\n<h3>Wasmeier’s Town House</h3>\n<p>This is situated in the @JournalEntry[8rK4NSrDXCpSKRSH]{Grafsmund}-@JournalEntry[aFOxMajVoBKRHinu]{Nordgarten} district. @Scene[UzUaqY37Y7WVKKmy]{Wasmeier's Town House} shows its general layout. As might be expected, the house is solidly constructed and well-maintained; it is worth something in the region of 4,000 GCs. All the windows are shuttered and barred (T 3, D 6), and all external doors are bolted (T 4, D 10). Unless stated otherwise below, internal doors have no locks or bolts.</p>\n<h4>Side Garden</h4>\n<p>This is well-maintained, with a fine selection of plants. In particular, the area near the kitchen is well stocked with herbs. The back gate is locked, and is the only direct access through an archway in an 8-ft high wall (18” thick). There is a gravel path around the edge of the house and stable; it is raked daily by Hawk the gardener, and is noisy to walk on (–2 SL to <strong>Stealth</strong> Tests). During the night a @Actor[K2hVEs8D1LajfuMg]{dog} belonging to the @Actor[5KIUihsaj8b0q6pb]{cook} prowls in here, and will begin barking if disturbed.</p>\n<h4>Front Garden</h4>\n<p>One area is devoted entirely to richly-scented roses, and a climbing variety grows up a trellis attached to the stable wall. A large fish-pond contains about a dozen Two-bearded Mulus. The gate to the garden has substantial bolts, but is open. The path to the front door, like that in the garden, is made of gravel.</p>\n<h4>Hall</h4>\n<p>A sturdy front door leads to a stone-floored hall with fine hardwood panels on the walls. The front door has a large brass knocker in the shape of an open hand that can be heard throughout the house. Decorations in the hall include two suits of full plate armour, a number of impressive-looking two-handed weapons plus large paintings of country scenes. In winter time, the hearth will contain a blazing log fire.</p>\n<p>One suit of armour will fit a character 5’ 8” tall, of average build and weighing 140–150 pounds, while the other will fit a character 5’ 11” tall, of heavy build and weighing 180–190 pounds. Both have been made for display rather than practical use, and despite their normal encumbrance they provide only 0/1 AP as if they were made of leather.</p>\n<p>The weapons on the walls consist of two two-handed swords, one two-handed axe and one two-handed flail. Again, all are made for display, and suffer a penalty 1 of –10 to hit and –1 damage.</p>\n<h4>Library</h4>\n<p>This is very well-stocked with books on law, history, geography, and other dry, non-fictional subjects. The doors have locks (CR –20) but are unlocked. A highly-polished wooden floor fills the room with the smell of varnish.</p>\n<h4>Lounge</h4>\n<p>This room is thickly carpeted and draped in various hues of purple. Six plush armchairs take up a lot of the floor space, and by each is a small table. A cabinet on the south wall contains spirits, liqueurs and glasses, and beside stands a bookcase with some light reading: historical novels, collections of folk-tales, bestiaries, and such. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test will reveal that the bookcase is hinged, and forms a secret door to the stable.</p>\n<h4>Dining Room</h4>\n<p>The central area is given over to a fine oak table with chairs for a dozen people. The rest of the room has cabinets for silverware, glasses, fine Bretonnian porcelain, and so on: enough for a decent banquet. Fine, but faded, tapestries line the walls. The room has an exit onto a patio through a pair of glass doors (<strong>TB 2, W 2</strong>) which is locked (<strong>D +20, SL 0</strong>) and bolted on the inside, covered by heavy drapes.</p>\n<h4>Kitchen</h4>\n<p>A typical layout is seen here, with tiled walls and floor. The cook @Actor[5KIUihsaj8b0q6pb]{Swelt Tunger}, keeps the place immaculately clean and very well stocked. The only (live) animal allowed in the place is his pet dog, @Actor[K2hVEs8D1LajfuMg]{Growler}. Tunger has a small room off the kitchen. The door to this, like those to the cellar and garden, is generally locked (all <strong>D +20, SL 0</strong>). In addition, the kitchen door is bolted shut.</p>\n<h4>Cellar</h4>\n<p>Not shown on map. This is about 20-ft square, and has a small but fine collection of wine plus various foodstuffs in bulk: flour, sugar, cheese, and so on.</p>\n<h4>Stable</h4>\n<p>The north half of this building has two storeys, with the upper level being used as a hayloft. The place is also home to Hawk, who doubles as a gardener and stable-hand. A trapdoor and ladder lead from the hayloft to the stable area proper. Two fine warhorses, @Actor[23UqP4Uk1taS9t0z]{Thunder} and @Actor[5xx2E9gDl3oCNdAD]{Lightning}, are kept here. The rest of the space to the south is taken over by tools, plants, etc., plus an unusual wagon (detailed below). The main double doors are kept secure by a thick wooden plank; the smaller north door is also locked. There are two secret doors leading from the house to the stable. These only work from triggers in the house, and cannot be opened from the stable side.</p>\n<h4>The Battle-Wagon</h4>\n<p>This four-wheeled wagon is normally covered by a tarpaulin. It measures 9’ long and 4’ wide; its base is 3’ off the ground, and the wagon’s sides are 3’ high — except for the back side, which is 5’ high, hinged at the bottom, and can be lowered when required.</p>\n<p>The cart is special in a number of ways. All the wood has been treated to make it flame-proof; the sides have numerous small, sharp hooks that hamper anybody trying to clamber aboard, imposing a further –20 to all <strong>Athletics </strong>and other relevant Tests. Vicious, 6-in spikes protrude at right angles all along the circumference of each wheel, and a lever near the driver causes 2-ft blades to spring out from the axle of each wheel. These blades (which do not rotate) and the spikes (which do) cause [[/r 1d6 + 2]] damage to anybody who gets in the way of the moving wagon. The final feature is a false floor, metal-lined and packed with gunpowder — about 10 barrels worth in total! A ten-second fuse leads to a torch-holder on the driver’s side. This makes the wagon a large travelling bomb: the reason for this will become apparent.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: THE BATTLE-WAGON</em></h3>\n<p><em>Grognard players will surely remember Wasmeier’s battle-wagon, and they may send the Characters to his house prematurely in order to destroy it – and, perhaps, the house along with it. The grognard box @JournalEntry[Y2Tz145Dqgfl1Chf]{‘The Villain’} presents various options for punishing players who target @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} without collecting evidence, and it could be that the battle-wagon is in the house of another NPC altogether, leading to awkward questions when the Characters are caught breaking into the home of one of Middenheim’s esteemed Law Lords.</em></p>\n<p><em>Wherever the Characters find the battle-wagon, they may decide to destroy it before it can be used. If they have discovered that the body of the wagon is packed with gunpowder, all well and good: they will damage the house and possibly some neighbouring structures as well, but that is all within the scope of play. If they make the decision based purely on the players’ memory, though, the GM is completely justified in visiting a range of embarrassing consequences upon them.</em></p>\n<p><em>The fuse to ignite the bomb may not be where the players remember it being. Perhaps there is no fuse at all, and Wasmeier has cast a Spell which allows him to detonate the gunpowder with a command word.</em></p>\n<p><em>Alternatively, there is an obvious fuse, and it fizzes convincingly for a few seconds – but then it either goes out or lights the nearest lamp on the wagon’s body.</em></p>\n<p><em>Perhaps the fuse lights one or more lamps as above, but it also detonates the powder. It simply does so after a delay of five or ten minutes: this is Wasmeier’s estimate of how long it will take to drive from his home to the gates, but it is also just long enough for the Characters to light the fuse, run for cover, become curious that no explosion has taken place, and return to investigate.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Landing</h4>\n<p>A large skylight (bolted shut) provides light here and the place is decorated with potted plants.</p>\n<h4>Washroom</h4>\n<p>This contains two sets of wash-basins, towels, etc., plus a garderobe shaft leading to the drains below. Both doors have bolts, and the eastern door is also locked (count as a <em>Normal Door</em> for <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests).</p>\n<h4>Study</h4>\n<p>Unlike the rest of the house, this room is decorated to Wasmeier’s own personal tastes. The panelled walls are covered with various maps, royal lineages, historical timelines, and so forth. The floor is littered with various books, all concerned with Middenheim: history, law, religion, buildings, trade — every aspect of the city is covered. Wasmeier knows more about the city than anyone else alive. A huge throne-like chair of carved wood,  surrounded by all the books, sits in the middle of the room. The Law Lord has long dreamed of power, and seated on the chair he developed his evil plan of conquest. Both doors are always locked (count as a <em>Secure Door</em> for <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests).</p>\n<h4>Bedroom</h4>\n<p>A four-poster bed dominates the centre of the room. The floor is littered with the remains of half-eaten meals.The place has a rotten smell about it. The only clean items are Wasmeier’s clothes, which hang neatly in two huge wardrobes that cover the east wall. The south wardrobe has a false back, leading to the loft above the stable.</p>\n<h4>Guest Room</h4>\n<p>This is neatly furnished, and always clean and aired. A very fine full-length mirror is placed on the west wall (250 GCs).</p>\n<h4>Gaston’s Room</h4>\n<p>The domestic operations of the house are run by the butler/valet @Actor[R3XXfl4MATvenoqI]{Gaston}. His room, despite being small, is exquisitely well-kept. Everything is in its correct place, and not a speck of dust can be found.</p>\n<h4>Lurk’s Room</h4>\n<p>Two locked and bolted doors (count as <em>Normal Doors</em> for <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests) lead the way to the living quarters of @Actor[BlccBsLkU7lCPOEL]{Lurk} — Wasmeier’s one-man army. A drape covers the entrance to a nest of a place that Lurk uses for a bed. If anything, Lurk is even more untidy than Wasmeier in his eating habits.</p>\n<p>The bedroom also contains Wasmeier’s personal (count as a <em>Treasure Chest</em> for <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests) treasure chest. This holds coins to the value of 500 GCs and an equal worth of gems and jewellery, mostly obtained during his younger days as a Wizard. It also contains an enchanted amulet containing three @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.HpFkVJ2lYPAWumUL]{Great Fires of U’zhul} spells, which can be released one at a time by speaking a short trigger phrase inscribed on the back. Treat these spells as though they were cast with +5 SL. Along with this, an enchanted opal brooch containing the spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.9wmmln3DunIqGXM2]{Flight} (this works once and is cast automatically with +5 SL if the wearer falls more than 10 yds). Several grimoires and a sack of ingredients for all the spells he knows are in a separate compartment. Finally, it also houses Wasmeier’s supply of poison: 3 doses of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.qfd01sggD9xbCuJY]{Black Lotus}, 5 doses of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.5fowsr8vslorjeB2]{Mandrake Root}, and 7 doses of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.JbSjlgUdzsl5ok95]{Heartkill}.</p>\n<h4>Strong Room</h4>\n<p>The fortified door to this room has no less than three locks (count as a <em>Vault Door</em> for <strong>Pick Lock</strong> Tests). The only key to these locks is held by Lurk, although they are normally open.</p>\n<p>The room contains all of Wasmeiers material connected with the Cult of the Purple Hand: names of members, codebook, past activities, biographies, and notes on all the major citizens of Middenheim. If the party has played earlier instalments of the <strong>Enemy Within</strong> campaign, there are also copies of letters to Kastor Lieberung. Note that Wasmeier has never met Lieberung personally, and will not recognise a Character who has been impersonating him.</p>\n<p>Among the letters is an open envelope bearing markings of the  Four Seasons mail Service from Altdorf which contains @JournalEntry[FfgdX03BZTEA4hLr]{a letter} addressed to Law Lord Wasmeier.</p>\n<p>There is also a small aviary that houses carrier pigeons used to send messages to @Actor[b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Klaglich} — a small secret hatchway in the external wall is used for this.</p>\n<p>@Actor[BlccBsLkU7lCPOEL]{Lurk’s} job is to look after the pigeons and guard this room. At anyone attempting to gain access from the house, will have a barrel of flammable oil tipped over them. Then Lurk  sets it alight with a lantern always left burning for this very purpose. He then locks the door and throws the key out of a window.</p>\n<h2>Wasmeier's Henchmen</h2>\n<p>All these NPCs have keys to the parts of the house where they work, plus loose change to the value of 2–12 silver shillings. You should adjust their strength to suit the party.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/henchmen.webp\" width=\"237\" height=\"270\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[5KIUihsaj8b0q6pb]{Swelt Tunger, Cook, And Burglar}</p>\n<p>@Actor[K2hVEs8D1LajfuMg]{Growler, Guard Dog}</p>\n<p>@Actor[R3XXfl4MATvenoqI]{Gaston, Butler, Scribe, and Torturer}</p>\n<p>@Actor[GPmecH5STMzLNLc8]{Hawk, Gardener, And Poacher}</p>\n<p>@Actor[VFsw4ON2YyKZFdcE]{Sinistral - Hawk}</p>\n<p>@Actor[23UqP4Uk1taS9t0z]{Thunder} and @Actor[5xx2E9gDl3oCNdAD]{Lightning}, Warhorses</p>\n<p>@Actor[BlccBsLkU7lCPOEL]{Lurk, Bodyguard}</p>\n<h3>The Law Lord Waits</h3>\n<p>As soon as he arrives at the house, @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} will instruct his henchman to prepare for an attack. Remember, he may still be invisible due to the effects of the potion. All the staff will don armour and prepare weapons. Meanwhile, Wasmeier will get his magic items, spell ingredients, poisons, and gems from the chest in @Actor[BlccBsLkU7lCPOEL]{Lurk’s} room. Lurk will load the chest (and money) onto the battle-wagon, and then return to the secret room ready to destroy the contents if the house is attacked. The bodyguard places Wasmeier’s spell books in a haversack on his back.</p>\n<p>The remaining staff are also busy themselves with their assigned tasks:</p>\n<p>@Actor[5KIUihsaj8b0q6pb]{Swelt} will stoke up the kitchen fire so that he can sling a shovel-full of hot coals at an opponent. Treat this as an attack using  Swelt’s BS, with a range of 6 yards, doing 9 Damage and inflicting SL+1 @Condition[Ablaze] Conditions; the attack also has the Blast 1 and Distract weapon qualities. @Actor[K2hVEs8D1LajfuMg]{Growler} will be let out to patrol the garden area.</p>\n<p>@Actor[GPmecH5STMzLNLc8]{Hawk} hitches the horses to the battle-wagon and prepares for a getaway. He sets his @Item[I7JtbZtdm9q8SoYs]{man-trap} by the back stable door, covering it with straw and coating each of the jaws with a dose of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.qfd01sggD9xbCuJY]{Black Lotus}. The third dose is used to coat his rapier.</p>\n<p>@Actor[R3XXfl4MATvenoqI]{Gaston} waits in the lounge with @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, who by now has a sword coated with @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.qfd01sggD9xbCuJY]{Black Lotus}. Wasmeier casts any spells the GM deems appropriate in preparation for the coming fights. At the first sign of trouble, he flees to the stable: his henchmen each have one turn to reach the stable before he leaves on the battle-wagon. If dawn approaches, and no one has come to the house, he leaves anyway.</p>\n<p>The battle-wagon is built to be defended, and tactics will depend on just who managed to reach it in time. The rear side gives excellent cover against missiles from any pursuer, and the money may be used to cover its escape, with Wasmeier scattering gold behind the wagon so that any pursuers have to make their way through the resulting crowds. Wasmeier will head for the south gate, and once there will light the fuse and run for cover. The gates do not withstand the explosion and in the confusion Wasmeier and any henchmen will be able to get out of the city.</p>\n<p>The Characters will probably not have any horses but, as fate would have it, four mounted Watch members on crowd patrol approach the house soon after the battle-wagon left. Using the City Seal, the party can requisition the horses and go after Wasmeier. They will arrive at the south gate ideally just after the explosion.</p>\n<h3>Wasmeier At Bay</h3>\n<p>As the party emerges through the smoke and rubble of the ruined gate, they will see @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} about 50 yd away, standing alone in the roadway with any henchmen a few yards behind him. As the party approaches, the Law Lord will raise both arms aloft and utter a magical word of command — as one of the Inner Council of Wizards, he has access to the magical means of destroying the viaduct.</p>\n<p>With a huge cracking noise, a split will appear in the viaduct at his feet, spreading rapidly towards the city. Characters on the viaduct have two choices: run back or run forward. A 48-yd length of viaduct is affected, beginning at Wasmeier’s feet and travelling away from him. The section of viaduct takes one round to collapse fully, and if a Character is still in the area at the end of the round, they face a fatal 500-ft (167-yd) drop to the base of the Fauschlag rock.</p>\n<p>If anyone reaches @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier}, he fights to the death. If the combat does not go his way, he runs to the side of the viaduct and leaps over the edge. The Characters see him fall into darkness, but unknown to them, Wasmeier’s Opal Brooch gives him the power of flight. On the other hand, if Wasmeier defeats the party he heads towards the toll-gate at the other end of the viaduct. Using his natural authority as a Law Lord (since these guards know nothing of events in the city), he can order the gate to be opened to allow him through. In either case, Karl-Heinz Wasmeier will escape into the night, never to be seen or heard of again — at least not in the guise of a Law Lord of Middenheim.</p>","folder":"NdV140BH3D9p6vpI","sort":450000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 7: The Traitor Unmasked","sort":450000}}}
{"_id":"vJmImfkNn1DONyrZ","name":"The Graf's Garden Party","content":"<p>In Power Behind the Throne, the Graf ’s @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party} is only covered briefly. Taking place in the Royal Gardens from 2:00 to 8:00 p.m. on Marktag, it offers the Characters a golden opportunity to get to know many of the key figures at court who can help them resolve the plot of the adventure.</p>\n<h2>The Royal Gardens</h2>\n<p>Sometimes confused with the nearby @JournalEntry[PHMDyuBDTAHCFztS]{Konigsgarten}, the @JournalEntry[Zg4O0sojSzCr7wuU]{Royal Gardens} are in fact located within the palace complex. A broad and grassy inner courtyard with a formal shrubbery, a topiary garden, and a hedge maze in the form of a wolf ’s head, the whole area is crisscrossed by shining walks of marble chippings and dotted with statues.</p>\n<h3>Getting In</h3>\n<p>It is almost impossible to get into the garden party without a written invitation. These take the form of small scrolls sealed with the Graf ’s personal seal and addressed by name to the holder. There are several ways the Characters can get their hands on an invitation, both legitimate and otherwise. There are also a few plans that might suffice to get them inside. A few of the more obvious approaches are covered below: if the Characters try anything else, be prepared to improvise.</p>\n<h4>Who You Know</h4>\n<p>The Characters have already been in Middenheim for several days, and the Carnival has been under way for two. There have been some opportunities to meet some of the major NPCs and make a good enough impression to earn an invitation. Most of these are covered in @JournalEntry[zm2zG5Tw0uj9H3ao]{The Powers that Be} of <strong>Power Behind the Throne.</strong></p>\n<h4>A Reasonable Facsimile</h4>\n<p>If the Characters can get their hands on a genuine invitation (by stealing it from an NPC, for example), they can get reasonably convincing copies made in their own names if they know a good forger or have the requisite skills themselves. This involves an Opposed Test between the forger’s Skill and the Perception of an average palace guard (Perception 52). </p>\n<h4>Do You Know Who I Am?</h4>\n<p>Bluffing one’s way in takes considerable nerve and ability, but it is not impossible. Posing as a visiting dignitary from out of town with their entourage, the Characters may be able to bluff and bluster their way in without an invitation, even if their names (or those of their assumed personas) are not ‘on the list’. This only works if at least one of the Characters can successfully pose as a figure of Gold Status.</p>\n<h4>What’s it Worth to You?</h4>\n<p>Bribery is probably the least effective means to try. The palace guards and staff are all very well paid, so they do not need extra money and they stand to lose a great deal if they are dismissed from their posts — to say nothing of the possible charges of treason if their negligence results in a real or potential threat to the Graf or his family. All bribery attempts are <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong> at least.</p>\n<h4>Shhhh!</h4>\n<p>Stealth is also a risky tactic: anyone caught trying to sneak into the palace — garden party or no garden party — is regarded as a potential assassin and dealt with accordingly. The guards are trained to look out for potential threats (they make <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Tests to spot a potential assassin while on duty), and there are dogs and wizards in attendance, in case of magically invisible assailants.</p>\n<h4>The Entertainment</h4>\n<p>Characters with appropriate Skills may attempt to get into the garden party as hired entertainers. Perhaps they have been noticed while busking at the Carnival (see @JournalEntry[BRFG82wEhR3OCLzW]{The Crowds}), or perhaps they have had some other opportunity to impress someone who suggested them to Brueghal or some other person in charge of arrangements. The Character is invited to an audition, which takes place somewhere in the outer palace. This is the most demanding audition they have ever faced: all Tests are <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong>, as this is an extremely discerning audience.</p>\n<h4>Supplies</h4>\n<p>The garden party is being catered largely out of the palace kitchens, but there are a few suppliers who are bringing food, drink, flowers, and other items on the day, and if the Characters are clever and well-connected they may be able to gain entrance by posing as these suppliers. However, they find that all supplies must be delivered and set up half an hour before the party, and all suppliers and their staff are required to leave the garden immediately after their work is carried out. Finding an excuse to stay, or a place to swap clothes and assume a more fitting persona, will challenge the Characters’ ingenuity.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE HAND OF FATE</em></h3>\n<p><em>If the Characters have fallen at every hurdle and failed to find a way to glean an invite to the party, it is possible that one might fall into their lap. Someone sends a handful of invites to wherever the Characters are staying without further explanation. Who is this mysterious benefactor? None other than the Law Lord @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Hienz Wasmeier} himself, who wishes to get a look at the now infamous Kastor Leiberung and his companions first hand. If so, Wasmeier will attend the party brielf from 6.00 to 6.30, keeping mostly to himself.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>In Attendance</h3>\n<p>The following major NPCs attend the garden party, though not all are there for the whole time.</p>\n<h4>The Graf</h4>\n<p>For reasons explained in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris} is not himself, and has not been well for some time. He sits on a wooden throne in a small, open-sided pavilion, nodding absently to the arriving guests who bend the knee as custom dictates, but seemingly lost in a dark, brooding reverie. @Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal} the Chamberlain stands at his right hand, ready to carry out any order or to hurry away anyone who is annoying, boring, or tiring the Graf. The pavilion is flanked on either side by a detachment of six Knights Panther, and liveried servants scuttle to and fro, bringing food, drink, and other things that the Graf ignores.</p>\n<h4>Other Guests</h4>\n<p>The party is teeming with other guests, enjoying Middenheim’s social event of the year and taking care to see and be seen. These guests serve mainly as sources of overheard gossip and as obstacles, cutting in front of a Character to engage a dignitary in meaningless small talk just as the party was hoping to make an influential acquaintance, bumping drunkenly into a Character and accusing them of assault or pickpocketing, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Visiting Dignitaries</strong>: An embassy from Kislev is in the city, hoping to speak to the Graf about certain problems on their northern borders and remind him of a pact that gives Kislev the right to request a force of Knights Panther at need. There are also visitors from other cities in the Empire, and a few from other countries.</p>\n<p><strong>Prominent Middenheimers</strong>: In addition to the major NPCs listed above, the party is also thronged with Komission convenors, guildmasters, priests of various deities, and other members of the city’s upper echelons.</p>\n<p><strong>Strolling Players</strong>: Musicians and other performers have been hired or invited to entertain the guests. Minstrels, jugglers, and others stroll the ground, and a small, curtained stage has been set up opposite the Graf ’s pavilion for brief performances by several of the more highbrow entertainers who are performing at the @JournalEntry[VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music} and the @JournalEntry[Zg4O0sojSzCr7wuU]{Royal Gardens} during Carnival week.</p>\n<p><strong>Servants and Lackeys</strong>: Servants in the Palace livery move to and fro constantly, some bearing trays of food and drink that they offer to guests, and others collecting empty glasses and plates. Other servants patrol for dropped litter and keep an eye out for trouble. Meanwhile, the personal lackeys of several guests weave through the crowd, carrying messages from their master or mistress to some ally or paramour, or manoeuvring themselves into spots where they can eavesdrop on the conversation of a rival.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/whispers-in-the-maze.webp\" width=\"630\" height=\"335\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/whispers-in-the-maze.webp","folder":"qPMzSDu7RKbTDzy7","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"The Graf's Garden Party","sort":-100000}}}
{"_id":"xOLH8T4aTfPICuZE","name":"The Skull Hunt","content":"<p>If the Characters have behaved intelligently, they should find themselves hired to deal with the problem soon after reaching the village. The Characters have two days before the harvest is due to begin, and until this time the villagers have no real need to venture out. If the skull problem is not solved in that time, the villagers refuse to work the vineyards unless guarded by a personal escort: their livelihood may suffer, but it’s better than being killed!</p>\n<p>Even if the Characters are willing and able to guard the villagers, the harvest still fails, as tales of the flying skulls have spread and vital migrant workers have stayed away.</p>\n<p>The militia, led by @Actor[bnyNHCGyixKPSQOA]{Parzival}, is at the Characters’ disposal. However, despite their leader's urging, the militia have no desire to go skull-hunting, for glory, gold, honour, or for any other reason. Parzival therefore orders them to maintain a watch along the village boundary while he joins the Characters on their hunt. His boredom with village life has left him all too eager to engage the skulls and demonstrate the superior quality of Reikland nobility. He will be especially happy to accompany the Characters if any are Reiklanders themselves, and will ask for news of Ubersreik should they have any.</p>\n<p>The Characters should seek to achieve three objectives: learning about the previous sightings, trying to capture a skull for study, and tracking them to their point of origin. If they do not arrive at these objectives on their own, Parzival haughtily suggests them as the only 'obvious' course of action.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A SHARE OF THE PROFITS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Enterprising (or unscrupulous) Characters may try to haggle for a better price, especially once they realise that they hold the entire village’s hopes for the coming year in their hands. If they persuade Henri-Phillippe to offer a percentage profit from the harvest as payment (a <strong>Hard (–20) Haggle</strong> Test), the following sums are relevant. A good harvest nets @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} 500 GCs in one year’s time, rising by around 100 GCs for each extra year the wine is matured. Full maturity is reached in five years. Rocheteau opens negotiation at 30 GCs but may be bargained all the way up to 100 GCs if the Characters are truly ruthless.</em></p>\n<p><em>That is for immediate payment: deferred payments may be negotiated, based on the increasing value of the maturing wine, but the party must state how many years they wish to wait and undertake to return at the appropriate time to collect. For each harvest day lost, Rocheteau’s profit falls by about 10%.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Sightings</h3>\n<p>The previous sightings are covered briefly above. The Characters are quickly able to find the witnesses, and other villagers answer their questions once they know that @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} has hired them to resolve the situation.</p>\n<h4>Seel Baldurich, Village Brat</h4>\n<p>Seel is an obnoxious, snot-nosed seven-year-old. He was playing in the woods when he saw a skull at Location 1a on the @Scene[xCHI2UlFpaaUOflT]{Sightings map}, and ran back in fear. However, having been warned time and time again not to play so far from the village, he lied about its position, claiming that he saw it at Location 1b. Under close questioning, the Characters may make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test to realise that Seel may not be telling them the entire truth and, if  challenged, he admits to the deception. Seel is particularly enraptured by tales of adventure and swashbuckling action, such as fighting off Mutants after narrowly escaping a coach crash. If the Characters win him over with such tales, he opens up about his deception.</p>\n<p>Seel saw a skull heading away from him, that is all. However, his imagination has elaborated this quite a bit: ‘breathing fire’, ‘howling’, ‘covered in horns and spikes’, and so on. Since the young lad half believes this by now, it is up to the Characters to determine the truth of the matter.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[0eQzvUSeBpJGqrhw]{Isolde Gudhoffen}, Social Climber</h4>\n<p>Isolde’s encounter with a skull is Sighting 2 on the @Scene[xCHI2UlFpaaUOflT]{Sightings map}. She can only say that it appeared to be the skull of an animal. She is not sure, but if asked, she says that the thing’s eyes were glowing dimly. If taken back to the area, she is unable to locate the specific tree where she saw it, and searching the area reveals nothing of interest.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE FEMME FATALE</em></h3>\n<p><em>Any Character with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.6l3jvIAvrKxt0lA9]{Attractive} Talent or a Gold Status attracts Isolde’s interest, since she is seeking to get away from @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} and is impatient with @Actor[bnyNHCGyixKPSQOA]{Parzival’s} increasingly vague explanations for why he can't take them away to his holdings in Ubersreik to be wed. She will take the time to speak with any Character who appears likely to be able to offer her a rung up on the social ladder. If this has the effect of making Parzival jealous all the better, as she feels it will help to sharpen his mind on returning to Ubersreik with Isolde in tow.</em></p>\n<p><em>@Actor[bnyNHCGyixKPSQOA]{Parzival} has just enough nostalgia for his youth to think that a duel to first blood might be a suitable way to ward off any rivals for Isolde's affections — it is a small village, after all — and will issue a challenge to a Character if warranted. He favours a sword, and will provide one if his opponents lacks a suitable weapon.</em></p>\n<p><em>Unless taunted, Parzival will not fight to the death, and indeed things could get very bad for the Characters if he is killed. @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Rocheteau} dispatches news to Ubersreik at once, and the GM should follow this up as opportunity allows. </em></p>\n<p><em>While watching the duel, @Actor[0eQzvUSeBpJGqrhw]{Isolde} is surprised to find that she cares quite a bit more than she expected for @Actor[bnyNHCGyixKPSQOA]{Parzival's} wellbeing. Isolde lavishes praise on Parzival if he wins, and comforts him if he loses. If she feels the Character dueled him fairly, or perhaps even let him win, she will nod to them respectfully and view them favourably in the future. If however they wounded Parzival badly (4 wounds lost or more) or employed dishonourable tactics she treats them with contempt from now on.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Sigismund Halsbret, Missing Worker</h4>\n<p>One of the witnesses to Sighting 3, Sigismund decided to pack up and go. He worked at the Reuter household, and an inspection of his room (actually a corner of the hayloft) reveals that his clothes and his few other belongings have also gone. Sigismund’s employers considered him a lazy worker, and are not too distressed about his disappearance.</p>\n<h4>Knud Grapenpikker, Other Worker</h4>\n<p>Knud is the other witness to Sighting 3. He works at the Kallman farm and is somewhat obtuse, needing to be prompted often to reveal the little he knows. He and Halsbret were out working when they spotted a skull heading towards them.</p>\n<p>Sigismund started running, but Knud waited to hit it with his pet shovel, ‘Clod’. For whatever reason, the skull turned and flew back into the trees. Knud carries his shovel everywhere now, and even takes it to bed.</p>\n<h4>Erietta Surhardt, Unconscious Victim</h4>\n<p>This young woman currently lies unconscious in the Rocheteau house, tended by her mother and @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau}. She will recover consciousness in about two days, but will still be weak from blood loss. Successful mundane (a <strong>Challenging (+0) Heal </strong>Test) or magical healing restores her to consciousness, and an inspection (only to be carried out by a female Character, or a male who has thoroughly convinced all three women that he is a physician) reveals she was bitten twice.</p>\n<p>Erietta was attacked by surprise, and her only recollection is of ‘a gleaming white face with red eyes’ (Sighting 4 on the Sightings map). More information can be gained from her ‘rescuers’, Wanda and Hilda Klop and Imogen Uderlast. They heard a scream and ran to help, but on seeing a skull on Erietta they immediately ran away. Their courage returned when they saw the skull flying off into the forest.</p>\n<p>Wanda and Hilda are twins, and each habitually repeats what the other has just said by way of confirmation.</p>\n<p>Seeing Erietta and Elisabet together, any Character who makes a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test notices that they have a similar build and features: not enough to amount to a close resemblance, but perhaps enough for one to be mistaken for the other at a distance. This observation may not seem important at the time, but the GM may wish to point it out after the attack on the Rocheteaus’ house (see @JournalEntry[Yb6ew66hdbL4vBT3]{The Gravelord Responds}). Although only Gräber knows this at the moment, the attack on Erietta was a mistake. Seeing her in the distance, he mistook her for the woman who humiliated him on his previous visit.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder Lechart}, Village Fool</h4>\n<p>Unknown to anyone in the village — including himself — Wuder was one of the first people to see the skulls, although this was before they began to fly. Wuder was unlucky enough to end up in possession of a warpstone filling and this has left him both addled and with an unnearing sense for the presence of warpstone.</p>\n<p>@Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder} wanders freely around @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}, often roaming deep into the forest when the mood takes him. By chance, he came across the @Scene[gxjWgssIvXIUd2D7]{cave} containing the bones. While there, he picked up a small rock that fascinated him for no reason he could understand. It was a piece of warpstone, and when he thought he saw some of the bones move, he fled clutching the rock, keeping it as a lucky charm. Coupled with his filling, Wuder's exposure to corruption has been growing quickly, and it is only a matter of time before he mutates.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder} loses his ‘lucky charm’ (and he won’t give it to anyone without a struggle), he becomes very upset, and soon afterwards he sets off back to the cave to obtain another piece. Being so attuned to Chaos, he has no trouble locating it; curious Characters may profit from following him. However, if he does get a new piece of warpstone, he changes in new and different ways: @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.u7IJ1xm4pO5s9QgS]{roll for a three mutations}.</p>\n<h3>The Storekeepers</h3>\n<p>The snobbish and self-righteous Ludovic and Mathilda Reuter run the only store in the village. Items commonly needed by farming folk are stocked at normal prices and, since the village is quite prosperous, they also stock some fancy goods as well, though little of any practical use: folding card tables, toast racks, garden ornaments, and so on. These items are sold at 25% over the normal price.</p>\n<p>Mathilda is the village gossip, and if the Characters question her, they find that she knows many ‘truths’ about people in and around @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}. If stuck for a bit of gossip, she makes something up, usually something prurient and sensational that allows her to reflect piously on the state of the village’s morals: so unlike the decent lives she and her husband live. Here is a selection; the GM should feel free to add or elaborate as desired.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>RUMOURS</em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>@Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe} has a mistress in Altdorf and Middenheim. (False: he only has a mistress in Middenheim.)<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>@Actor[bnyNHCGyixKPSQOA]{Parzival Aschaffenberg} has been disowned by his family for an ‘indiscretion’. (False, but he did get a servant girl pregnant.)<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Knud Grapenpikker is wanted for murder in Middenheim. (False: Knud has never been to Middenheim.)<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>@Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet Rocheteau} flaunts lovers before her husband. (False.)<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Gunter Semmelweiss spends a lot of time in the pig-shed. (True: he’s a miser and hoards money in the pig-pen, although Mathilda does not know this.)<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>@Actor[0eQzvUSeBpJGqrhw]{Isolde Gudhoffen} got her gold brooch by ‘being nice’. (False.)</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Being a snob who thinks herself more sophisticated than her neighbours, Mathilda has no time for local legends, history, and the like. She knows nothing of old battles, bones, or such things.</p>\n<h3>Capturing a Skull</h3>\n<p>This is not an easy task. Not knowing where the skulls come from, the Characters will have to wait for a skull to come to them. Beating the undergrowth around @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} is unlikely to have any effect.</p>\n<p>Unknown to the Characters, most of the previous sightings were experiments, as @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} learned how to control the skulls: moving, hiding, watching, following, and attacking. The attack on Erietta marked the end of his experiments, and Gräber has sent skulls to take up positions north, west, and east of the village. These are in position by approximately 3:00 pm on the day the Characters arrive.</p>\n<p>When the Characters encounter a skull, the GM can determine the success or failure of any attempts to capture it. They are small, and their shape means that they are not easily grappled (–30 penalty to all attempts to do so) but they might be caught in a net or something similar. The Players should be encouraged to try various approaches, with the GM judging each on its merits. All is not lost if the Characters fail to capture a skull.</p>\n<h4>Captive Skulls</h4>\n<p>Any captive skulls cannot be interrogated, but may be useful nevertheless. The behaviour of a captured skull depends on its state. If active, the skull does whatever @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} tells it; if passive, it keeps on trying to carry out its last instructions. If the skull is in a dormant state, the Characters may make use of its orientation ability (say by using it as a compass or by putting it on a lead), or attempt to gain control of it and perhaps use it to follow other skulls. Of course, the villagers will not be too happy at the prospect of a magical skull flying around the village, no matter how tame the Characters say it is! See @JournalEntry[sM6ypxnSWfyR64sO]{The Flying Death Skulls} for more information on tracking, controlling, and dealing with the skulls.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[JvpRL5CrRTiuaXgX]{Wuder Lechart} approaches within five yards of a dormant skull, it senses his warpstone and tries to move towards it. If able to move, the skull flies slowly up to Wuder (who watches in fascination), and then snuggles up to him like a pet cat, getting as close to the warpstone as possible.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: THE CELLAR</em></h3>\n<p><em>Grognard Players may remember that in the original adventure, ‘Grapes of Wrath’, the villain is one Dieter Maranauer, whose twin brother Stefan had an affair with @Actor[cFiWNzAwDs4EXMUD]{Elisabet} and was bricked up in the cellar by a vengeful @Actor[v0envq9fHrdoIzUg]{Henri-Phillippe}. They may decide to search the burgomeister’s cellar looking for evidence of the crime, but in this version there is no Stefan, no Dieter, no affair, and no hidden body. Even if the Characters take the cellar completely apart, they find nothing.</em></p>\n<p><em>Strangers who start pillaging people’s homes — or appearing to do so — will not make a good impression on the villagers, to say nothing of the burgomeister and his wife. If the GM is feeling especially cruel and the party does not include any Dwarfs or anyone with Trade (Engineer), a too-thorough search of the cellar might result in structural damage to the Rocheteaus’ house, or even total collapse.</em></p>\n<p><em>However the Characters may try to excuse their actions, the people of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} conclude that here is another group of adventurers who, just like many they have heard of, are nothing more than brigands trying to put on an air of respectability.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">After being caught in the cellar, the Characters suffer a –20 penalty to all Fellowship-based Tests when talking to any of the villagers. Destroying the burgomeister’s house will probably get them run out of @JournalEntry[O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}, pursued by a mob of villagers brandishing torches and pitchforks.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"XPM9XriCft4SkXW7","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Flying Death Skulls","sort":500000}}}
{"_id":"xcdBouVomksZYYut","name":"The Altdorf Stage","content":"<p>Burdened as they are with a large and heavy crate and a delivery date that is approaching rapidly, the Characters must find a ride to Middenheim.

While this saves them coach fares, they may find it harder to obtain accommodation for the night in coaching inns along the way.

As part of its expansion, the house is acquiring coaching inns along all the major routes, for the exclusive use of its passengers. A coach departs for Middenheim daily year-round, leaving Altdorf at 10:00 am.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.HqarwMVLyiaal4sK]{Castle Rock Coaches} is based in Middenheim, and is fighting hard to keep its share of the capital’s route. It has made arrangements with many independent coaching inns along the way, and has blocked the efforts of Four Seasons to take control of several inns between Altdorf and Middenheim. Coaches leave for Middenheim every second day (Wellentag, Marktag, Bezahltag, and Angestag) at 7:00 am.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eis-journals.gCFx3Jzxj3h2EL49]{Ratchett Lines} is a smaller operation, based in Altdorf like Four Seasons, though it is older. Some nobles prefer Ratchett because of its history, and because their families have always travelled by that line. Under increasing pressure from Four Seasons, the line’s coaches seem old-fashioned and a little shabby, but its employees pride themselves on the quality of their service. </p>\n<p>Ratchett Lines is trying to position itself as an exclusive and upper-class carrier, charging 10% more than its competitors. Its coaches do not depart according to a regular schedule: those engaged by noble passengers leave as soon as possible, regardless of the hour, while others leave when all the seats are taken.</p>\n<h3>Fellow Travellers</h3>\n<p>While the Characters might be able to book a coach all to themselves, it might be more entertaining to give them some interesting travelling companions. The number of possible companions depends on the size of the party and the capacity of the coach: most coaches can seat a maximum of six passengers inside and another six on the roof.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.Pa77IT9maJR1nU7M]{Alex Eisen}</p>\n<p>No matter how much care the Characters might have taken to avoid him, the insufferable boatman can always make a reappearance: perhaps his intended coach was full; or he was ejected because of offending another passenger of higher status, or the other passengers included nonhumans, or those from foreign lands, or people from one of the many other groups that he dislikes.</p>\n<p><em>‘Well, hello there!’ </em>says a familiar voice as the Characters board the coach.<em> ‘And there I was worrying that the journey would be dull! A slight change of plans, as you see, but it all worked out for the best! I never finished telling you about those Elves, did I? They plan to take over the rivers as well as the ocean!’</em></p>\n<p>The Characters’ hearts sink to their boots. It is going to be a long, long journey — especially if Alex’s loud opinions lead to conflict at an inn along the way. If the Characters are seen to be travelling with him, they could be thrown out as well.</p>\n<h4>The Jung Sisters</h4>\n<p>Ulrike and Bertha Jung, the daughters of a prosperous Altdorfer wool merchant, are travelling to Middenheim to visit their cousin @Actor[431EWVoIAsdZFHPU]{Kirsten Jung}, a Lady at Court. They are accompanied by their bodyguard, Gunder.</p>\n<p>Both women are young (19 and 17 respectively) and clearly quite refined. If game stats are needed, they are both @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.2aKiMpKfVnXWNfmy]{Traders} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.0KNI4TzKqL2ZQfVl]{Clerks}, with Skills including Charm, Etiquette (Guilder), and Gossip, and Talents including @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.8lSoPDGrmeTIaapm]{Gregarious}, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write}, and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.LPgjE0cexTVOBVCY]{Suave}.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Flying Death Skulls</span></h3>\n<p><em>Some grognard players may recognise these two ladies and their bodyguard from the adventure ‘Grapes of Wrath’, which was first published in issue 98 of White Dwarf magazine (February 1988) and was reprinted in The Restless Dead (1989). If so, they will probably be expecting the coach to be attacked by flying undead skulls.</em></p>\n<p><em>In this book, that does not happen — but the skulls do make an appearance in the <strong>Power Behind the Throne Companion</strong>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gunder is a giant of a man, but not exactly bright. His brow is thick and sloping, and his massive jaw seems to jut further forward than his twisted and flattened nose. He is clad in a leather jerkin and armed with a huge axe. He is a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.9q1yLMpfhX1bqvth]{Guard} and former @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.careers.FgVH1pPS9oRq0o2Z]{Soldier}, with Talents including Menacing and Traits including @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.GbDyBCu8ZjDp6dkj]{Belligerent}and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.a8MC97PLzl10WocT]{Big}. His Intelligence is only 22, but given his strength and imposing nature he has never found this to be a problem.</p>\n<p>The young ladies are happy to engage in polite conversation on the journey, but woe betide any Character  who fails to show them proper respect. If the Characters have made a favourable impression on them by the time the coach reaches Middenheim, they may introduce them to their sister Kirsten. They are staying in guest-rooms in the outer palace during their stay in the city.</p>\n<h4>The Pilgrims</h4>\n<p>@JournalEntry[LsUklap1rbMtM7RO]{The Place of Shining Rock} is a shrine near Kutenholz that is sacred to followers of both Ulric and Sigmar. One or two pilgrims — devout followers of one god or the other, but not necessarily members of religious careers — board the coach at Altdorf and are let off near Kutenholz, where a side-road leads to the shrine. Such fellow travellers can be a good source of information about the religious situation — biased in favour of their own particular religion, of course. All this information can be found under ‘News and Rumours’ in this book and in <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>. This is a chance for you to feed the players any information that they might have missed.</p>\n<h4>The Mercenary</h4>\n<p>A military officer, recently retired from service, is heading for Middenheim, intending to enjoy the Carnival before enlisting with Baumann’s Blitztruppe, a famous ‘Free Company’ or mercenary unit that is mustering there before heading east on some undisclosed mission. While he knows nothing of the mission, he is able to fill the Characters in on the growing conflict between Ostland and Talabecland, which threatens to destabilise a significant part of the Empire. Like the pilgrims, this soldier can convey news and rumours that the Characters might have missed.</p>\n<h4>The Imperial Cartographer</h4>\n<p>A young man or woman, Bart or Bella Kurz, dressed in respectable but faded and slightly worn clothes boards the coach in Altdorf, after seeing several oddly shaped leather and wooden cases loaded on to the roof and secured with ropes. He or she is a cartographer working for the Imperial Survey Service, and has been sent to Middenheim to confer with members of the city’s cartographical service on the location of several settlements whose exact position is disputed.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have not yet heard the rumours of ducal cartographer Gulhein Tobwurst, who was recently fired over a number of egregious errors, Kurz will be happy to relate the tale in a gravely serious tone. It is said that Tobwurst’s maps show the town of Delberz in so many different places that emissaries have been sent from both Altdorf and Middenheim to search for it. Tobwurst is currently being held responsible for the tax revenue that has gone uncollected from the obscure settlement.</p>\n<h4>A Mission of Mercy</h4>\n<p>A Shallyan priestess or nun is travelling from Altdorf to take up a posting at the famed Great Hospice, a secluded hospital not far from Frederheim that treats disorders of the mind. More on the Great Hospice can be found in the companion volume to this adventure, <strong>The Power Behind the Throne Companion</strong>. If anyone aboard the coach is injured between Altdorf and Frederheim, she treats them; she gets off the coach at the small town, where a Shallyan nun meets her in a pony and trap.</p>","folder":"tp4QvOHx22sG8xK2","sort":275000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 1: The Road to Middenheim","sort":275000}}}
{"_id":"ybdS4Z0pbWL8oiND","name":"Emmanuelle Schlagen","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/emmanuelle-schlagen.webp\" width=\"213\" height=\"230\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}</p>\n<h3>Role</h3>\n<p>One of the Ladies at Court, she has also been the @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf ’s} paramour for 15 months. Moderate influence (2 votes).</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Lives in the Outer Palace, but attends many Carnival events. In public she is accompanied by at least one other Lady at Court, a major NPC, or a senior member of the City Guard. She likes wining, dining, and dancing at high-class hostelries, informal theatrical events, and occasional modest gambling.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Characters without the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette (Nobles or Servants)} Talent</strong>: –10 to Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Elves</strong>: +5 to Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Emmanuelle knows who has influence with the Graf. She also knows that he has been in a decline and increasingly follows the majority opinion. She is afraid of losing her position if she tries to influence political affairs, so she does not pry into matters of state, and does not know who is behind the taxes. She does know that now the tax changes have been enacted, a clear majority among the Graf ’s advisers will be needed to reverse them. She may reveal that the Graf told her that the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} was enthusiastic about the tax changes, while the @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Marshals} and @JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{wizards} argued against them.</p>\n<p>She may recommend @Actor[RhXJwUjrYOIqcTk4]{Petra Liebkosen} as a good source of court gossip. If the Characters are being sympathetic about the blackmail, she will suggest that they talk to Petra just generally, to see what she has heard. She suspects that someone with access to the Inner Palace must have stolen the letters, since there was no sign of a break-in.</p>\n<p>Emmanuelle may reveal that @Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} has made advances to her if this seems relevant: she has not told @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} of this. From his talk about about illict herbs, she suspects the ‘Doktor’ is the worst kind of <em>bon vivant</em>. If the Characters know (or suspect) about the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor’s} addiction, they may falsely suspect Luigi of being his supplier.</p>\n<p>Emmanuelle is important because of her influence on @Actor[czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf Boris}, and her knowledge of who else influences him. The Characters should work hard and carefully to win her trust.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>None. Through talking with Graf Boris she knows who influences him, and how much.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Normally an avid seeker of wealth and position, Emmanuelle is concerned only with getting her neck out of the blackmail noose. She has considered fleeing Middenheim, but feels some guilt about leaving @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} to face the music alone. However, she will overcome this scruple if nothing changes soon. If the Characters mention blackmail, she may panic and flee — unless Ar-Ulric has already warned her that they are investigating the matter. In that case, everything depends on her assessment of the Characters: if confident, she will give them her full cooperation; otherwise, she will gather her valuables and flee at the first opportunity.</p>\n<p>If Emmanuelle flees, Ar-Ulric may panic, Graf Boris may begin an investigation, and @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} will do all he can to find out who has been stirring things up and have them killed (see ‘@JournalEntry[jepWFu96Qh64OlHw]{Pawns of the Evil Wizard},’). The Characters may have to pursue her and bring her back by force — but only if the adventure is progressing exceptionally well and a few days’ delay will not guarantee failure. Otherwise, let her stay in Middenheim and be as helpful as the Characters’ diplomacy warrants. She will only use her influence to support the Characters if the blackmail letters are recovered, and if they clearly have other supporters in court circles.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} — Chancellor</strong>: Loathes his stiff formality and insults him with backhanded compliments.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmiedehammer} — Champion</strong>: Knows him only from Kirsten Jung’s comments and from infrequent meetings. Thinks him kindly, strong, and attractive, but dull.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} — Minstrel</strong>: Fast friends and platonic companions, even after their brief affair four years ago. She has not told him of her affair with Ar-Ulric, and thinks him too trusting to suspect; she knows how he idealises females.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} — the ‘Princess’:</strong> Resents her disdain for all the Ladies at Court. Has persuaded the Graf not to meet Katarina in her presence, to spare the ‘Princess’s’ feelings.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} — Chaperone</strong>: Returns Hildegarde’s open contempt with hatred, and would love the chance to cut her down.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: No strong feelings. Schutzmann is a former lover, although they do not meet now. Knows that Von Genscher’s son, Anton, is having a sporadic affair with Petra Liebkosen. Thinks that von Genscher is a fine figure of a man.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Indifferent; no dealings.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Given her appetites and the Graf ’s decline, Emmanuelle was always likely to take another. Ar-Ulric is attentive, wealthy, and — given his position — guaranteed to be discreet. Emmanuelle is genuinely fond of him, but feels superior: less gullible, and tougher.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: She thinks Kirsten Jung kindly and good-natured, but a little prim. She dislikes Natasha because of  her haughty and condescending demeanour. She is perhaps closest to Petra Liebkosen, since their personalities are broadly similar — but worried that the gossip-loving Petra may unintentionally have helped the blackmailer.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} — Knight Eternal</strong>: Avoids him, but insults him behind his back for his lack of worldly intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} — Master of the Hunt</strong>: A long-time friend, Allavandrel introduced Emmanuelle to a theatrical contact, which led to her first acting break. The Elf is an amusing and trustworthy companion, and although they have never had an affair, they did share an occasional night of passion before Emmanuelle landed the Graf.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} — Komission Convenor</strong>: Despises him: he tried to buy her favours before she became a Lady at Court. Will take any opportunity to spread rumours about his business dealings, and his personal pleasures.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} — Baronial Physician</strong>: Alarmed by some quite explicit advances he made to her, she avoids him. Luigi made references to certain treatments he knew of that can enhance masculine fervor marvellously, which left Emanuelle too shocked to reply.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: Has heard of them through Ar-Ulric, but does not know any of them personally. She thinks of them as capable men, who do their job well enough.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[kBuHrviVMTpFdPpu]{Sascha Rothbert} - The Fixer: </strong>Schlagen remembers Rothbert as someone who occasionally hung around with her old theatrical friends. She’s wary of spending time with anyone associated with that time in her life. While she enjoyed it, she’s moved on.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal}  </strong><strong>— The Chamberlain: </strong>Emmanuelle never liked Breugal, finding his manner off-putting while simultaneously hating herself for caring so much about what he might be thinking and searching for any signs that he is judging her. At first, she was afraid he knew about her involvement with the Graf; now, she worries that he might know about her affair with @Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric}. She avoids the chamberlain whenever she can.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[7meYhAhOFdwPuz6S]{Edel Mueller} - High Priestess: </strong>Schlagen dislikes the High Priestess’s attitude and has wondered whether she is behind the blackmail letters.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[0hUeYuOTIij6fMt4]{Isolde Begegnen} - High Matriarch: </strong>Considers her naive and distrusts anyone so apparently idealistic. She believes that Katarina confides important secrets to Isolde, which is not true but feels plausible.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Gymnasts}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Operatic Recitals}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Elven Lightsingers}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Backertag</strong>: @JournalEntry[59UTck37Z89GOAvk]{The Fire-Breathers of Carroburg}, @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Life-Sculpting}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Flying Displays}, <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{The Barbarian of Vessille}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Ice Dance Championships}, @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Giuseppe Pastrami’s Luccinian Liturgical Castrates Choir}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 Angestag</strong>: @JournalEntry[kFHdWHpLvmZ1D8HH]{Water Polo Tournament}, @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Illuminations of the Black Pool}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/actors/emmanuelle-schlagen.webp","folder":"So1PdVn4b7FXXZLo","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"NPC Summary Sheets","sort":0}}}

At the temple, she oversees care for the sick and nurturing the orphans. Like the other high priests, she is consulted in matters of city government, but outside her domain she has little interest in the running of Middenheim.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>The High Matriarch has a small annexe in the temple where she sleeps and lives in contemplation. Begegnen’s cell is small and austere. She rises early to pray and begin a long, arduous day ministering to the sick and those in need. Most of the time she stays in the temple, but she also makes excursions into the @JournalEntry[NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}, @JournalEntry[y4MpfiD6PHBOAdX0]{Southgate}, and other poor parts of the city.</p>\n<p>From time to time she visits the palace or @JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Physician’s Guild} to meet with those who seek her counsel or support.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p>The High Matriarch tries to see the best in others, whoever they are. Everyone starts with a +5 to Fellowship Tests, which is lost if they act or speak cruelly of other Humans, Elves, Dwarfs, or Halflings or dismiss their suffering. Brass Characters also get a permanent +5 to Fellowship Tests.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Begegnen does not have much insight into who can influence the Graf, but through her relationship with @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} she has realised that the ‘Princess’ is more influential than most would expect.</p>\n<h3>Misconceptions</h3>\n<p>Other than @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina}, she believes that only the @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor}, @JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{Law Lords}, @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}, and @JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{Midden Marshals} have any real influence on the Graf ’s decisions.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>The High Matriarch wants the tax to be repealed and will lobby to ensure this happens. She also seeks increased support for the Temple’s good works and improved sanitation in the poor parts of the city. She wants the @JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Physician’s Guild} to pay greater respects to Shallya and less to gold. Finally, she wants to know what made Ar-Ulric back the tax, as it seems to make no sense.</p>\n<h3>Influence</h3>\n<p>The High Matriarch has an active dislike of politics and dislikes those who deal in it. As such, she has no influence on the Graf.</p>\n<h3>Pressure Points</h3>\n<p>Begegnen founded the temple’s orphanage and school herself and she is very protective of the institution and its charges. If @Actor[lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} were to threaten either the children or the reputation of the temple, she would become reluctant to support anyone trying to bring down the tax or investigate the conspiracy in the city.</p>\n<h2>THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS</h2>\n<p>She may disdain politics, but Isolde Begegnen is well connected in Middenheim.</p>\n<h3>The Other NPCs</h3>\n<p>Begegnen has had dealings with many of the major NPCs.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} – Chancellor</strong>: The High Matriarch has faint disapproval for the Chancellor, complaining that he knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmeidehammer} – Champion</strong>: Schmeidehammer has been known to donate to the @JournalEntry[NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya}, so she holds him in some regard. She learned recently that he’d supported the taxes and was very surprised, more baffled than angry with him. It is very out of character and she wonders whether he has been bewitched.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Rallane Lafarel} – Minstrel</strong>: Although he brings joy to those around him, Begegnen finds Rallane too flippant.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina Todbringer} – ‘Princess’</strong>: The High Matriarch has a very favourable view of Katarina, as the ‘Princess’ is a patron of the Cult of Shallya. The two have become formal but cordial acquaintances and the High Matriarch has offered some guidance to Katarina. She has also discovered that Katarina is more perceptive and intelligent than first impressions suggest. If Begegnen trusts the party and they can convince her of their noble intentions, she may be able to arrange a meeting with Katarina.  </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZyMHHLG9tNTDIw8S]{Hildegarde Zimperlich} – Chaperone</strong>: They have a strained but respectful relationship — she believes that Zimperlich means well, but finds her snobbery and rigid morality difficult to tolerate.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peE10NZ6P1WUSrHj]{The Midden Marshals}</strong>: She has no real involvement with them.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[S8vPgJTGUhcf9PmF]{The Wizards}</strong>: Although the @JournalEntry[TphvT5oGb08QamJt]{Wizards Guild} has several supporters of the cult, the High Matriarch finds Helseher too detached from the real world. She understands that Eberhauer is a good person, but has had no dealings with her personally.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{High Priest Ar-Ulric}</strong>: Before the new taxes, the High Matriarch had a good relationship with Ar-Ulric and she appreciated his insight and wisdom in religious matters. Ulricans and Shallyans are often at odds elsewhere in the Empire, but in Middenheim relations were relatively harmonious. This changed with Ar-Ulric’s support for the taxes. She is furious at his betrayal and struggles to reconcile her forgiving faith with her anger. She’s petitioned him, but noticed that he seems distracted and conflicted. If the party discover and explain his situation, she feels deep sympathy and help them by arranging a meeting with Ar-Ulric. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{The Paramour} and the @JournalEntry[hZHFXGJxWPSY0kPo]{Ladies at Court}</strong>: She has no dealings with them, other than Kirsten who is a follower of Shallya. They are well-acquainted and the priestess supports her relationship with @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter}. In a recent conversation with Kirsten she was surprised to hear that he had supported the tax.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} – Knight Eternal</strong>: No real dealings with him. She is occasionally forced to deal with orphans who have mocked him in the street. </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Allavandrel Fanmaris} – Master of the Hunt</strong>: She believes that he’s a decent Elf, but sometimes gets the impression that Elves in the city look down on the Human pantheon.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein} – Komission Convenor</strong>: He donates to the orphanage anonymously, but Isolde discovered this and was quite surprised. She mentioned it to some of her subordinates and it’s becoming more widely-known… just as Wittgenstein planned.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[2gjtu5TLTG8YCJmh]{Luigi Pavarotti} – Baronial Physician</strong>: Pavarotti has not visited the temple, and Isolde is not impressed. As a physician, she would expect him to pay homage to the patron goddess of healing. She has petitioned the @JournalEntry[ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Middenheim Physicians Guild} to investigate whether he is a fraud.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PmdkMpdJ6LiidMRL]{The Law Lords}</strong>: She had a close relationship with Ehrlich, whose care for the poor made him a supporter of the cult. She’s worried that he seemed depressed last time he visited the temple. No dealings with the other two.</p>\n<h3>Carnival Events</h3>\n<p>Despite her piety, the High Matriarch attends the Carnival to enjoy the more genteel entertainments.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Wellentag</strong>: @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Matinee of Bards and Poets}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Aubentag</strong>: <em>@JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Opera The Barbarian of Seville}</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Marktag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Pageant of Mummers}; @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{the Garden Party}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 Bezahltag</strong>: @JournalEntry[Rt7V7X2YLSkCAWeG]{Druidic life sculptures}; @JournalEntry[2kurmvKWXMl5TfjR]{Elven lightsingers}</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 Konigstag</strong>: @JournalEntry[s3lHoQWAJ1gVpeIH]{Black Pool Illuminations}</p>","folder":"udGynnL2hxddlr6Q","sort":900000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Some Very Important People","sort":900000}}}
{"_id":"zm2zG5Tw0uj9H3ao","name":"The Powers That Be","content":"<p>This adventure requires the Characters to make the acquaintance of various figures in the upper echelons of Middenheim’s society, uncover the evil plot that has prompted the new taxes, and bring influence to bear on the Graf: both to repeal the taxes, and to deal with the plot’s architect.</p>\n<p>This chapter falls into three sections. The first part covers the information that the Characters can discover from various sources, which should lead them to conclude that they need to make the acquaintance of one or more major NPCs. The second part deals with meeting the major NPCs themselves, and beginning to unravel the evil plot. The third part presents a series of events and encounters that take place independently, regardless of where the Characters are in their investigations.</p>\n<h2>Encountering NPCS</h2>\n<p>Once the Characters have made some initial enquiries and realised that something strange is going on, you  can use one or more of these events to start the main part of the adventure. In most cases, the Characters cannot initiate these events, though they can react to them as they choose.</p>\n<p>The outcome of the first encounter with a particular NPC  sets the tone of any future interaction. The Characters must decide how best to approach each NPC, and there are a number of ways of doing so.</p>\n<p>The first is via official channels. Many of the NPCs have functions connected with the running of the City. Theoretically they should be accessible to anyone with a valid interest in their particular job. In practice, official channels may result in an appointment in 2–11 days’ time ([[/r 1d10+1]]), which is probably too late to achieve the party’s goals.</p>\n<p>The second method is to bump into the NPC in a social setting or at a Carnival event: at the opera, for example, or the Archery Tournament. This is both quicker and simpler, since it does not require an appointment or a cover story. Various GM aids (see <strong>Keeping Track</strong>, below) are provided which list the major NPCs’ movements  during Carnival week.</p>\n<p>The Characters can also meet some NPCs through sheer chance as they move around the city. (A few examples are given below.) Such chance encounters can help enliven an unproductive session of play, but they must be used sparingly, so the Players do not feel they can passively wait for the answers to come to them. Some NPCs, like the @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Graf ’s Champion}, are very easy to come across around the city, and do not need specially-designed ‘chance encounters.’</p>\n<p>The Locations section of an NPC Sheet tells where the NPC lives and how he or she can be encountered. The party must find this information out for themselves, but it should not be too difficult to do so: any Middenheimer ‘in the know’ able to tell the party — or at least, to make a shrewd guess — which NPCs will attend which events, and where they are likely to be found at other times. This is Middenheim’s celebrity gossip, after all.</p>\n<p>For example, Chancellor @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Josef Sparsam} is an ardent collector of antiques. An NPC merchant might boast of having him as a customer, which might give the party the chance to meet him as he looks over some item or other in a place off the beaten track. The following pages suggest various means by which the party can encounter each of the major NPCs.</p>\n<p>However, it is one thing to encounter an NPC, and quite another to engineer a meeting. For example, the @Actor[nzNgV71abEH1iNFo]{Court Minstrel}, @Actor[1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Graf ’s Champion}, @Actor[NBkPZBRIQwPXeLUq]{Master of the Hunt}, and the Ladies-at-Court are fairly easily encountered, but they are usually surrounded by an entourage of admirers, flunkeys, drinking companions, and friends — not to mention bodyguards whose job is to keep the riff-raff at bay.</p>\n<p>The exact composition of an entourage varies with the circumstances — the ‘Princess’ may be surrounded by the Town Guard on a walkabout, but her box at the Royal Opera House holds a much smaller group of close friends. Details must be improvised according to the encounter. The Standard NPC sheet covers minor NPCs of various sorts, which can be used as required.</p>\n<p>There is always the chance that the Characters might not recognise an NPC at the first encounter. For example, @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}, Chairman of the @JournalEntry[V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}, dresses much like any other merchant, and may not seem particularly important if casually encountered in a tavern. If the Characters have a precise description of an NPC’s appearance, of course, that’s another matter!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>KEEPING TRACK</em></h3>\n<p><em>When running this adventure, you (the GM) need to know where every one of the 22 major NPCs is at any time, and also which major NPCs, if any, are in the same location as the Player Characters. At the back of this book are 15 NPC sheets, 21 NPC cards, one master NPC card, and a master attractions chart.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE NPC SHEETS AND CARDS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Detailed information on each major NPC or group of NPCs is found on the NPC Summary Sheets. The NPC sheets include profiles and descriptions for each NPC and summarise each one’s role at court, what they know, who they know, and what they think of them. The NPC cards give each character’s schedule for Carnival week. An NPC will attend the listed events unless there is a very good reason not to do so. If an NPC is listed as participating at an event it may be impossible to convince them to break such a commitment.</em></p>\n<p><em>The listing only covers major Carnival events. Whenever the NPC is not listed as being anywhere in particular, you may pencil in some other location and/or activity. With a few exceptions, the NPCs may be willing to change some of their plans to help the Characters out — but only if they are convinced that it is essential. Remember to update the Master Attractions Calendar as well as the individual NPC card.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE AQUAINTANCES &amp; </em><em>MACHINATIONS OF THE </em><em>COURT OF MIDDENHEIM</em></h3>\n<p><em>This two page spread summarises each NPC’s role, both at the Court and in the adventure, including ‘influence votes’ with the Graf, and other important relationships. NPCs are grouped according to social or political allegiance where possible. This chart should never be seen by players, as even a glance can spoil the plot.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE MASTER </em><em>ATTRACTIONS CALENDAR</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Master Attractions Folder shows when and where each Carnival event occurts, and which NPCs will be in attendance. Each day consists of a section on parchment which shows the time and location of each event. This section may be freely shared with players, as this information is widely available and many Middenheimers will have it memorised. The section not printed on parchment is for GM use only, and shows which NPCs are in attendance. While Characters may learn of some NPCs plans with ease, such as Dieters attendance at Challenges to the Grafs Champion, the schedules of important court officials are not generally shared publically. </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Dropping By</h3>\n<p>At home, an NPC is  protected by guards and servants, such as butlers and valets, who try to ensure that no one sees their master or mistress without an appointment, or at least without good cause. Some may  refuse to help the Characters simply to emphasise their own rank and position. Faced with an unyielding lackey, the Characters have various options.</p>\n<h4>Bribery</h4>\n<p>These are elite servants, and bribery attempts are more likely to offend them than persuade them to admit the Characters: all <strong>Bribery </strong>Tests should be at least <strong>Difficult (–10)</strong> and potentially <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong> to reflect this.  The difficulty should reflect your estimation of the NPCs initial attitude toward the Characters. Failure is likely to result in physical ejection from the premises, or even a call for the Watch.</p>\n<p>The roll should also be adjusted according to what the Characters are asking. It difficult to see a major NPC at home without an invitation or appointment, but if the Characters only want to know whether the NPC will be attending a certain event — something that is already public knowledge, or close to it, and something which, if asked later, the NPC can deny — the chances are far better. Remember that, regardless of the roll, no NPC is likely to do anything too stupid or ridiclous, especially if it would put their own position at risk.</p>\n<h4>Bluff</h4>\n<p>A less risky way of getting past servants is to bluff. The servant does not automatically know whether someone is lying, and if the lie seems convincing enough, it becomes more than the servant’s job’s worth to turn the Character away. What if he really is the Padishah Emperor of all Araby?</p>\n<p>Of course, the Characters should do more than simply arrive and hope for a successful <strong>Charm </strong>Test. They should look and speak the part, perhaps having ‘servants’ of their own to announce them. The appropriate @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette} Talent (Servants, Nobility, or Guilder)  informs a Character how best to approach them.</p>\n<p>To see @Actor[htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor Sparsam}, for example, the party might use his interest in antiques by posing as merchants or fellow collectors. Once they are talking to the Chancellor, they can shift the conversation to the new tax laws — assuming, of course, that they do know something about antiques: bluffing Sparsam is far harder than bluffing his servants.</p>\n<h4>Gossip</h4>\n<p>Finally, the party might simply talk with a servant as an end in itself, especially in the early part of the adventure, when they are fishing for clues. While a successful Gossip Test might let a Character know how to approach this, make sure to let them roleplay the situation themselves, as this can be far more entertaining.</p>\n<p>For example, the Chancellor’s butler could be approached in the following manner: <em>‘Excuse me, but your master appeared a little unwell. Perhaps I’m wrong, but I wondered — probably foolishly — whether some help might not be solicited. I myself know a little about medical matters.’ </em>Faced with such concern and politeness, the butler probably won’t take offence — although whether he agrees with the Character is something else. Having buttered up the butler in this way, the Character might come back in a day or two to enquire further about the Chancellor’s health, and perhaps the butler might mention the visits of a certain lady...</p>\n<h3>Good Manners</h3>\n<p>The main reason for the Characters to seek out the major NPCs is to learn as much as they can about the tax changes, but in court circles one does not simply collar people and demand to know if they used their influence on the Graf for one thing or another.</p>\n<p>If the players do not realise this for themselves, a helpful NPC can tell them that one must be polite and tactful about such matters. Although a number of the NPCs are anxious about their positions, they won’t take rudeness or violence from total strangers lightly. The Watch is more than happy to oblige these prominent citizens by making inconvenient out-of-towners go away.</p>\n<h3>The Carnival</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[YPpM7Pg44EgT2yt5]{The Carnival} offers plentiful opportunities for the Characters to encounter members of the city’s elite, and if things are not going their way, then chance – or rather, you – can put other opportunities in their way. There are many ways to achieve this of course, and you should let the players find their own way, responding to the Characters’ actions as appropriate: still, the following notes may prove useful if the Players find themselves at a loss.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-pbtt/assets/images/sparsam-flees.webp","folder":"IOqzzXGRK0YmZ3sY","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"nEodC92V8JiQPG6I":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-pbtt":{"initialization-folder":"Chapter 6: The Powers That Be","sort":100000}}}
