They are as loyal as any Skaven, with vague memories of tunnels, betrayal, and the dark of the Under-Empire replacing those of their old life.

It is unclear whether this lore remains similar to how it is practised in Cathay, or if the Sorcerers of Clan Eshin have corrupted a more noble form of stealthy magic. Regardless, spells of this lore specialise in concealing the sorcerer from prying eyes, using magic to distract or diminish signs of the Skaven&rsquo;s presence.</p><p>The Lore of Stealth wreathes the wielder in threads of magic that obfuscate their presence. Whenever you successfully cast a spell from the Lore of Stealth, you gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.OzwDT6kzoLYeeR2d]{Stealthy} Creature Trait for [[/br 1d10]] rounds.</p><p>Ingredients: Clan Eshin Sorcerers use small scraps of paper with assorted runes inscribed on them, which are then coated in powdered Warpstone. When used as an ingredient, the Warpstone powder is consumed, but the scraps of paper remain and can be coated again and reused. The characters used are of no known form of written Queekish, and the Sorcerers of Clan Eshin are in no rush to explain either their meaning or providence.</p><p>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"lore":{"type":"String","label":"Lore","value":"stealth","effect":""},"range":{"type":"String","label":"Range","value":"You"},"target":{"type":"String","label":"Target","value":"Special","aoe":false},"duration":{"type":"String","label":"Duration","value":"2 × Willpower Bonus rounds","extendable":true},"damage":{"type":"String","label":"Damage","dice":"","value":""},"cn":{"type":"Number","label":"Casting Number","value":8,"SL":0},"magicMissile":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Magic Missile","value":false},"memorized":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Memorized","value":false},"skill":{"value":""},"ingredients":[],"currentIng":{"type":"Number","label":"Ingredient","value":""},"wind":{"value":""},"overcast":{"enabled":false,"label":"","valuePerOvercast":{"type":"","value":1,"SL":false,"characteristic":"","bonus":false},"initial":{"type":"","value":1,"SL":false,"characteristic":"","bonus":false}}},"effects":[{"_id":"FuWPWlicR3eYSuMl","changes":[],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null},"icon":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/icons/stealth.png","label":"Lore of Stealth","transfer":true,"flags":{"wfrp4e":{"effectApplication":"apply","effectTrigger":"prefillDialog","lore":true,"script":"\n                        if (args.type == \"skill\" &&  args.item.name.includes(\"Stealth\"))\n                        {\n                        let sl = this.actor.characteristics.ag.bonus\n                        args.prefillModifiers.slBonus += sl;\n                        }\n                        "}}}],"folder":"bzhAqbsy4fjlWm1P","sort":-150000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Stealth","sort":-150000}}}

The target creature, and any others within a number of yards equal to your Willpower Bonus, must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test or be transformed into Skaven of size appropriate to the original victim, nominally under your command. Most become @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.F1vAZZcmVKkRw8xn]{Clanrats} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.kl4qHg0mqWOApBqH]{Stormvermin}, but Ogres typically become @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.VfJgGmCTWqb0IDSW]{Rat Ogres}. They are as loyal as any Skaven, with vague memories of tunnels, betrayal, and the dark of the Under-Empire replacing those of their old life. Their nature is like that of any Skaven, and victims are unlikely to follow commands that would result in their death unless failing to follow those commands appears likely to be just as fatal.</p>\n<p>The forms of most humanoids were never intended to become as the Skaven, who despite being known colloquially as ratmen are far more rat than man. In most cases the spell&rsquo;s victims will revert to their true forms after the spell has ended, though all will bear some mark of what was done to them. This often takes the form of a patch of fur, a malformed tail or yellowed, pointed teeth.
