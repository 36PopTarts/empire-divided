Not a word of this must leave this room.’ He pauses, then continues, ‘The “Helm of the Ratslayer,” also known as “Mandred’s Crown,” has been stolen from its chapel in the Middenpalaz. It is the helm Emperor Mandred made from the skull of the Rat King in the Great War for Liberation nearly 1,500 years ago. It is a powerful relic; the Graf displays it once a year as a symbol of Middenheim’s invincibility. We fear this may be part of a larger plot against the city, itself. The documents you recovered from both Jarmund and Bhar suggest an alliance between the Purple Hand and — by the Heldenhammer I still struggle to believe this — the Skaven.’</p>\n<p>‘ You can understand our concern; confirmation of the existence of Skaven could lead to riots, especially if they are behind the theft.’ He hands them a document. ‘This is a list of recent thefts in the city reported to the Watch. We think the theft of Mandred’s Crown was the culmination of a series, but we need to know who and why. Start at the Middenpalaz, then follow the trail wherever it leads. Be discreet, but dogged. A word of caution: besides us in this room, only the Graf, the Midden Marshalls, and the Knights Panther who were there know of the Helm’s theft. It must remain that way.’ He pauses, ‘A carriage awaits you outside. Good luck.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/handouts/handout11.webp\" width=\"373\" height=\"311\" /></div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[1tTtz5r8kRRhzdZu]{Handout 11}</div>\n<h2>Investigation</h2>\n<p>After the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.16KsfNTgXYLtRib9]{Middenpalaz}, Characters can proceed through the list in any order. The clues suggest the presence of a priest-thief aligned with Ranald.</p>\n<h3>The Middenpalaz</h3>\n<p>The carriage takes the Characters to a side door where a Knights Panther sergeant whisks them down a little-used stairway to an ancient basement level. Passing through locked and guarded doors, they come to a door set in an ornately decorated doorway, the carvings showing men fighting rat-like beastmen. There they meet Franz, the guard on duty that night. The sergeant orders him to tell his story.</p>\n<p>Franz says that everything was quiet. Following procedure he and the prior guard verified the Helm was secure, then locked the door.<em> ‘It was the oddest thing. Soon after, I heard a clatter, then the sounds of rolling dice, but none of us would gamble on duty, Ulric’s word! When I went into the chapel to check… it was gone!’</em></p>\n<p>(The sounds were @Actor[0jsJ08ZpTqhFgGsO]{Bors} knocking a candelabra over, grabbing the Helm, then quickly casting @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.fABd17NZvg2uUReL]{‘You Ain’t Seen Me, Right?’} He then hid until the guard ran out, leaving via the secret door.)</p>\n<p>The chapel itself is a shrine to Ulric housing weapons, armour, and banners from the time of Mandred. An empty stand shows where the Helm rested. The secret door is undetectable from this side, and no one in the Palace these days is aware of it. </p>\n<p>Bors could not resist leaving a small calling card of a silver schilling with an X scratched onto the head. This can be spotted with a <strong>Hard (-20) Perception</strong> Test.</p>\n<h3>Dr Kopernik’s</h3>\n<p>Dr Isidore Kopernik, Tutor in Astronomy and Mathematics at the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, has chambers in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.hDeFkdQZ2g2fT0it]{Freiburg} district, where he hosts seminars for his students and does most of his research. An elderly eccentric, he is also a renowned collector of antique nosepicks. When the characters arrive, he is much more excited to talk about those than his stolen notes. <em>‘Ah, they were thoughts and formulae for predicting the movement of Morrslieb for a book I’m writing. I was close to a breakthrough! I can recreate the work eventually, but I thought I should report it. But can you believe the thieves left this set of gold-plated 15th century nosepicks untouched?’</em></p>\n<p>(One of the professor’s students is a cultist in the Yellow Fang, who passed on the information to the cult, who then alerted Bors.)</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>PICKING UP A TAIL</em></h3>\n<p><em>Within hours of their visit, Dr Kopernik lets slip during a seminar that the Watch had come by asking about the stolen papers. Among his students is the Yellow Fang cultist, who warns the cult. Two members then stalk the Characters, in case they get too close. When they find Bors, they attempt to kill the Characters and the Priest. (See @JournalEntry[DiPJtviV6aBaUNmH]{To Catch A Thief}) They can be spotted on a successful opposed <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception </strong>Test against the cultists’ </em>Stealth (Urban)<em> score of 55. If the cultists are captured or killed, the attack at the tavern does not occur.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Collegium Theologica Library</h3>\n<p>Agnise Fuensterburg was the duty library that night. Still outraged, she takes the Characters into the musty bookstacks. Each book had been chained to its shelf and secured with a lock, each of which has been clearly picked. <em>‘I was at my desk that night when a man came up and asked the way to the stacks. He was blond, had a trim beard, and his accent sounded Marienburger to me. I’d never seen him before, but he had a pass. After a few minutes, I heard a mocking laugh from the stacks. I went to look, but he was gone, and so were the books!’</em></p>\n<p>She can provide a list of the stolen books.</p>\n<p><em>White Wolf ’s Range</em>: A Geography of the Middle Mountains by Hieronymous Wundefuesse, 2114 IC</p>\n<p><em>Taking the Shot</em>: Everything You always Wanted to Know About Ballistics But Were Afraid to Ask, by Benevento Cannonero, on the mathematics of ballistics from 2401 IC</p>\n<p>Another Tilean book, <em>Walk Home Syndrome: Escaping on Foot,</em> Alfano Lo Sfortunato Tucci’s memoir  written in 1356 IC. Tucci claimed he had been prisoner for ten years in a city of man-like rats beneath Nuln.</p>\n<p>(The laughter she heard was a side effect of the miracle Bors cast to open a stubborn lock, ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.1MUSq1xRyHCaIuAL]{An Invitation}.’)</p>\n<h3>Lore House</h3>\n<p>The Lore House is the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.Pyw1rj2nIy1hm3MT]{Temple of Ulric’s} private library, where works of interest are kept for the benefit of priests and generous donors. Brother Schlager shows the Characters where the book was kept in a locked cabinet. On a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test, the Character notices faint, relatively fresh scratch marks around the lock — signs that it had been picked recently. Asked if he saw anything, Schlager shakes his head,<em> ‘No. I came that morning and it was gone. We don’t lock up at night. I mean, who is crazy enough to rob Ulric’s temple?’</em> The title of the work was, <em>The Middle Mountains Campaign: a History of the Glorious Assaults on Brass Keep in the War Against Chaos, with Some Assistance </em>by Magnus of Nuln<em>.</em></p>\n<h3>Art Theft</h3>\n<p>The @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.QYipS3tpaNBDgKsN]{Geldmund} home of Otmar Zufall, a prosperous and pretentious textile merchant, is known for its extensive and expensive art collection dealing with Middenheim’s history. Taken to Zufall’s study, they find the master of the house staring forlornly at an empty space on his wall. <em>‘It’s about time you’re here. I have connections at court, you know!’ </em>He points to where the painting was<em>.‘“Mandred Rampant Upon the Howling Hills,” by Gerlach Wendler, a contemporary of the Emperor. Magnificent work. The detailing on the rat-beastmen Mandred was slaying is so good, they almost seem real. That evening, I found a cat wandering the house as if he owned it. No, not mine. I hate the things. Servants must have left the door open — and I bet that’s how the thief got in! When I came down the next morning, it was gone.’ </em>Questioning the staff elicits nothing else besides denials that any of them has a cat or would ever leave a door open.</p>\n<p>(The cat was summoned through the miracle ‘@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.prayers.Bo3ukcaipFNb7Ljl]{Cat’s Eyes},’ which Bors used to case the joint.)</p>\n<h3>Royal College of Music</h3>\n<p>Located in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.jGfyLhox6OTD75oi]{Nordtor}, the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.VEXF5LRLCKQUo4jy]{Royal College of Music} is full of life as carpenters build sets, performers rehearse, and a man in the orchestra pit screams at a musician for getting a note wrong. This is Amadeus Tonkunst, Musical Director. Questioned about the theft, he explodes:<em> ‘I’m ruined! This was the only copy of an 18th century Tilean comic opera by Giuseppe di Burrataverde,</em> The Moon, The Cheese, And The Rat, <em>about a rat that tries to eat Morrslieb. Brilliant work! He was quite mad, claiming his work was prophecy, but the opera is a delight.  To my horror, yesterday morning, it was stolen from a locked desk drawer in my office. I have the only key! The performance has already been advertised and tickets sold! Ruined, I say!’</em></p>\n<p>Examining his office, a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test reveals recent scratch marks are found on the lock, just as at the Lore House.</p>","folder":"uhfMltV0348qnt4s","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Mysterious Thefts","sort":100000}}}

As the GM you should familiarise yourself with the whole adventure before deciding which sections to present to the Players in which order.

Not only does this provide them with the proper context For concerning themselves with the destruction of the Purple Hand, unmasking of Gotthard von Wittgenstein, and dissemination of evidence proving the existence of the Skaven, but it also gives a great reason for the authorities in Middenheim to pay them significant regard. After the events of Power Behind the Throne several important figures in Middenheim have reason to be grateful, and the Characters have been offered a generous stipend to help Watch Commander Ulrich Schutzmann search out associates of Wasmeier. The Horned Rat begins with a meeting with Schutzmann in which he outlines a new threat to the city, and provides some promising leads.</p>\n<h3>Starting from Scratch</h3>\n<p>The Horned Rat assumes Characters are quite experienced from adventuring through the previous Enemy Within books.

Tales from more than a thousand years ago tell of the Skaven Wars, in which rats and ratmen boiled up from the drains and sewers to attack the Empire’s cities following the Black Plague of 1111. The heroic Count Mandred of Middenheim united the reeling nation and led an army that defeated the evil ratmen. He defeated their leader in single combat, cutting off the monster’s head and turning its skull into a helmet that remains one of Middenheim’s greatest treasures. Mandred became Emperor of a grateful nation, and the ratmen were seen no more.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/seeing-grey.webp\" /></div>\n<h2>THE SKAVEN TODAY</h2>\n<p>Today, many in the Empire believe that the Skaven never existed. The ancient chroniclers, they say, turned the rats that spread the plague into intelligent, humanoid monsters, either as a symbol of the terror and devastation that it caused, or through a simple inability to credit that so many people — three-quarters of the Empire’s population, according to some records — could be killed by a creature so small, and so commonplace, as a rat. Others believe that the legends were true, but maintain that Count Mandred’s campaign wiped out the entire Skaven race. Others still believe them to be no more than Beastmen who happen to have been born resembling rats rather than goats or other creatures.</p>\n<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. The Skaven are all too real, and far from extinct. They have spent centuries in their underground lairs, breeding and plotting, and developing horrific technologies based on Warpstone, an unnatural mineral imbued with the very essence of Chaos. They learned a bitter lesson in the long-ago Skaven Wars, though, and rarely show themselves on the surface.</p>\n<h2>HISTORY</h2>\n<p>The origins of the Skaven are lost in the mists of time. A Tilean folk tale, <em>The Doom of Kavzar</em>, tells of an ancient city of Humans and Dwarfs brought low by a grey-clad stranger, who offered to complete an ambitious temple on condition he be allowed to add a dedication to his own gods. The temple was completed with miraculous speed, but the stranger disappeared, leaving a great horned bell in the temple’s tower that tolled thirteen times each night. On the first night, Morrslieb flashed as though in response to the sound; the next morning, black clouds darkened the sky and an ashy, oily rain began to fall.</p>\n<p>The storm worsened in the following days, with violent winds and black hail that ruined the crops for miles around. The hail grew in size, and soon great stones were falling on the city like missiles from a besieging army. The Humans’ homes were ruined, and the Dwarfs, safe underground at first, found the filthy water flooding their underground workings. Sickness and unnatural births spread throughout the town. Rats devoured whatever food was left. When that was gone, the rats roamed the streets in huge swarms, eating any creature they encountered.</p>\n<p>In desperation, the Humans invaded the Dwarfs’ underground homes, to find nothing more than gnawed bones and scraps of cloth. Multiple beady eyes glittered around them in the dark, and they gathered into a fearful huddle as their doom approached, and the sound of chittering increased and reverberated around the tunnels.</p>\n<p>In the heart of the Blighted Marshes that stretch from the north of Tilea to the Black Mountains lies the doomed city of Skavenblight — or so it is said. Whether or not it was once the Kavzar of the folk tale, the capital of the Skaven Under-Empire is a vast and unfathomable maze, from its crooked and dizzying spires to its bottomless depths. Countless Skaven live, breed, work, and die here, along with slaves taken from every known race. Tunnels radiate out from this great city in all directions, encircling the world.</p>\n<p>The Skaven spread out from the city in the very distant past, fighting wars against the other races, making and breaking treaties — and most of all, creating their own nests of intrigue. Civil war broke out from time to time, the last ending two centuries ago when the Grey Seers brought the lesser Skaven to heel by the unprecedented step of summoning the Horned Rat — the dark and dreaded god of the Skaven race. Since that time the Skaven clans have largely refrained from making open war upon each other, and the Grey Seers have kept a tight hold on power.</p>\n<p>Whether or not any of this is true is hotly debated among those few scholars who care to consider such things. Not one of these scholars can be found among the Skaven themselves, for they are a people who care little for history, even their own, and less for cerebral debate. As a ‘society’ they are far more concerned with the immediate present than any mythic past. As individuals, Skaven revise their own personal history constantly. Every mistake is the vile treachery of an underling, and every success a singular moment of victory achieved — despite the staggering incompetence of everyone else involved. The history of their species is a matter for others to consider — just prior to Skaven jaws snapping shut about their neck.</p>\n<p>However, there is a dark rumour of an abominable city of Skaven somewhere near Tilea — a towering monstrosity looming over a blighted marsh. If this was once the Human city of Kavzar none can say, for the Skaven claimed it long ago and there is nothing Human about it any more.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-skaven-banner.webp\" width=\"219\" height=\"307\" /></div>\n<h3>The Skaven Wars</h3>\n<p>More than 1,400 years ago, the Empire was struck by the Black Plague. This terrible disease carried off more than three-quarters of the population, wiping out generations, leaving whole towns deserted and corpses festering everywhere. The plague even carried off Boris Goldgather, who was arguably the least popular Emperor in history.</p>\n<p>Just as the Empire was most vulnerable, hordes of Skaven scurried from hidden underground tunnels, overrunning the land in the wake of the atrocious plague that they had unleashed upon the Old World. Thousands were slaughtered or enslaved, but those who remained fought back with incredible resilience and vigour. Count Mandred von Zelt of Middenheim rallied the surviving Elector Counts and fought a bloody campaign against the ratmen, culminating in 1124 in the Battle of the Howling Hills. There, Mandred beheaded the Skaven leader, Warlord Vrrmik of Clan Mors, with one stroke of the Middenland Runefang. The surviving Skaven broke and fled. After the battle Count Mandred had the Skaven Warlord’s skull fashioned into a helmet: known as the Helm of Skavenslayer. Mandred was dubbed ‘Skavenslayer’ and subsequently elected Emperor.</p>\n<p>Under Mandred’s leadership, the Empire slowly recovered from the Skaven wars. His heroic reputation and charismatic personality held the Empire together, and under his wise but stern rule a massive programme of reconstruction began. The Skaven have long memories, though, and on the cursed and haunted night of Geheimnisnacht Eve in 1152, Emperor Mandred died at the hands of a Clan Eshin assassin.</p>\n<p>The next Electoral Council ended in stalemate, with the Electors of Talabecland and Stirland mustering equal support. The result was a series of civil wars that lasted for the next two centuries, with no recognised Emperor.</p>\n<h3>The Red Pox</h3>\n<p>In 1786 the Red Pox broke out in the Bretonnian town of Bordeleaux. It spread rapidly, engulfing much of Bretonnia and northern Tilea. This was no natural plague, but was spread by the Skaven, again in the hope of softening up their opponents before moving in for the kill. Skaven armies emerged in the wake of the pox, expecting to find Bretonnia and Tilea weaker targets than the Empire. However, the people of both countries put up a desperate defence, and the Skaven force was broken at the Battle of Remarche in 1813 by a combination of Bretonnian and Wood Elf forces.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/itching-pox.webp\" width=\"316\" height=\"316\" /></div>\n<h3>The Great Summoning</h3>\n<p>The failure of this campaign led to another series of civil wars among the Skaven. They were only brought to an end in 2302, when the Grey Seers ordered all the feuding Skaven clans to Skavenblight and summoned the Horned Rat. This daring ritual terrified the clans into accepting the Grey Seers’ authority, at least in principle. In practice, feuds and intrigues continue unabated — these machinations are as natural to the Skaven as breathing — but despite this, the Skaven have once again begun to scheme and plot, and present a threat to the surface-dwellers.</p>\n<p>In the years that followed the Great Summoning, a number of attacks were made on the Tilean city-states. Many small towns bordering on the Blighted Marshes were razed or simply disappeared. Skaven raiders menaced shipping in the Tilean Sea until the Dwarfs of Barak-Varr destroyed a Skaven fleet in 2321.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-horned-rat2.webp\" width=\"192\" height=\"199\" /></div>\n<h3>The Battle Of Nuln</h3>\n<p>In 2499, after long years of building up strength beneath the cities of the Empire, the Skaven mounted a full-scale attack once again.</p>\n<p>It had long ago been discovered that Man-things could be bribed or blackmailed into aiding the Skaven: a campaign of manipulation and bribery targeted many key individuals, the most important of whom was Fritz von Halstadt, the Chief Magistrate of Nuln. When the Skaven’s plan to spark another civil war in the Empire was thwarted by a couple of sewer jacks, the enraged Grey Seer Thanquol mounted a vengeance-attack on the city. Troops from the four Greater Clans (Eshin, Moulder, Pestilens, and Skryre) and several Warlord Clans poured out of the sewers: close to half the city was destroyed, and a force of Stormvermin almost captured the Elector Countess @Compendium[wfrp4e-rnhd.rnhd-actors.CcqiAghkzgp9u1In]{Emmanuelle von Liebwitz}.</p>\n<p>Most members of the Council of Thirteen were furious, feeling that the attack was launched prematurely. Many more were upset with the attack’s failure. However, the Seerlord Kritislik pointed out that a rebellious Warlord Clan was all but eradicated during the action, which, he maintained, was to the benefit of the Council and all Skaven.</p>\n<p>The attack also showed that the Skaven’s long-cultivated veil of secrecy was effective. Despite many casualties, the majority of Nuln’s population still did not believe that Skaven existed. Even survivors from the thick of the fighting were persuaded that their foes were mutants or Beastmen. The Skaven ensured they remained a shadowy threat to all but the keenest of minds.</p>\n<h3>The Present Day</h3>\n<p>Nuln was rebuilt, and despite rumours of ruthless ratmen attacking the Elves of Ulthuan, no major Skaven action has been recorded in the Empire since. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/rat-catchers.webp\" width=\"309\" height=\"421\" /></div>\n<p>The Skaven have become much more secretive about their activities on the surface since Nuln. They act on a smaller scale, at night and under cover, and take care to kill any witnesses and remove their own casualties. From time to time, groups of Gutter Runners or lone Assassins are sent to recover or destroy evidence of the Skaven’s existence.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, members of Skaven cults like the @JournalEntry[jOtzoEfZ7JaOW7uK]{Yellow Fang} have standing orders to promote the fiction that the Skaven Wars never happened. According to a number of Skaven-sponsored historians, the ratmen are no more than a metaphor: an image created by the garbled, mythologised folk-memory of a time when the Empire was overrun by an exploding population of rats — completely normal rats, unremarkable except for their numbers — that spread the Black Plague.</p>\n<p>Because of this, the majority of the Empire’s inhabitants now believe that the Skaven either never existed or were wiped out in the long-ago Skaven Wars. The attack on Nuln is generally ascribed to Beastmen, and although a few scholars advance controversial theories about Skaven survival, and occasional sightings are reported in the Empire’s sewers or shadowed streets, almost no one takes such claims seriously.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/seeing-grey.webp","folder":"4D0HQOOQGBbb6EN3","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"History of the Skaven","sort":100000}}}
{"_id":"12lvOI4wQSBD4Lvx","name":"Brass Keep","content":"<h3>HISTORY OF BRASS KEEP </h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘If it were not that this place saw one of Sigmar’s great victories over the Dark, I would swear that it is accursed. The halls and bastions twist minds so that they become afraid of their own shadows. For sure, when the enemy is outside the walls, the soldiers of the Empire fight with valour. It is the enemy within that troubles me.’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Castellan Klaus von Wallenstein, Lord of Brass Keep 1628–1632 IC</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nobody knows who built the original Brass Keep. In centuries past, when scholars explored the castle, they speculated that it had been there long before Sigmar defeated the necromancer Morath. The Elves and Dwarfs have not been able to shed light on its origins either. The architecture has the elegance of Asur construction, but no High Elf can find details of its origins in their own history. Dwarf stonemasons recognise the expert masonry, but no Dwarfen hand is known to have fashioned Brass Keep’s cyclopean blocks.</p>\n<h3>Fastness of the Necromancer</h3>\n<p>Morath was the first known inhabitant of Brass Keep, a necromancer who fled the fallen kingdom of Strygos when his vampire liege Ushoran was overthrown. When the capital city Mourkain fell, Morath was entrusted with the Crown of Sorcery, a powerful and deadly artefact that had belonged to Nagash himself. </p>\n<p>Morath escaped west and north with a small retinue of wights. He sought a fastness within reach of Human tribes to enslave, from where he could rebuild the glory of Mourkain.  Morath took the ruined keep, raised its central tower, and cast powerful sorceries to shroud the ruin in illusions of grandeur that echoed his old home. For several centuries he conquered then killed the Humans around Brass Keep’s hinterland, reviving their corpses after death to toil on his behalf. The bodies were left to rot in the glacial lake when their labour was not needed.</p>\n<p>Eventually, whispers from the Crown of Sorcery told Morath that he must rouse himself for a greater purpose. Morath renewed his campaign of terror on the tribesfolk, who now built greater settlements of their own. The people of the Fauschlag sent expeditions into the mountains to find the source of the curse, but none returned.</p>\n<p>It was the coming of Sigmar that ended Morath’s terror. The Empire’s founder had a vision of Brass Keep and its blasphemous lord. He felt driven to march an army of six hundred Teutogens and Unberogens into the mountains to attack Morath. After a hard, freezing march they arrived in the glacial valley before Brass Keep, where they were astounded by the drowned city below the frozen lake. Morath stood atop the pearlescent bone tower and summoned his undead army from beneath the ice. Sigmar’s army was embattled, but Sigmar eventually fought his way up the tower to confront Morath. The Emperor defeated the necromancer and took the Crown of Sorcery. </p>\n<p>As Morath died, the drowned city, impressive turrets, and bastion were revealed as illusions, with only Morath’s tower intact. Sigmar marched east and abandoned the keep, leaving it a haunted, cursed place his followers were glad to leave.</p>\n<h3>A Holy Place</h3>\n<p>Brass Keep was soon reoccupied by a ragged group of Norscan stragglers left behind after Sigmar’s successful campaign against the incursion of Cormac Bloodaxe, champion of Khorne. These savage remnants of a once-great host squatted in the ruined fortress and eked out a life by hunting and fishing the lake. Their fate is unknown, but they were gone by the coming of Ulgrim’s Crusade in 450 IC.</p>\n<p>Arch Lector Ulgrim held the zealous belief that wherever Sigmar fought his enemies, the cult must establish a grand temple and expel any who were unholy. He launched a crusade to Brass Keep from Altdorf, marching through Middenland with a ragged host of flagellants and holy warriors. After suffering hardships in the mountains and causing no small amount of collateral damage to friendly villages and farms, Ulgrim stalked into the ruined Brass Keep and declared it holy ground.</p>\n<p>Brass Keep was held by a combined garrison of Middenland troops and Sigmarite pilgrims for hundreds of years. The walls were repaired and made fit for Human habitation, and a temple of Sigmar was established in the bastion wall. Life in the keep was hard — provisions were scarce in the mountains and the cold halls had few comforts. Worse, the inhabitants felt a sinister presence haunting both the fortress and the glacial valley. Desertion was common and even the most fanatical Sigmarite feared Morath still stalked the ruins.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries, Brass Keep changed hands several times. During the Age of Three Emperors, it was held by Ostland troops for a period and sacked several times by Orc tribes. In 1882 another crusade sought to recapture the keep from occupying Greenskins. Count Mordrek, son of the Reikland Emperor, led a disciplined army of Sigmarite Middenlanders to retake the fortress. His dominion over Brass Keep was troubled, and somehow the influence of the mountains or the cursed halls drove Mordrek to embrace the Ruinous Powers. He became the legendary ‘Count Mordrek the Damned’, a champion of Chaos doomed to an immortality where he could not die nor ascend to daemonhood.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">You can’t make me go back! I’ll hang </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">first. It’s in the soil, the food, the air. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">The streams run past the Keep, and </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">the filth flows down with it. Not even </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">should blessed Shallya herself descend </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">and cleanse the lands with Lord Ulric </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">at her side, not even then would I </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">venture back into that valley. I have </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">seen what dwells within that Keep. </p>\n<p><em>— Sargent Berget Haüler, hanged for desertion 2508 IC</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Blightkings Come</h3>\n<p>During the incursions of Chaos, Undra Kul’s warhost swept down from the coast, part of Asavar Kul’s monstrous invasion. The army swept into the Middle Mountains and besieged Brass Keep, where they hoped to establish a foothold in the Empire. After the Middenland defenders decimated the Chaos Warriors, a warband known as the Repugnauts invoked their god Nurgle, who infected the very stones of the castle; Chaos took Brass Keep once again. But this was a weakened army, and Nurgle’s plagues do not distinguish between victims. Soon the only survivors were the warriors of Nurgle themselves, who held out in hope that another Chaos horde would come to their relief.</p>\n<p>Respite came in the form of daemonic flies, which swarmed onto the survivors and infested the remaining defenders of Brass Keep. They were soon blessed by Nurgle to become first of the @Actor[MWUYvCCpNwg6eosZ]{Blightkings}, almighty champions of Nurgle, each with the power of a small army in their own right. Over the years, the castle attracted other Chaos cultists from the Empire, who flocked to the Blightking’s banner.</p>\n<p>The Empire has never retaken Brass Keep since. An attempt in 2370 IC was doomed to failure when the Blightkings and their vassals proved their supernatural resilience. A pair of great Chimera swooped from the filthy towers to devastate the Middenland artillery, while hordes of frenzied warriors poured from the gates to butcher the army.</p>\n<p>The Blightkings remain in Brass Keep to this day. Some believe they are sustained by daemonic power; others that Morath’s necromantic magics still act to prevent death. Whatever the reason, the political differences between the Todbringers, Kärzburdgers, and other Empire provinces have ensured that no unified force can assemble to defeat this very visible but darkly powerful Enemy Within.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/blight-king.webp\" width=\"488\" height=\"439\" /></div>","folder":"rFdWy2j3CtQIsdy6","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Brass Keep","sort":0}}}

{"_id":"3dFMCO9loaU7wsn8","name":"Villainous Factions","content":"<p>Up until this point in the campaign the GM and the Players may have regarded the Purple Hand, or the Skaven, as cohesive groups with common purposes. During The Horned Rat, though, the fact that these enemies are split into factions, with divergent purposes, begins to influence events. Whilst it isn’t important that Characters become aware of this (confusion on their part is appropriate), the GM should benefit from understanding these divisions.</p>\n<h3>The Purple Hand</h3>\n<p>Purple Hand is regionally isolated into separate cells, within which are three Ordos: the Ordo Impedimentae, Ordo Terribilis, and Ordo Novitiae. Members of the Purple Hand are kept ignorant of one another. Even the Ordos’ leaders only meet whilst disguised. At conclaves members may gather, but once initiated a member only comes into regular contact with their immediate superior and the few cultists they work alongside.</p>\n<p>But there are exceptions. A few years ago an important member of the Purple Hand began to lobby for reorganisation, contacting cells throughout the Empire, and working to centralise the cult. This was Kastor Lieberung, the Magister Impedimentae of the Nuln Cell.</p>\n<p>Why Kastor wished to reorganise the cult, and how he found the energy to do so, will become clear in Empire in Ruins. Kastor’s activities attracted the attention of a bounty hunter, @Compendium[wfrp4e-eis.eisactors.echM0Sjy5xpt5KAQ]{Adolphus Kuftsos}, who coaxed him to Bögenhafen to collect a fortune.</p>\n<p>Kastor contacted his fellows to inform them that he would soon receive a windfall. However, he then ceased communications, leaving the cult even more divided. Kastor was sighted in the Reikland, but refused to cooperate with cultists who approached him.</p>\n<h4>The Purple Hand in Middenheim</h4>\n<p>Recently the Purple Hand in Middenheim was thrown into disarray when one of the city’s Law Lords, Karl-Heinz Wasmeier, was unmasked as their leader and fled. Rumours have it that Kastor, or Kastor’s associates, had a hand in this disaster. Leaderless and paranoid that they are soon to receive a visit from the Watch, Wasmeier’s lieutenants prepare themselves for trouble. </p>\n<h4>The Purple Hand in Altdorf</h4>\n<p>As Middenheim’s Purple Hand disintegrates, the cult in Altdorf advance their own plans. Kastor had been cooperating with the Altdorf cell to corrupt the throne of the Emperor and instigate civil war.</p>\n<p>Kastor’s sudden change of behaviour, his failure to deliver promised funds, and the bungling of cult operations in Middenheim, has convinced the Altdorf cell to expedite their plans. Their activities feature in <strong>Empire in Ruins</strong>, though clues as to their intentions may be discovered during <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>.</p>\n<h3>The Skaven</h3>\n<p>The Purple Hand are a model of efficiency compared to the labyrinthine designs directing Skavendom. The following summaries explain the motives of the major Skaven factions in <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, but even within these factions there are individuals who would undermine the plans of their superiors if they were to sense profit in it.</p>\n<h4>@JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack}, The Warlock Engineer of Karak Skygg</h4>\n<p>The Council of Thirteen granted permission to @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack}, a talented warlock master of Clan Skryre, to occupy @JournalEntry[92p1UuxbKSkJsKps]{Karak Skygg} in the Middle Mountains in order to construct a huge Warp lightning cannon that he boasts will be capable of blasting chunks of Warpstone from the surface of Morrslieb. If Maliss pulls off his operation, he will be rich and powerful.</p>\n<p>But Maliss is greedy, and hopes to retain as much of the haul for himself as he can. Clan Skryre’s rivals predict that the Warpstone haul could make Clan Skryre an even greater power within Skavendom, so they plan to help or hinder the operation depending on their hopes for alliance with the Warlock Engineers.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>CRACKING CODES</em></h3>\n<p><em>Whilst investigating the Purple Hand, the Characters may find coded messages. These are meant to be fun and provide clues to Players and hint at wider developments. They do not carry information essential to the plot of the adventure, so if Players are unable to solve them it will not inhibit progress.</em></p>\n<p><em>However, it may frustrate Players to miss important information, or they might spend time cracking codes when the GM would prefer them to get on with the adventure. Here is a suggested approach to codes to keep them as a fun distraction rather than a frustrating dead end.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Let the Players have a go at cracking the code without assistance either in or out of character.</em><br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>If progress is slow, allow an <strong>Average (+20) Intelligence Test</strong> to and provide a clue (such as pointing out how to substitute a symbol) for each SL scored. Multiple Characters can take the test and combine SLs. </em><br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>Provide more clues for every 15 minutes of in-game time as a Character spends on the code - so if two people are working on a letter for 30 minutes, give them 4 letters in addition to any other progress they make.</em><br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>Allow intelligent NPCs to quickly crack the code if they are asked to. Schutzmann is a fine code cracker. An exception to this is any code written in Dark Tongue, which takes time to crack unless the NPC is already familiar with it, or has access to a partially cracked code (such as the one found in the @JournalEntry[73yadEanBzBvwq1f]{Jarmund residence}.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Clan Mange</h4>\n<p>Clan Mange is a minor Clan whose members find a niche within Skaven society by hiring themselves out as mercenaries to more powerful clans. They have pledged themselves to Maliss in the hope of being rewarded with Warpstone.</p>\n<p>Whilst the Clan Mange Skaven serve @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Maliss} loyally, he is sending them on increasingly dangerous missions, hoping to thin out their numbers to the point where he can enslave them. The leaders of Clan Mange have not realised his ulterior motive.</p>\n<h4>Under-Middenheim</h4>\n<p>The lair of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim} is mostly populated by Skaven of Clan Scrutens, though @JournalEntry[QcVM1YRuOEjblPll]{Clans Pestilens}, @JournalEntry[XzJenEYTArBENmQA]{Eshin} and @JournalEntry[GDJrTdC0a8HHqyr8]{Moulder} also have a presence there. @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Castellan-Warlord Skrray} tightly controls movement and resources, partly because of a need to maintain the lair’s secrecy, but mostly because he is a gleeful tyrant.</p>\n<p>Skrray knows about @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Maliss Manrack’s} plans, but resents that he is expected to allow Clan Mange access to his territory. During The Horned Rat he loses patience and starts to punish Clan Mange. This is intended to annoy Maliss but has the opposite effect of amusing him no end. The weaker Clan Mange become the better for him.</p>\n<h4>Snikkit’s Warband</h4>\n<p>Snikkit is (or was) an oddity in Skaven society, a clanless mercenary whose band were willing to work for any master willing to pay in food, slaves, or Warpstone. Due to a connection with @Actor[Sy0829M1A3fxm57R]{Vizier Bahr}, @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit} ran errands for the Purple Hand, kidnapping the niece of Law Lord Erlich and assassinating the Crown Prince von Tasseninck to sow discord between Ostland and Talabecland, but was also commissioned by Maliss to help undermine Clan Mange.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Snikkit, his operations ran the risk of discovery by bold adventurers, so by this point he is likely either dead (if the Characters encountered him in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>), or soon to be (if they did not).</p>\n<h3>The Yellow Fang in Middenheim</h3>\n<p>Human worshippers of the Horned Rat are rare, but they do exist. The governing ethos of the cult is a belief that humanity’s dominance is drawing to a close and that the Skaven, a younger and more vigorous species, will inherit in their place. In a forlorn hope that the Skaven will reward Humans who aid their ascension the Yellow Fang assist the Skaven where they can. The cult is powerful in Carroburg, and only exists in Middenheim as a small splinter of around 25 cultists, most of whom are also members of Middenheim’s Sewer Jacks.</p>\n<p>The Yellow Fang have contacts with Clan Scrutens agents in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim}. This used to be a rewarding collaboration as much information was shared. However, since he came to power in Under-Middenheim Castellan-Warlord Gnawretch Skrray has locked down much of this activity. The Yellow Fang have been reduced to performing perfunctory clean-up and cover-up operations.</p>\n<p>Recently Clan Mange Skaven in the service of @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack} have contacted the Yellow Fang. Now they are busy again, performing thefts and abductions to provide resources for Maliss Manrack’s Moonbreaker.</p>\n<p>Cultists of the Yellow Fang often remove one of their front incisors, which is worn around their neck as a sign of their devotion. In Middenheim senior cult members disguise the loss with dentures, which tend to be a little awkward-looking.  </p>\n<p>@Actor[uL6CLyF3u6QpRDQ9]{Raina Müs}. The Yellow Fang’s most accomplished cultist, Müs is a senior Sewer Jack who indoctrinates her patrol and ensures they misdirect any enquiries about Skaven presence in the sewers. She also uses the sewers to contact Skaven scouts and conduct rites to the Horned Rat.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr Lanzaro Lindwurm</strong>. Professor of infectious diseases at the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}. He coordinates the discrediting of proponents of the existence of Skaven. Recently, at @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Maliss Manrack’s} urging (and to Gnawretch Skrray’s dismay), he has turned his efforts to vilifying cats.</p>\n<p><strong>Karl and Gaius</strong>. A pair of porters at the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}. They aid Professor Lindwurm and perform legwork and enforcement for the cult.</p>\n<p><strong>Hauke Ayinger</strong>. A secretary of the Ratters’ Guild who works to ensure that anyone enquiring about the Skaven is first pumped for information, and then subsequently misled or done away with.</p>\n<p><strong>Schmidt</strong>. An old man with no connections outside the cult. He wraps himself in rags and performs a passable impression of a Skaven. He follows proponents of the existence of Skaven about, begging in a squeaky voice to be given money to buy cheese. If he is accused of being a Skaven he finds the suggestion laughable, but if he is forced to unmask he vociferously complains about being bullied, and generally does all he can to embarrass and discredit his harassers.</p>\n<p>Every thirteenth of the month these operatives meet in the basement of a building in the Freiburg district to share information and discuss new plans.

{"_id":"4DubEPyPqEp6iaAJ","name":"Into the Middle Mountains","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/mountain-scene.webp\" /></div>\n<p>In the aftermath of the disastrous Clan Mange attack on Brass Keep, the Characters have enough information to work out the location of Karak Skygg. Depending on their actions at the picket, @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} may be convinced of their good intentions and offer to help them. The Characters shouldn’t expect much, given the parlous state of the picket, but they can at least replenish rations and drinking water. If they are on good terms with Emmiline or other NPCs, they may provide further help.</p>\n<h3>Requisitions</h3>\n<p>If she has a good opinion of them, @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} is willing to offer basic supplies. @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Quartermaster Habicht} can supply equipment if the Characters are lacking appropriate supplies and have not turned him in for his crimes. He can supply (or sell, if they don’t think to blackmail him) rope, basic travelling furs, and enough tents to shelter the party. He warns them, ‘<em>These mountains are harsh. The tallest peaks have never seen a single summer, it’s Ulric’s own domain. This stuff will only take you so far. If ’n you want to survive out there, you want to be just as harsh.’</em></p>\n<h3>Horses For Courses</h3>\n<p>@Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Captain Tylik} may offer to buy any horses the Characters possess, or to take care of them until they return. The terrain towards Karak Skygg will be extremely dangerous for horses, and they are likely to die or break legs if forced into such hazardous lands. He can provide payment in coin (use the appropriate value from the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.Vgopv7qSA8XlvpX0]{Animals and Vehicles}). You can offer 1GC less than the stated price for ‘<em>wear and tear</em>’, if you feel cruel, or if the Characters have a surprising amount of cash!), or payment in goods (an equivalent value in items from the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.2Yn7wOvwiK7yIJcg]{Miscellaneous Trappings}).</p>\n<h3>An Explosive Finale</h3>\n<p>Degni Rulsson might be willing to part with more explosives or ammunition for any blackpowder weapons, if the Characters are convincing enough, and they made a good impression on him. A Character who also passes a <strong>Very Difficult (–30) Haggle</strong> Test persuades him to part with a @Item[nyUbN0JaeXNQUbUT]{Cinderblast Bomb} for 1GC instead of the usual 3GC. However, if the Characters explain that they are attempting to thwart a Skaven plot, Degni gives them 2 @Item[nyUbN0JaeXNQUbUT]{Cinderblast Bombs} for free, saying, <em>‘Those damned raki took my sister some seventy years back. You give ’em a bloody nose with these, and my family might consider her avenged.’ </em></p>\n<h4>Travel Advice</h4>\n<p>Before the Characters leave the picket, they may seek advice from the various contacts they have made there. If the Characters do not seek advice, then they will have to face every single hazard and encounter listed in this chapter as they make their way to Karak Skygg, so asking friendly folk at the picket is a good way of making things easier for them. Kärzburdger forces have been stationed here a long time, and Emmiline’s scouts know the immediate region well.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline}</h4>\n<p>Emmiline has had to direct foraging parties to scour the mountains, and benefits from generations of hard won knowledge about the area, so her advice is the most useful. If asked she tries to help as best she can, but stresses that her knowledge of the Middle Mountains only extends as far as the immediate region around Brass Keep. She does, however, possess charts by military cartographers which are almost certainly more detailed than anything the Characters have. Large parts of the Middle Mountains are too dangerous for surveyors to map, but what details they have noted may be of help to the Characters in planning a route to Karak Skygg.</p>\n<p>The map presents a dilemma. A lost Dwarf Hold is shown on the map, but it is surrounded by a swathe of territory marked ‘Haunt of the Deff Batz’. A route bypasses this area, but it is busy with tall peaks. With the help of this map the Characters have a choice: either they can avoid encounters with Goblins (but face all the other Mountain Hazards and Encounters), or they can avoid Hidden Drops, Altitude Sickness and Landslides (but must cross Deff Batz territory).</p>\n<p>It’s up to the Characters to plan their own route, but Emmiline points out the risks. <em>‘It’s a mountain range, of course you’ll have to climb some mountains! The weather can turn at the drop of a hat. The wind and rain will freeze you to death if you’re not careful. We know there are Goblins up there, and Wyverns, and Trolls. The gods alone know what else you might find, but I doubt any of it is friendly.’</em></p>\n<h4>@Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik}</h4>\n<p>Captain Tylik has little advice to give, though he suggests taking along a goat or two. ‘ <em>You may need an emergency meal, not for yourselves, but to satisfy the appetite of a Troll, should you encounter one’.</em> Goats can be purchased from the picket at three times the price they would otherwise command (the soldiers are not happy to surrender a source of fresh milk, even if goat’s milk is a bit … gamey). The goats could indeed be useful if surrendered to a monster with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.xneBqGOs1QS7kfUr]{Hungry} Trait.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni}</h4>\n<p>Degni Rulsson gives the Characters well-meant but patronising advice about wrapping up warm and making sure they get enough sleep. If he is asked about Night Goblins, he grows grim and lists the names of several ancestors and friends who fell in dozens of subterranean conflicts. <em>‘Be wary of their traps. You wouldn’t think it to look at them but when it comes to creating devices in order to make mischief Grobi can be cunning engineers.’</em></p>\n<h4>@Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund}</h4>\n<p>As a follower of Myrmidia Priestess, Hildegund is a useful source of strategic insight. She can provide any of the advice offered by other NPCs, plus the following titbits of information:</p>\n<p><em>‘Goblins can be bargained with, don’t let any Sigmarite or Dwarf hear it, but if you are willing to trade intoxicants in order to obtain the right of passage they can prove honourable.’</em> (Hildegund will not offer this advice to a devout Sigmarite or a Dwarf.)</p>\n<p><em>‘Keep something flammable on you at all times. Many creatures who haunt the mountains are adverse to fire, and it robs Trolls of their healing abilities.’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘There are vengeful spirits who haunt narrow passes in mountainsides. If you see a lone figure it is likely to be a wraith or spectre.’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘The Skaven assault on Brass Keep never stood a chance. It is almost deliberate in its total incompetence. Is the mastermind behind it a fool, or did he want his army to shatter?’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘The Wide-Mouthed Mountain Viper is occasionally encountered, they bask in the open during sunny spells, and can be hard to spot among the rocks. They have a nasty bite, but are more afraid of you than you are of them.’</em></p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/mountain-scene.webp","folder":"wcl7UoecQXn9SThP","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Into the Middle Mountains","sort":100000}}}

One might think the arrival of the Characters would provide a welcome distraction, but the Yellow Fang have seen to it that they will receive a frosty reception.</p>\n<p>The picket is positioned a few miles west of the keep itself, at the mouth of a mountain pass. Efforts to create a picket closer to the keep failed, as the Blightkings would launch harrying sorties in the night, and strange illnesses would lay the garrison low. No serious attempt has been made on the keep in decades, and now the picket serves only to stop anyone from entering or leaving the pass.</p>\n<p>An agent of the Yellow Fang, @Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Sergeant Otfried Brantner}, has been embedded at the picket, keeping Clan Mange informed of any developments there. He has been told of the Characters’ imminent arrival and instructed to hinder them as much as possible. To that end, he has been spreading malicious rumours about the Characters, including that they are here to seize control of the picket from the Kärzburdger family in the name of Graf Todbringer.</p>\n<h4>Picket People</h4>\n<p>The picket is commanded by @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline von Kärzburdger}, and the 200 soldiers assigned here are Kärzburdger men-at-arms. The Kärzburdgers are too proud to ask for assistance in maintaining the picket, but lack the wealth to afford more than a nominal force. Emmiline has heard rumours about the Characters’ arrival and is worried. She is a proud woman, and knows that the picket is in poor condition.</p>\n<p>@Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} is assisted by @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund Froiz}, a priestess of Myrmidia. Hildegund worries about the poor condition of the picket, and thinks the Kärzburdgers’ enmity with the Graf distracts from the threat of Brass Keep. She pays little heed to rumours about the Characters, and is curious as to their purpose.</p>\n<p>Quartermaster @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Willus Habicht} controls the picket’s supplies. Habicht considers his current assignment beneath him, and has decided to leave the Kärzburdgers’ service. In order to finance his new life, he has been skimming funds, buying poor or insufficient supplies and keeping the savings. He sees the Characters’ arrival as another opportunity for profit, as he happily sells out his masters for a little coin.</p>\n<p>Artillerist @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni Rulsson} is in charge of the picket’s one cannon, ‘Astrid’. Degni was assigned here due to his propensity for blowing things up. He has had to curtail his experiments with explosives due to a shortage of blackpowder. This has become worse of late, as the blackpowder that arrived in the last shipment was poor quality. Unbeknownst to him, Quartermaster @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht} has been substituting military-grade gunpowder with an inferior product (see @JournalEntry[Y1J01ULcx9MURsXN]{The Mine}). While Degni has overheard rumours about the Characters he really doesn’t care.</p>\n<p>@Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Captain Tylik} leads a detachment (a rota) of 20 Kislevite @Actor[8gC3Z7EdNvOdcsZS]{horse archers}. He and his men are baffled as to why they have been tasked with guarding a mountain pass, an unsuitable task for a cavalry unit. Still, Middenheim and Kislev exchange troops on a yearly basis in honour of old alliances, and the Kislevites serve without complaint. The Characters’ arrival is the most interesting thing to happen in the six months they have been assigned here, and they’re hoping entertainment ensues.</p>\n<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-around\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/emmiline-von-karzburdger.webp\" width=\"276\" height=\"347\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Commander Emmiline von Kärzburdger}</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/hildegund-froiz.webp\" width=\"265\" height=\"364\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Priestess Hildegund Froiz}</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-around\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/degni-rulsson.webp\" width=\"368\" height=\"303\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Artellerist Degni Rulsson}</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/willus-habicht.webp\" width=\"246\" height=\"281\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Quartermaster Willus Habicht}</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-around\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/tylik.webp\" width=\"235\" height=\"378\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Horse Captain Tylik}</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/otfried-brantner.webp\" width=\"315\" height=\"373\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Sergeant Otfried Brantner}</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>The Arrival</h3>\n<p>The Characters are still a mile from the picket when a dozen Ungol horsemen emerge from a thicket of trees and greet them. They are led by @Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Captain Tylik}, who gruffly tells the Characters they were expected. Any Character making an <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test notices a wisp of smoke rising from the thicket Tylik’s men emerged from. The Ungols have a camp there, where they have a makeshift still. If asked, Tylik waves it off, stating that he left a few men there to watch the western approaches.</p>\n<p>@Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik} leads the party over the next rise, bringing the picket into view. The mountains rise above it, dwarfing the ramshackle collection of buildings and tents at the mouth of the pass. A line of six long grey-stone houses sits across from a large warehouse-like structure. To the south is a small square building, which has large, open doors on its northern and southern sides. A stream passes to the south of the buildings, next to which stands a corral of horses and a stable, and (downstream) a line of outhouses. The stream emerges from under a palisade of earth and wood, which stretches north and south to either side of the pass. Even from a distance, the Characters can see that the palisade is in poor repair. A single gate sits in the middle of the wall, with a rickety wooden tower standing above it.</p>\n<p>Beyond the palisade lies the pass itself. The mountains cast it into shadow, and it twists and turns, making it difficult to see very far. Any Character with @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.mNoCuaVbFBflfO6X]{Sixth Sense} will feel a foreboding chill upon seeing the pass, while a Character with @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} notes tendrils of <em>Dhar </em>drifting out of the pass, dissipating as they come into the sunlight.</p>\n<h4>A Warm Welcome</h4>\n<p>As @Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik} leads them closer, the garrison begins to take notice. An <strong>Easy (+40) Intuition</strong> Test reveals that the Characters are not welcome. Soldiers stop what they’re doing and glare at them. There seems to be more to it than a stereotypical Middenlander orneriness. There’s active hostility in some gazes, and several observers meaningfully heft weapons as the Characters pass. </p>\n<p>As they approach the barracks, @Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik} leaves them with @Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Sergeant Brantner}, who seems amiable. He leads them to the Commander’s quarters, making casual chit-chat along the way. Brantner is eager to meet the Characters as he is hoping to gain material he can use to spread more rumours. He asks them about their journey, the weather, their experiences in Middenheim — anything to get them talking. An <strong>Opposed Intuition/Cool Test</strong> reveals he seems keen to engage all the Characters, being sure to include each of them in the conversation.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>SLANDEROUS RUMOURS</em></h3>\n<p><em>@Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Brantner} has been spreading all kinds of tales about the Characters, but was limited by the information the Yellow Fang was able to provide him. If the Characters successfully neutralised most of the Fang agents they encountered, then Brantner had little to work with. The rumours about them are vague, mostly just suggesting that they are the Graf’s agents. If, however, most of the Yellow Fang’s agents survived to reach the picket, Brantner’s rumours will disparage various aspects of the Characters’ species, personalities, careers, or histories. The more Brantner has to work with, the poorer the view among the garrison is, and the more hostile their reception.</em></p>\n<p><em>Increase the difficulty of social tests the Characters make when interacting with the soldiers at the picket by one to three steps, depending on how much information Brantner had to work with.</em></p>\n<p><em>Create rumours tailored to the Characters, based on incidents in their adventuring careers, and especially their encounters in Middenheim. The more the Yellow Fang knows about them, the more accurate the rumours are. If a Character fought off thugs in the street, Brantner’s rumours cast them as ‘The Butcher of Brotkopfs’, killer of soldiers in a street brawl covered up on the Graf’s orders. If a Character is a licensed Wizard who enjoys using the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.4ePe5oNQakA8nJlk]{Sleep} spell, they are known as ‘The Wynd’s Own Warlock’, who curses their enemies to appear dead only to awaken as they are tossed off the Cliff of Sighs.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>A Commanding Presence</h4>\n<p>When they arrive at @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline’s} quarters, the Characters are met by @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Priestess Hildgeund}. She is wearing white robes edged in red, and a silver eagle hangs on a chain around her neck. A <strong>Very Easy (+60) Lore (Theology)</strong> or an <strong>Average (+20) Lore (Reikland or Middenland) </strong>Test identifies her as a priestess of Myrmidia. She dismisses @Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Brantner} (who is visibly annoyed by this, and complains loudly once outside) and welcomes the Characters. She apologises on behalf of Commander von Kärzburdger, explaining that @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} is busy with paperwork. </p>\n<p>This is not true (<strong>Very Easy (+60) Intuition</strong> Test to notice, as @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund} doesn’t like to lie); @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} wants to make the Characters wait. Hildegund answers any of the Characters’ questions, and is in turn keen to learn more about their purpose at the picket. If the Characters mention Skaven to her, she listens attentively. While she has never fought them herself, she has heard stories from Tilean mercenaries of hordes of ratmen pouring from marshlands or mountain holds, wielding strange magics and terrible weapons. She was never quite sure whether these stories were true, but she is more open to tales of Skaven than most. See the Evidence Table below for her exact opinion on the matter.</p>\n<p>After ten minutes the door to @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline’s} office opens, and she greets them. She is polite, but cold. She asks about their purpose, and tells them they are not to go beyond the palisade without her express permission. If asked why, Emmiline explains that anyone travelling closer to the Brass Keep is likely to be killed, or (even worse) captured, tortured, and then released, bringing disease back with them. If further pressed (for example, if a Character insists that they have the Graf ’s authority), she reluctantly admits that she worries about provoking the Blighters. She fears that her forces at the picket are not strong enough to defeat an all-out attack. She considers requests to scout Brass Keep, but is not willing to allow it at this time.</p>\n<p>She has no patience for talk of ratmen or Yellow Fang agents. There have been no sightings of beastmen (‘<em>rat-headed or otherwise</em>’), and she won’t abide questioning of her men’s loyalty.</p>\n<p>@Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} ends the meeting by telling the Characters to speak with Quartermaster @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht} regarding lodgings and supplies. She assigns ‘Hildee’ (Priestess Hildegund) to liaise with them — if they have further questions, she can answer them.</p>\n<h4>Getting Settled</h4>\n<p>@Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund} accompanies the Characters to @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht’s} office in the storehouse. He informs them that as there is no room in the barracks to house them, he’ll set aside space in the storeroom and requisition bunks from the regular soldiers. He tries to be as helpful and charming as possible, telling them he is at their disposal.</p>\n<p>@Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht} will try to arrange a meeting with the Characters that evening, ‘<em>just to ensure all their needs are being met.’ </em>An <strong>Average (+20) Intuition</strong> Test reveals he has something he wants to share, but not with @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund} present.</p>\n<p>As they are leaving, @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni Rulsson} storms into the office. He ignores the Characters and immediately begins berating @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht} over the quality of the latest shipment of blackpowder (‘<em>not fit to blow up a Grobi’s backside!’</em>). Habicht hurriedly bids the Characters goodbye and closes the office door.</p>\n<h3>Exploring the Picket</h3>\n<p>Once they are settled, @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund} leaves the Characters to their own devices. They are free to explore the picket, but are not allowed across the palisade. If they try, the guards on duty intercept them, and let them know that if they try it again they will be shot ‘as a mercy’. In order to gain permission to cross the picket the Characters need to win the Commander’s trust — or find a way to force her hand.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Skaven Evidence Table - The Picket</em></h3>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:221px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:29.2055%;height:17px\">\n<p><strong><em>Current Evidence Score</em></strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:70.7945%;height:17px\"><strong><em>@Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Priestess Hildegund’s} and @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline von Kärzburdger’s} reaction</em></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:119px\">\n<td style=\"width:29.2055%;height:119px\"><em>Undeniable (3 or more)</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:70.7945%;height:119px\"><em>Hildegund has heard the recent rumours of Skaven activity, and pays close attention to any news of them.

However, a particularly charming (or intimidating) Character might be able to glean information.</p>\n<p>If the Characters press the soldiers as to where they heard these rumours, the best they’ll get is a shrug and that they ‘<em>heard it playing dice</em>’. Most of them didn’t actually hear the rumours from @Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Brantner’s} own mouth (they were passed on by other soldiers), and he was always careful to suggest he himself heard the rumour from someone else in the camp. However, they’ll admit they first heard the rumours a few days ago — shortly after the Characters left Middenheim. None of the soldiers recall any messengers or supply trains arriving in that time, so where the knowledge of their arrival came from is a mystery.</p>\n<h4>The Ungol Detachment</h4>\n<p>The Characters find a warmer reception from @Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik} and @Actor[8gC3Z7EdNvOdcsZS]{his men}. Though gruff, the Ungols pay no heed to the rumours plaguing the camp, and judge the Characters on their own merits. They respect anyone with good horsemanship, skill at arms, or the ability to hold their drink. They are boastful by nature, and expect the Characters to be the same. This may lead to a challenge (horse riding, sword fighting, wrestling, or drinking are all popular), and whether they win or lose, the horse archers respect them for trying.</p>\n<p>If they spend time with the Ungols, the Characters notice they always seem to have a bottle of kvas (a popular Kislevite drink) handy. The Ungols brew it in their still, hidden in the woods, but it’s of poor quality. Any Character with an appropriate skill — such as Lore (Chemistry, Engineering) or Trade (Brewer, Cook, Engineer, Smith) — can help them improve their results with advice on the ingredients, process, or improvements to the still. This wins their lasting friendship (and a bottle of kvas). Characters drinking kvas must take <strong>Hard (–20) Consume Alcohol</strong> Tests. Anyone becoming @Table[stinking-drunk]{Stinking Drunk} automatically gets the ‘How Did I Get Here<em>’</em> result.</p>\n<p>Characters may discover the still by investigating the Ungol camp in the woods, shadowing @Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik} or his men as they go back and forth, or just by chatting with the horse archers. If they decide to discreetly tell von Kärzburdger about it, she appreciates them bringing it to her attention. She won’t do anything about it (yet), as destroying it would be bad for morale, but knowing it is there means she can make sure it doesn’t become a problem. Their honesty also causes her to reconsider her initial impression of the Characters, though it takes more to win her trust.</p>\n<h4>A Quiet Word</h4>\n<p>If the Characters do not approach @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht}, he eventually goes to them and seeks a word in private. He starts an odd conversation, initially dancing around the subject, before dropping hints, and eventually (if they don’t figure it out) asking them for a bribe in exchange for his testimony against Commander @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline von Kärzburdger}. The Characters may be confused by this, but Habicht explains that he knows why they’re here — to humiliate the Kärzburdgers! Everyone in the camp knows.</p>\n<p>@Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht} discusses anything of interest to the Characters in exchange for a few coins. He also answers questions they have about the picket. One piece of information he has is the identity of the rumourmonger — @Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Sergeant Brantner}. Habicht has been paying attention to gossip around the camp, wary that his embezzlement has been detected. He noticed that Brantner was spreading rumours about the Characters. Habicht jumped to the conclusion that Brantner overheard @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} and @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund} discussing the Characters’ mission to the picket — after all, how else could he have known they were coming?</p>\n<p>If @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht} is accused of selling blackpowder to the Yellow Fang, he initially denies it, but an <strong>Average (+20) Intimidate</strong> Test gets him to crack. If this test fails, Habicht first insists that the Characters promise not to divulge his involvement in the trade to anyone, before revealing that @Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Brantner} arranged for the sale to ‘an old army buddy’. He does not know who the Yellow Fang might be, but assumes they are contacts of Brantner’s.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Brantner} is accused he denies any involvement and claims that @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht} is covering up his own illegal dealings. While it is clear that something untoward is afoot, Emmiline is unwilling to arrest any of her ‘loyal’ troops on the word of Todbringer lapdogs — at least not without further evidence.</p>\n<h4>Dealing with the Dwarf</h4>\n<p>If the Characters spend any time in the Storehouse, they notice @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni} stomping about, muttering angrily. He ignores them unless approached, upon which he’ll happily tell them about his troubles. While he has things to say about the poor food (‘<em>Umgi slop!’</em>), terrible accommodation (‘<em>Why is it all aboveground, I ask you?’</em>), and bad company (‘<em>Right irritable, the lot of them, and that’s coming from a Dwarf!’</em>), his biggest gripe is the blackpowder @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht} has provided (‘<em>Too much smoke, not enough BOOM!’</em>). He’s set aside the latest shipment, as he doesn’t want to get it mixed up with the last of ‘<em>the good stuff ’</em>. He’s baffled as to why Habicht keeps buying such terrible powder, as he gave the Quartermaster careful instructions when putting in his last order. He suspects Habicht is either an imbecile, or just hates him and wants to deprive him of ever experiencing a true explosion again.</p>\n<p>If any of the Characters is a Dwarf, an engineer, or conveys an appreciation for blackpowder weapons, fire, or explosions, @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni} shows them his side project. While @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht’s} blackpowder isn’t good enough for use with Astrid, Degni’s found another use for it: bombs. He has filled four ale kegs with blackpowder and attached fuses. Treat as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.X8WFQf0HB9yXKjdD]{bombs} with the Bulky Flaw.</p>\n<h3>The First Night</h3>\n<p>In an attempt to hinder the Characters’ activities, @Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Brantner} convinces five soldiers to ‘<em>teach them a lesson</em>’. They wait until after midnight and then approach the Storehouse. The two guards on duty are convinced to take an ‘<em>outhouse break</em>’, and the attackers make their way to the Characters’ room.</p>\n<p>If a Character is on watch they hear the attackers approaching. If all Characters are asleep, they must pass a <strong>Very Hard (–30) Perception</strong> Test to wake up as the attackers enter the room, otherwise they wake up after being attacked. A waking Character starts with the @Condition[Fatigued], @Condition[Prone] and @Condition[Surprised] Conditions.</p>\n<p>The soldiers don’t want to kill the Characters, just hurt them. They @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.Ssod4QuBdyMS6F79]{pull their blows}, and stop striking a Character once they reach 0 Wounds. They aren’t looking for a real fight, and flee if any of them are injured. If captured, they won’t reveal @Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Brantner’s} involvement unless a Character wins an <strong>Opposed Challenging (+0) Intimidate/Average (+20) Cool</strong> Test. Each of the soldiers has 20 silver shillings, which Brantner gave them as a little extra incentive for the attack.</p>\n<h3>The Second Night</h3>\n<p>If @Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Brantner} is still at large on the second night after the Characters’ arrival, he decides to eliminate them once and for all. He steals a barrel of blackpowder from @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni’s} stores, then places it outside the Storehouse, next to the Characters’ room. If any Character is on watch, they may hear Brantner struggling with the barrel with an <strong>Opposed Perception/Stealth</strong> Test.</p>\n<p>Brantner lays a trail of blackpowder to the barrel, then runs. Thankfully, the barrel he picked is filled with poor quality blackpowder, and the explosion isn’t as powerful as it should be. Anyone in the room takes 12 Damage (minus TB) and receives the @Condition[Prone] and @Condition[Stunned] Conditions. They must also make an <strong>Average (+20) Endurance </strong>Test or receive an @Condition[Unconscious] Condition. The explosion blows a hole in the wall, and the room fills with smoke. Anyone in the room must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test each round or gain a @Condition[Poisoned] Condition, which remains until they are clear of the smoke.</p>\n<p>@Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Brantner} hides nearby, and if he sees a Character emerge from the Storehouse he decides it’s time to flee the picket. Soldiers stream from the barracks, but a Character making a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception </strong>Test spots Brantner scurrying away into the darkness, and can give chase. Alternatively, an <strong>Easy (+40) Track</strong> Test can pick up his trail.</p>\n<h3>Brantner Captured</h3>\n<p>Throughout their stay at the picket, @Actor[KELAtNjsvaCemSQx]{Brantner} keeps an eye on the Characters. If he suspects that @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht} has sold him out, or if they survive his attempt to kill them, he flees into the woods, where he has hidden a backpack with supplies and the last of his gold. While he won’t go down without a fight, he surrenders immediately if reduced below 6 Wounds, or if he suffers a Critical Wound. If interrogated, he cracks if a Character wins an <strong>Opposed Intimidate/Cool</strong> Test. Unfortunately he knows little of his masters’ plans. He was occasionally contacted by a Skaven agent, who would demand updates on activities at the picket. They would ask whether the Commander was sending any patrols into the mountains, and if there had been any activity from the keep. The last contact warned him that the Characters were coming, and ordered him to hinder them. </p>\n<p>In addition, he was to do anything he could to acquire plans of Brass Keep (which he has not located yet), and to do anything possible to reduce the readiness of the garrison (he considers his part in the @JournalEntry[Y1J01ULcx9MURsXN]{gunpowder plot}) to have covered this. He does not know why he was asked to do these things, but will mention that the ‘secret master’ he spoke to seemed even more agitated and restless than normal.</p>\n<h3>LOCATIONS</h3>\n<h4>The Barracks</h4>\n<p>The picket’s garrison is accommodated in six grey-stone buildings, arrayed in a line. They were built with defence in mind, with small doorways and windows that let in little light, while failing to keep in the heat.</p>\n<p>Five of the buildings house the Kärzburdger regular troops, with 40 soldiers in each. Space is tight, with the soldiers’ double-bunks squeezed next to each other, and weapon racks and personal belongings packed in wherever possible. Each has a large fireplace at one end, and a bunk nearer to the heat of the fire is a common stake in the soldiers’ dice games.</p>\n<p>The sixth building is the officers’ quarters. It has been divided into a parlour, a bedroom (shared by @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} and @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund}), an office, a small kitchen, and a meeting room. It is far more spacious and comfortably appointed than the barrack-houses.</p>\n<h4>The Storehouse</h4>\n<p>The largest building at the picket, the storehouse includes a larder, kitchen, mess-hall, quarters for Quartermaster @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht} and Artillerist @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Rulsson}, as well as store rooms full of spare weapons, ammunition, and Astrid, the picket’s cannon. There are always two guards stationed at the front door, but off-duty soldiers can usually be found here at any hour. The soldiers take turns preparing meals, which are served at first light and an hour before nightfall.</p>\n<p>If the Characters check the blackpowder barrels, they find them stacked next to Astrid. Each bears the Kärzburdger family crest, but several crests are crudely printed on. If asked about this, @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni} admits that those barrels arrived in the last shipment, but he didn’t think anything of it at the time.</p>\n<p>@Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht’s} quarters include a small desk where he keeps his records. These are a mess, as he has intentionally made them as confusing as possible. It will take several hours to read through his accounts and figure out what he has been doing, unless a Character has either the <em>Research </em>Skill or the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.HIofcsDLjXGKzSZf]{Embezzle} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.5QcrpLQWWrsbKR79]{Numismatics} Talents, in which case it will take ten minutes. However, someone searching his desk who succeeds in a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test hears coins clinking as they pull out a drawer. Pulling the drawer completely free of the desk reveals a small box, in which they’ll find @Credit[164gc SPLIT]{164 GC}, wrapped in cloth.</p>\n<p>@Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{Habicht} clears out one of the store rooms to make space for the Characters. Two bunk beds are dragged from the nearest barracks for them (the legs still covered in mud), and he provides some thin blankets and a chest for storing possessions.</p>\n<h4>The Shrine</h4>\n<p>This odd-looking building stands apart from the picket’s other structures. It is square, with double doors on its north and south faces. It contains a single large room, with a wide pillar in the centre stretching from the floor to the ceiling.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>MAKING FRIENDS OR  INFLUENCING PEOPLE</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Characters can try to win @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline’s} respect, or try to browbreat her into submission. If they treat her with respect and do not undermine her command, she accepts that they are there with good intentions. Alternatively, they can use the poor conditions and various problems at the picket to threaten her position. While this angers her, it also provides them with leverage. If the Characters insulted Henricus von Kärzburdger earlier in the adventure Emiline is harder to win over.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Characters might bring any of the following to @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline’s} attention.

The south side of the pillar is carved with an image of Sigmar holding aloft a hammer, the broken bodies of Orcs scattered at his feet. The north side of the pillar is carved with a cruder image of a wolf ’s head over a great flame. Half-melted candles cluster about the base of the pillar, along with various offerings (a few broken or rusted blades, worn bits of armour, the occasional penny).</p>\n<p>While there are devout Sigmarites and Ulricans amongst the garrison, there is little tension between the two groups. Here, at least, the followers of both cults are more concerned with the potential threat of the dark gods than with the petty squabbles of court and cult.</p>\n<p>If a Character spends time sincerely praying at the shrine, they see soldiers on both sides of the pillar, united in their mission to defend the Empire from Chaos. For a moment, the candles seem to burn more brightly, and a sense of purpose fills the Character. They gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.vMYEkrWj0ip6ZOdv]{Resistance (Chaos)} Talent for the next 8 days (a Character can only gain this benefit once).</p>\n<h4>The Stables</h4>\n<p>Situated next to a stream that provides the picket with fresh water, the stables and the neighbouring corral have been expanded since the arrival of @Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Captain Tylik’s} rota. Rather than squeeze into the barracks, the Ungols reside near their horses. A  few Ungols can be found here at all times, tending their mounts. The stables also house @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Commander Emmiline} and @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Priestess Hildegund’s} warhorses (Black Hammer and Peaches). </p>\n<h4>The Picket Wall</h4>\n<p>A crude rampart of earth and stone stretches across the mountain pass, topped with a wooden palisade. There is a ditch on the other side of the wall, but it has grown shallow over the years, and barely presents a challenge to an attacker. The palisade has gaps in a number of places, especially where sections of the rampart have given way due to erosion. The stream passes under the palisade near the southern end, cutting through the rampart. </p>\n<p>The wooden tower overlooking the gate is manned by two crossbowmen during the day, while ten pikemen and another two crossbowmen are stationed next to the gate itself. A small tent has been pitched next to the gate for shelter, and the soldiers have set up a campfire there. During the night, the soldiers occasionally embark on four-man patrols up and down the length of the palisade, but these are easily avoided, as they light their way with lanterns and make no attempt at stealth.</p>\n<p>Beyond the palisade lies the pass. The ground is rocky and bare, with no plant life to be seen. The only movement is that of the stream, which winds down from the mountains.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/picket.webp","folder":"IaBwgEziWaM8yqhn","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Picket","sort":0}}}

Boris Todbringer seems increasingly vital and energetic. This time he does not invite @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} to attend the audience and his attitude to the Characters is of increasing high regard. He asks them to summarise the situations they came across during their investigations., listens as they describe their adventures, then nods to Breughal who leaves the audience chamber.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Thank you for your service,’ <em>he says</em>. ‘This is a tricky situation requiring discretion, I may need the Kärzburdgers’ support in days to come, so cannot be seen to grant permission to interfere with their affairs, but we have given this circumstance serious thought. Please take your leave, my agent will meet you outside and elaborate.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Princess Requests</h3>\n<p>The Characters are led out of the audience chamber to the anteroom, where they find @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.XY9dT0a5Tin6KKAs]{‘Princess’ Katarina} waiting for them with an escort of six Knights Panther. The Characters are immediately struck by her serious demeanor. Gone is the naive young lady they may remember. Recent events have brought to the fore previously hidden reserves of Todbringer steel.</p>\n<p><em>‘Thank you for coming,’ </em>she says<em>. ‘Please join me. There is something I wish to talk to you about.’ </em>The escort forms up around the Princess and the Characters, and they set off in the direction of the gardens. The ‘Princess’ talks as they walk.</p>\n<p><em>‘It’s true then?’ </em>she asks. <em>‘The Skaven are real?’ </em>She listens to what the Characters have to say, briskly bringing them back to the point if they ramble.</p>\n<p><em>‘All this time,’</em> she says with genuine sadness.<em> ‘We all laughed at anyone who made a fuss. Locked them up, even. It’s terrible. My father would like to offer you assistance, but it is imperative that he isn’t seen to be interfering with Kärzburdger business. They own the lands around Brass Keep, and resent my family for our good fortune.’</em></p>\n<h4>She produces a scroll and hands it to the Characters.</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘So I am handing you this charter. It grants you the right to investigate matters at the picket on authority of the Todbringers, but should anyone ask you who gave it to you, tell them the truth: that it was me, not my father. We all accept that answers to some pressing questions can be found at Brass Keep, but if we dispatch a regiment of troops we could find ourselves at war with the Kärzburdgers. Go there and find out all you can, but only make the involvement of my family plain if people refuse to help.’</p>\n<p>‘ Your orders then are to travel to the picket, present yourselves and ask for an audience with Emmiline von Kärzburdger. You are to  explain to her discreetly that the Todbringers have concerns that Skaven seem to be preparing action against Brass Keep, and they are able to deploy a machine to shoot things down from the sky. Reassure her that we have no wish to ordain her family’s affairs, but that any assistance will be greatly appreciated. Do not seek to oblige more from her than she gives willingly.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Katarina invites questions at this point, likely topics of conversation are given here. Even if the Characters are not curious, she warns them not to go to the Keep itself, and to be careful not to offend the Kärzburdgers.</p>\n<h4>Why are the Kärzburdgers not more cooperative?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘The Kärzburdgers were Grafs of Middenheim during the reign of Emperor Magnus, but our own family won the throne a short while later. Many living Kärzburdgers see our rise as a usurpation of their rights. Even those who acknowledge our rule would still regard any interference in their estate as an unwarranted provocation.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Could they be working with the Skaven?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘The Kärzburdgers are prickly and resentful, but since they lost the throne they have not been treasonous or consorted with Dark Powers. They have as much to lose from the corruption of Chaos as any other noble family of the Empire, so I don’t think it is likely.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Why is Brass Keep guarded by a picket?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Legends say the keep was built by a Necromancer who was slain by Sigmar. Later it was garrisoned by soldiers from Middenheim, but it was always costly to man. Accidents occurred there, soldiers fell to corruption. During the Great War Against Chaos an advance party of damned men pledged to the Plague God, the Blighters, stormed the Keep. They have lurked there ever since, kept alive by magical means. The Keep is atop a mountain pass, hard to besiege, and the Kärzburdgers argue that it is better to contain the Blighters there than having to storm and garrison a cursed castle. The Picket is there to keep an eye on the situation and react if the Blighters sally forth.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Do you expect us to enter the Keep?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘That’d be suicide! The Blighters are said to be indomitable. Each is the size of a bloated Ogre, armoured in enchanted plate, and bearing weapons that can kill with a scratch. They have been known to summon daemonic servants and command vile sorcery. Even proximity to the Keep invites infection by their diseases. Observe it if you will, but don’t venture beyond the picket lines.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>We need horses/weaponry/armour/equipment</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Middenheim is grateful for your service. Anything you need just let us know. But employ haste, present Watch Commander Schutzmann with any requests and be ready to leave in the morning.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>The problem is not with Brass Keep, it somewhere else in the Middle Mountains</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘But where? If nothing else investigating the situation at Brass Keep may provide us with more guidance.</p>\n</blockquote>","img":null,"folder":"qPSOCqWeY1xLP2vT","sort":-200000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Road East","sort":-200000}}}

The Hold’s arms and armour were crafted on these levels to the exacting standards of the Dwarf artisans.</p>\n<p>The Skaven have hacked through many of the walls on these levels to create space for their hellish Warpstone refineries and the base of the Moonbreaker Cannon itself. The halls crackle with green lightning and the Skaven engineers’ hissing chatter in their workshops.</p>\n<h4>The Hidden Arsenal</h4>\n<p>At the heart of the mountain is a three storey chamber sealed off with rune magic from the rest of the Hold. Should a Dwarf pass outside the hidden chamber, Khazalid runes appear etched into the stone walls with a faint orange glow. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I, RUNELORD THOGNAR TORBROW LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE DENIZENS OF KARAK SKYGG HAVE RELENTED THIS PLACE. NO DWARF, NOR ANY OTHER SHALL DWELL IN THESE HALLS. SHOULD THEY FALL UNDER THE DOMINION OF FOUL URKS, GROBI, OR ELGI, THIS KARAK SHALL BE RENDERED INTO RUIN. BEYOND THIS WALL, ARE STOWED FULL HUNDRED CASKS OF POWDER FOR THE FIRING. DO WHAT THOU MUST, SON OF GRUNGNI</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If she is with the party, Hetri will see this and whisper a translation urgently to the Characters. She is delighted, informing them that beyond the wall is a chamber full of gunpowder — a final act by the Runesmiths to prevent the hold being defiled. If a Character questions whether it could still be good after centuries, she quickly snaps:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘It’s Dawi-made. I should put you in the Book of Grudges just for asking.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A series of Khazalid runes direct towards a secret door by depressing the eye in a carved Dwarf ancestor face. Inside is an eerie sight — a silent chamber reaching high into the mountain with rows upon rows of sturdy casks piled on wooden racks, over 500 in all. Each has been coated in pitch and dusty. A lead-sealed box contains flints and three fuses long enough to burn for just five minutes.</p>\n<p>However, most of the barrels have spoiled over the years. Characters passing a <strong>Hard (-10) Perception</strong> Test notice a rime of white residue on a barrel if they examine or move it. A Character passing an <strong>Easy (+40) Trade (Apothecary)</strong> or <strong>Lore (Science)</strong> Test can tell that damp has gotten in and spoiled the powder in such cases. There are 10 barrels of unspoiled powder left. They can be used to the same effect as a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.X8WFQf0HB9yXKjdD]{bomb}.</p>\n<h4>Clan Skryre Workshops</h4>\n<p>Through a warren of rooms are the Clan Skryre workshops. These chambers have since been converted, with shafts leading upwards and downwards, through which winches and pulleys raise and lower lifts used to move ore, warpstone, and parts for the cannon. There are further holes in the outer wall of the fortress used to winch up supplies — another means of entry.</p>\n<p>This is where @Actor[E7pge5rgT241TLyD]{Skavenslaves} toil under the watchful eyes of their engineer masters. Furnaces burn, melting stolen ores and recovered metals, so that they may cast parts for the cannon. Powered by coal, steam engines pound ore, tended by scorched Skavenslaves. Warpstone is crushed and taken away in trolleys to be further refined in the levels above. Smaller furnaces turn out weapons and armour, as Clan Skryre prepare for their domination of the Empire once the Morrsleib has been struck.</p>\n<p>The cacophony of machinery and the crackling of electricity makes sneaking about these chambers easier, conferring a +20 bonus to Stealth rolls. Amongst the @Actor[E7pge5rgT241TLyD]{Skavenslaves} are engineers and packmasters, who bear all manner of crackling devices, used to keep the slaves in check. Characters who pass an <strong>Easy (+40) Lore (Engineer) </strong>Test will be able to understand some of the documents that are on workbenches of the engineers, making this an ideal opportunity to sabotage the cannon. Destroying schematics will delay the firing of the weapon, buying the group time for further actions. </p>\n<p>In one of the forges, the party finds a deranged Yellow Fang cultist helping supervise the work. The party can engage with @Actor[A0xZ7cdmHmr6LA9X]{Hermann von Talg} as slaves or Yellow Fang cultists. If they do, give them an <strong>Average (+20) Charm</strong> Test to avoid suspicion. They can learn useful technical information about the Moonbreaker Cannon (including its vulnerabilities), and more about Warlock Engineer @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Maliss Manrack’s} plan. Von Talg is slightly deranged and because of his enthusiasm for Clan Skryre engineering he won’t hold back any information.</p>\n<h4>Who are you?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Marvellous to meet you! Von Talg, formerly of the Imperial Engineers but found them a little limiting, don’t you know? No imagination. Have you seen this? It’s essentially a copper tube, but these runes and this cage actually trap lightning until it’s ready to be released. Incredible!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What are you doing here?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Here to learn, boy! Here to learn! Maliss is a genius. Wasn’t too sure about these hairy chaps at first, but look at all this — he’s a visionary. Makes Leonardo da Miragliano look like a Tilean halfwit!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Who is Maliss?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Only the smartest Warlock Engineer in Clan Skryre! Honestly, I wasted so many years at the Imperial School in Altdorf, or trying to learn from the Dwarfs. But the masters are so much more inventive, always trying something new, and not too squeamish about blowing up a few lab assistants in the name of science.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What can you tell us about the project?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘He’s built this tremendous cannon which shoots green lightning. Calls it the Moonbreaker because, and you’ll like this… because he’s going to use it to blow up Morrslieb.’ </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Tell us more about the Moonbreaker Cannon?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘It’s a pretty smart bit of kit. Fuel builds the charge, charge generates warp lightning, zips up the barrel focused by the runes, jolly powerful ball of lightning blasts from the inductors. Sounds simple doesn’t it? But it’s supremely complicated. Absolutely everything needs to be done to precision. If the Warpfuel is contaminated…  boom! If the induction chamber is misaligned with the charge bore… boom! If the transmission gear rotates a shade too slowly…  You get the idea.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What do you stand to get out of this?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Well, the masters seem to appreciate the work I’m doing for them and I expect Maliss will give me a workshop of my own when the whole moon thing is done. I think he’s taken a shine to me!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>The Refinery</h4>\n<p>These levels have been opened up, with shoddily constructed supports, to house several large bronze-lined vats of bubbling refined warpstone. Over the top of these vats are suspended dangerous gangways from which Skavenslaves pour in more Warpstone and other alchemical reagents. The entire chamber is illuminated by the inky viridian light from the vats. The place is uncomfortably hot.</p>\n<p>Leaks are common from the bronze lined tanks, with caustic green fluid dribbling from rivets, and occasionally spurting the searing hot alchemical mix from a fresh hole, maiming or killing anyone nearby. When a vat is ready, slaves siphon the liquid into a tank and carry it to the base of the cannon. The presence of so many large vats makes it much easier to sneak past any Skaven in this room, or even scale a ladder to drop something into the fuel.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>CHEMICAL BURN!</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Warpfuel, if it lands on flesh, is corrosive and corrupting. A Character passing the storage tanks has a 10% chance of being sprayed by the mutating fluid. If this happens, a Character has to make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Dodge</strong> Test to avoid getting hit. Those struck by the fluid suffer [[/r 1D10+2 # Wounds]] Wounds, modified by Toughness Bonus and Armour Points, to a minimum of 1. A shield can block the spray, just as like any incoming attack. Those wounded by the Warpfuel also have @Corruption[moderate]{Moderate Exposure to Corruption}, and must test to see if they gain Corruption Points.</em></p>\n<p><em>Falling into a vat of Warpfuel is death for anyone. For antagonists we can assume they perish, screaming, as they melt away until nothing is left. For adventurers, it’s a Fate point.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>The Moonbreaker Emplacement</h4>\n<p>At the bottom of a void hacked from the mountain by the Skaven is the Moonbreaker’s base. Two large tanks filled with hundreds of gallons of Warpfuel sit under the cannon, emitting a deathly glow. A small group of Clan Skryre clanrats in full protective gear swarm around the device, scrutinising gauges, fixing copper protrusions and checking Warpfuel levels. They’re all busy, but any attempt at sabotage requires a distraction.</p>\n<p>The gun itself towers above, pointing out of the mountain’s peak, apparently an ancient volcanic caldera, towards the night sky. It is a tapered metal cylinder made from bronze and roughly 180-ft long. The surface of the barrel is etched with Skaven runes and covered with a bewildering tangle of beams, pipes, chains, bolts, plates, and levers. Makeshift wooden steps lead out of the gun chamber up to @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Maliss Manrack’s} lair.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/in-karak-skygg1.webp","folder":"DTYjZfJMc8xgYikO","sort":225000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Locations","sort":225000}}}

It can only be earned through long years of service to one’s hold, and the very idea of selling such an artifact is almost enough to make a self-respecting dwarf take the Slayer’s Oath and seek repentance in death at the hands of a worthy enemy. It is very rarely found in the hands of non-Dwarfs, though it is sometimes given in return for some great service rendered to Dwarf-kind, or stolen. To be a thief of Gromril is to never know peace, for any Dwarf who heard of such a thing would not hesitate to slay the perpetrator on the spot, or at least right after they had handed over their loot.</p>\n<p>Those few non-Dwarfs who do carry weapons or armour made of the material are often expected to return it to the Dwarfs at some point in the future, typically after the passing of a number of generations that varies with the value of the gift and the scope of the favour done to dwarfkind. This seems like a terribly long time to most Humans, but to the Dwarfs, long lived and fastidious record keepers as they are, it is quite reasonable. Many a scion has, on the death of a beloved great uncle or grandparent, found a contingent of Dwarfs on their doorstep, politely but firmly requesting the return of a dusty blade or sturdy breastplate that they had long assumed a worthless antique or fragile decorative piece. </p>\n<h3>Gromril Armour</h3>\n<p>While any armour could in theory be made from Gromil and benefit from its unparallelled rigidity and durability, in practice it is mostly used to make plate. While any Dwarf will tell you that plate is the only armour worthy of being made from Gromril, some whisper that even Dwarf smiths balk at the idea of forging the notoriously difficult to work metal into the thousands of interconnected rings required by mail.</p>\n<p>Gromril armour functions as any other plate armour, but provides 3 AP. In addition to the excellent protection this affords, the wearer is immune to any Critical Wounds inflicted on them. Critical strikes become normal blows. The only exception to this is Critical Wounds caused by damage inflicted after the Character has already been reduced to 0 Wounds. </p>\n<h3>Gromril Weapons</h3>\n<p>Far more Gromril is forged into armour than into weapons, as the protection it affords makes other uses for it seem almost wasteful. However, it is sometimes forged into weaponry, both for its durability, but also because few materials take Dwarf Runes with the same ease as forged Gromril. These weapons are bound to become legendary, and indeed the Empire’s mighty Runefangs, badges of office to the Elector Counts, are just such artefacts.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><em>@Item[ywPFmaj2Vc2cC6DX]{Gudii's Shield}</em></h3>\n<h3><em>@Item[U9xToi5rHfY9qfnc]{Von Haffenhof's Sword}</em></h3>\n</blockquote>","folder":"9Mo7W1zVxC85yc5b","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Dwarf Ironbreakers","sort":0}}}

He will recognise it.’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘We cannot let the Purple Hand or the Low Kings find out we’re looking for him. I suggest starting with his home in Sudgarten. While he hasn’t been seen in days, you may learn something. Perhaps also consult with any criminal contacts you have, though spare me the details. Good luck!’</em></p>\n<h2>INVESTIGATIONS</h2>\n<p>Starting with @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Gottfried Jarmund’s} home, the Characters uncover leads that will eventually lead them through Middenheim’s criminal underworld to a small Shallyan chapel in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.06LuFlBESLckr28m]{Ostwald} where the former magister hides in fear.</p>\n<h3>Jarmund’s Home</h3>\n<p>The @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.9S51a44wvQCES1CR]{Sudgarten} house is a narrow, four-storey terraced house separated by cramped alleys from its neighbours. Solid and well-maintained, it projects bourgeois respectability. On an <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> test, Characters notice light coming from one of the rooms through the drawn curtains. A notice pinned to the door reads, ‘<em>Due to illness, all current clients are referred to the Worshipful Guild of Legalists to seek new counsel. — G. Jarmund, esq.’</em></p>\n<p>Knocking rouses the grumpy housekeeper, Hermina, who tells the characters that ‘<em>The Master is ill and under a doctor’s care, with strict instructions not to be disturbed. Now go away!’ </em>Flashing the warrant from @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} makes her far more cooperative.</p>\n<p>Once inside she explains, ‘<em>The Master asked me to say that, so that no one would know he had gone to court a married lady. He paid me a whole Crown for my trouble!’ </em>She does not, however, have any idea who the lady is or where he may have gone.</p>\n<p>Characters find nothing helpful in the search, until they come to Jarmund’s study on the top floor. The door is locked. Hermina does not have a key, @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Jarmund} having forbidden her to enter that room. Characters may pick the lock on a <strong>Difficult (–10) Pick Locks </strong>Test. Within are signs of a quick exit: desk drawers rifled, secret compartments exposed and empty. On the wall behind the desk, a safe lies open and empty, the painting that once concealed it tossed aside. Everything, it seems, was cleaned out.</p>\n<p>An <strong>Average (+20) Perception </strong>Test uncovers a desk diary Jarmund forgot to take with him. It is an ordinary daybook, in which he recorded his non-cult activities: appointments and incidental expenses. If someone with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write} Talent examines it, a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test notes regular donations over the last six months to a ‘SH. Chap.’ for 2 GC each. This is a clue to Jarmund’s connection to the chapel in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.06LuFlBESLckr28m]{Ostwald}. If asked about the book and entries, Hermina says that Jarmund had mentioned visiting a Shallyan chapel, but not which one. A Shallyan herself, she can, however, provide a list of chapels in the city.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>WHAT IF THEY  DON’T ASK HERMINA?</em></h3>\n<p><em>Players may not ask Hermina about the diary entries. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NLiFxv0nwWtwRzSX]{Temple of Shallya} can serve as an alternate resource, Sister Hildegund being all too happy to make them a list in return for a few shillings in the poor box.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>The Five Shrines of Shallya</h4>\n<p>Hermina supplies a list of five chapels, all staffed by Initiates.</p>\n<p><strong>The Church of the Blessed Tears</strong>, @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor}. Staffed most days by Brother Simon, this two-room church occupies what was once a candle shop, the space donated by the owner in his will. Brother Simon has never met Herr @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Jarmund}, but would the gentlemen and ladies care to contribute to the chapel’s good work? </p>\n<p><strong>Saint Agnete’s shrine</strong>, @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.t1vYezDY0dOlA2yQ]{Brotkopfs}. Staffed by Sister Else, this shrine at the base of a boarding house provides religious solace to locals, and also maintains a small fund for needy congregants. Supported by member donations, she would be happy for help, but she has never met @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Gottfried Jarmund}.</p>\n<p><strong>The Dove and Heart</strong>, @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.QYipS3tpaNBDgKsN]{Geldmund}. Sister Ermegart maintains this standalone chapel, which seems more of a social club for local wives than a place of prayer. She has met Herr @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Jarmund}, but he has never donated anything to them.</p>\n<p><strong>St Berta’s chapel</strong>, @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{The Wynd}. Built centuries ago by wealthy clothier donors when the district was much more fashionable, this small church has fallen into disrepair, but still boasts amazing fresco art of sheep shearing. Staffed by Brother Gerardus, who also operates a small first aid clinic here, St Berta’s has never received a visit from Jarmund.</p>\n<p><strong>Tears of the Lady chapel</strong>, @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.06LuFlBESLckr28m]{Ostwald}. In a neglected neighbourhood, this three-room storefront church serves the poorest of the poor. A former fencing operation put to better use, it is staffed by @Actor[9xgBPlydvQbSuDjU]{Sister Anais Nuhn}, a reformed gang member. It is also where @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Jarmund} has taken sanctuary, hiding in the basement. She denies knowing Jarmund, and attempts to turn any conversation to donations for the temple. A <strong>Hard (–20) Intuition </strong>Test reveals she is hiding something, but not what. </p>\n<h3>Favourite Haunts</h3>\n<p>Players may seek leads on @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Jarmund} at places he was known to frequent, such as @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.9S51a44wvQCES1CR]{Sudgarten} establishments, the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists}, and taverns in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.hDeFkdQZ2g2fT0it]{Freiburg} where law students gather. Most turn up publicly known information: working class and radical student groups see him as a hero for fighting the system, while the higher classes scorn him as a soft-on-crime showboater.</p>\n<p>One lead, however, is found at The Cat and Mouse, a tavern in southern @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.9S51a44wvQCES1CR]{Sudgarten}. On an <strong>Average (+20) Gossip </strong>Test, the barkeep reveals @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Jarmund} was there a few days ago talking with @Actor[D17cqCKU6D4AzdPI]{Alfric ‘Half-Nose’ Anvilbreaker}, a ‘professional gossip’ who frequents the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NUXlJY1IPwZJzDvO]{Bretonnian House} in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}. Jarmund seemed anxious, though the barman doesn’t know what they talked about.</p>\n<h3>But Which Low King Has Him?</h3>\n<p>Characters must discover which Low King is holding @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Gottfried Jarmund}. But, approaching a Low King or their lieutenants directly would be indiscreet, as well as dangerous. A safer approach is to talk to people who know things and are willing to share — for a price. If they haven’t already heard of @Actor[D17cqCKU6D4AzdPI]{Alfric ‘Half-Nose’}, they can be pointed in his direction by speaking to anyone in a tavern about Underworld contacts and passing an <strong>Easy (+40) Gossip </strong>Test. NPCs such as @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.TzaVSnit9PuTukEo]{Karl Matthaus} or Josef can also recommend Alfric.</p>\n<h4>Half-Nose</h4>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NUXlJY1IPwZJzDvO]{Bretonnian House Inn} squats in the middle of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}, between the territories of Low Kings @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.gy8z3RbyyEKaoJ2e]{Bleyden} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.pB1MDVRBRyJTptne]{Edam Gouda}. It is owned by the landlord Jaques Henri (he pronounces it ‘Jacks Henry’), who speaks limited Bretonnian in a broad Altdorf accent. The inn is dingy and smells of stale cabbage, like everything inside. It is easy to pick out @Actor[D17cqCKU6D4AzdPI]{Alfric’s} mutilated face at a table in a quiet corner. A round of drinks buys his leave to have a seat, but Alfric expects money in return for information. He answers the Characters’ questions only after being paid for each question asked. Even if he doesn’t know or answers ‘no’ he still demands payment — knowledge of his ignorance is still knowledge, after all.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/alfric-anvilbreaker.webp\" width=\"305\" height=\"274\" /></div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[D17cqCKU6D4AzdPI]{Alfric ‘Half-Nose’ Anvilbreaker}</div>\n<h4>The Low Kings?</h4>\n<p>Alfric summarises what is generally known (@Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.vcw9pxNsMoxkTbRV]{The Low Kings}), explaining who each is, what territories they control, and their general reputations.

Offering 12 or more shillings gets him to admit, ‘<em> You ain’t heard this from me, got it? There’s been somethin’ odd going on at one of The Man’s safehouses: Number 33 Baumhafen Weg, in Westor. Now get lost.’</em></p>\n<h3>The Safe House</h3>\n<p>The @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.EwI0966tcHzz44lk]{Westor} safehouse sits quietly on a street of mostly terraced houses, some with shops on the ground floor. Three ‘minders’ quietly kept @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Jarmund} ‘company’, not attracting attention. Then one said something indiscreet, Gottfried realised the betrayal, and now the minders are dead, and Jarmund is gone.</p>\n<p>The place is an abandoned wreck. The top-floor rooms show signs of a struggle: blood on the walls and floors, broken glass and furniture. An <strong>Average (+20) Intuition, Perception, or Track </strong>Test by anyone with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent detects faint traces of the Winds Shyish, Ulgu, and Aqshy. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Magick)</strong> check confirms this is Tzeentch magic. In the bedroom is a hurriedly drawn and bloody summoning octagram. (Discovering the betrayal, Jarmund conducted a hasty ritual and used his own blood to summon a daemon to eat his captors alive. He then fled into the night.)</p>\n<p>Questioning neighbours will find one who witnessed the aftermath. <em>‘Terrible screams I heard, and then this fella dashes out and goes running off toward Ostwald like a daemon itself was chasing him.’</em></p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to the Characters, the house has been under observation since the incident by @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{The Man}, in case a lead to @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Jarmund} turned up.

{"_id":"8tDTYqHqATBx5tyt","name":"Encounters","content":"<p>While monsters are relatively common in the Middle Mountains, encounters of other kinds are rare — but not unknown. Here are a few possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Monster Hunters</h3>\n<p>When an area becomes famous — or notorious — for monsters, it will inevitably begin to attract monster hunters. These tend to fall into one of three categories:</p>\n<h4>Young Nobles</h4>\n<p>Although war is brewing in the Empire, it has not yet broken out into open conflict — which means that a young noble who wants to prove his or her mettle has only two options. The first is to enter wearisome service with a mercenary company, and place oneself under the command of a seasoned but ill-bred captain who has no respect for quality of breeding. The second — and, to many, more attractive — option is to assemble a stout band of lackeys, and set off into the wilds in search of big game.</p>\n<p>A noble expedition will consist of 1–4 nobles and 20–30 servants, hunters, scouts, and cart drivers, plus a cook or two, and about half a dozen guards. They will have a dozen or more carts loaded down with grand tents, vintage wines, and various other equipment and supplies — and perhaps a few monster heads and other trophies.</p>\n<h4>Scholars and Wizards</h4>\n<p>The study of monsters is a matter of great import in the Old World. Every great university has a Department of Bestiaria devoted to the study of the strange and unusual creatures found in wild and Chaos-warped places. Wizards, too — and not just those of the Amber Order — study these creatures to learn how they came into existence, what dangers they pose, and, in some cases, what magical and alchemical uses their various body parts can offer.</p>\n<p>An academic expedition will be led by 1–4 scholars or wizards, but will otherwise look very similar to a noble expedition.</p>\n<h4>Postulants and Penitents</h4>\n<p>The followers of many deities may come to the mountains in search of monsters. Some may be performing a penance, others may be fulfilling a vow made in exchange for a prior Blessing or Miracle, and others still may be proving themselves in order to win advancement.</p>\n<p>Followers of Ulric, for example, conduct ritual wolf hunts as part of their devotions, and the more fierce and devout among them may decide to slay some other kind of beast. Followers of Sigmar — especially witch hunters and flagellants, or those who wish to enter those careers — may follow rumours of Chaos beasts in the mountains, and seek to please their patron by slaying them. Even followers of gentle Shallya may embark on a monster hunt occasionally, if an elusive beast is threatening an innocent village.</p>\n<p>Penitence is not restricted to the religious. Dwarf Slayers regularly seek out the most dangerous monsters in the most treacherous terrain, so the Middle Mountains will offer them many attractions — not least of which is the chance to reach the Keep of the First Slayer, and perhaps be accepted into the elite Brothers of Grimnir. Nor is shame the sole province of the Dwarfs: members of other races may take to the mountains trying to forget, or court danger in the hope of laying to rest a shameful memory when cowardice or panic overcame them.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their backgrounds and motivations, these monster hunters may be encountered singly or in groups of up to a dozen. Occasionally a religious expedition with a charismatic leader may take on the proportions of a small crusade, gathering numbers at every stop along the way.</p>\n<h3>Escapees</h3>\n<p>The Middenland Mining Colony and Penitentiary (see above) is a harsh place, and although the mountains are arguably more dangerous still, there will always be those who prize their freedom above all things, and are prepared to risk death rather than give it up. Some simply want to escape, but others may have more complex motives: revenge on those who helped convict them; determination to prove their innocence; or even the desire to reach some hidden loot before the rest of the gang does.</p>\n<p>Escapees seldom last long in the mountains, but they may occasionally be encountered in groups of 1–6. They are ragged in appearance, gaunt and pale from a prison diet and hard work away from the light. Unlike other travellers in the mountains, they carry little or no equipment, and have only stolen or improvised weapons.</p>\n<p>Most escapees will try to avoid being seen, taking cover whenever they see someone else and either waiting for the strangers to leave, or trying to sneak away under the cover of the rough terrain. A few, the bravest and most desperate, may attempt to shadow a party of travellers, waiting for an opportunity to sneak into their camp at the dead of night and make off with whatever food and equipment they can.</p>\n<p>There is a standing reward for recapturing escapees, payable in any Road Warden post throughout Middenland. It varies with the severity of the prisoner’s sentence — and the honesty of the Road Warden paying it — but is generally between 5 GC and 50 GC.</p>\n<h3>Prospectors</h3>\n<p>Despite the well-known reputation of the Middle Mountains for being barren of mineral wealth, there will always be a few who come into the mountains hoping to find a previously unknown seam of gold or silver, or a pipe of precious gems, tucked away in some unexplored corner. Many are simply stubborn dreamers; a few have crackpot theories or untried ‘infallible techniques’ for finding the wealth that has eluded so many for so long; some are following visions they believe are prophetic signs of divine favour; and some, inevitably, have been sold bogus mining claims or spurious maps by some opportunist like the one who began the gold rush of 2479 (see @JournalEntry[ZPv7FvDayxPdZ9Gj]{A Guide to the Middle Mountains}).</p>\n<p>Prospectors generally travel in groups of 1–6. Those who know the Middle Mountains travel in larger numbers. Each prospector rides a tough mountain pony, and leads a string of 3–4 donkeys or mules laden down with tents, picks, supplies, and other equipment.</p>\n<h3>Hermits</h3>\n<p>Among the religious-minded, there has always been a devout minority who decide to turn their backs on the world and contemplate their own particular version of the infinite in a remote place far from the distractions of the flesh. Some go further and seek out the remotest and most uncomfortable places they can, punishing their flesh to purify their souls and focus their thoughts on the sacred.</p>\n<p>For many Middenlanders and Ostlanders, the Middle Mountains are the remotest and most uncomfortable place conveniently to hand, and here and there one may find the crude and cheerless stone huts of such ascetics, the shrines they build by the side of the track, and sometimes the hermits themselves. Occasionally, the buildings are intact, the shrines undefiled, and the hermits still breathing.</p>\n<p>While many hermits prefer solitude, some gather in small communities of up to a dozen individuals. When contemplating the sins and follies of the world, after all, it is pleasant to have someone to share in the judgments and condemnations. Some hermits may ignore passers-by, or even try to chase them away with pious invective, while others may be more friendly — especially to co-religionists who can prove, or feign, an equally impressive level of devotion. In a pinch, they might be prevailed upon to pray for Blessings or Miracles, or to provide basic first aid: some hermits are familiar with local herbs and their properties.</p>\n<p>The rarest type of hermit is one of such pure heart and unswerving piety that their mere presence is sufficient to sanctify a patch of land around a cell or shrine. Within a radius of 30 yards or less, the landscape is miraculously changed: barren rock gives way to lush grass; sleet-grey skies to pure, cloudless blue; and twisted, stunted trees to bountiful groves of fruit set around a crystal spring. Monsters (and Characters carrying too many Sin points) are physically unable to cross into the sanctified area, or suffer pain and Wounds as if from one @Condition[Ablaze] Condition until they leave. Resting here doubles the normal rate of healing, and gives a +20 bonus to all associated Tests.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/ingrid-sasslewort.webp\" width=\"247\" height=\"354\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[26K0UVfAPCxZyLyO]{Ingrid Sasslewort}</p>\n<h3>Followers of Chaos</h3>\n<p>While hermits seek to get away from the sins of the world, followers of Chaos (and occasionally of other forbidden paths such as those of Necromancy or Daemonology) may take to the mountains in search of a place where their own sins do not attract witch hunters or angry mobs.</p>\n<p>Although they are much rarer in the Middle Mountains than they are in legends and nursery tales, the lairs of evil wizards and other followers of Chaos can occasionally be found. Many of these individuals will try to hide their true nature when faced with a party of adventurers like the Characters. They may try to imprison or even murder the Characters for use in some unspeakable experiments, or simply to prevent the word of their presence from getting out.</p>\n<p>In order to win the Characters’ trust and explain their presence in such a remote and monster-haunted place with a small retinue of guards and servants (most if not all of whom are actually apprentices, cultists, or both), they may claim to be robber barons or even chartered nobles, armed with a (forged) commission from some Elector or other to pacify the area in exchange for being recognised as its lord.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have already encountered or even heard of a holy hermit of the type described in the previous section, a cruel GM might decide to have them encounter a powerful sorcerer of Tzeentch, whose Chaotic magics transform a patch of land so that it appears to be sanctified in just the same way — but being the work of Chaos, of course, its effects will be very different.</p>\n<h3>Bandits</h3>\n<p>The threat posed by bandits or outlaws is the most mundane of all hazards in a wild area like this. Because they rely on a supply of victims to relieve of their food and valuables, these bandits and outlaws will seldom make their base too far away from a reasonably well-used route. This makes the base more vulnerable to punitive raids by the local authorities, of course, so it will generally be well hidden, using an intimate knowledge of the local terrain and whatever mundane and magical means can be deployed to help disguise it.</p>","folder":"JTeIyCtQuF0ycF4v","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"A Guide to the Middle Mountains","sort":200000}}}

It provides a guide to the most important locations and what the party may find there. </p>\n<p>Should they choose to explore the full extent of the Dwarf halls, they may spend a lot of time looking at dusty chambers that were stripped and abandoned thousands of years ago. If they stray too far from the main locations, have the bell toll to remind them of the urgency of their mission, or put a solid stone Dwarf blockade in their way — the legacy of the inhabitants who sealed Karak Skygg supposedly forever.</p>\n<h3>Encounters</h3>\n<p>The main tunnels and chambers of Karak Skygg are busy, with packs of slaves, Clan Skryre clanrats and warriors, and even some Yellow Fang cultists bustling about. Rats are everywhere, gnawing on suspicious lumps of gristle, fighting and slinking in and out of cracks in the walls. Most corridors are dimly lit with the occasional torch or bundle of burning rags shoved into a wall sconce. </p>\n<p>As the Characters explore the Hold, you can use the following table to provide atmosphere. If the party acts suspiciously, they may be challenged by any Skaven they meet.</p>\n<p>Most of the Skaven are preoccupied with the work at hand, and are so used to seeing man-things and other slaves that they will not give the Characters a second glance as long as they have no reason to suspect that they are intruders. The Characters may have to make <strong>Stealth</strong> or <strong>Entertain (Acting)</strong> Tests from time to time, but if no alarm has been raised, all Tests to avoid notice or allay suspicions are <strong>Average (+20)</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Bluff</h4>\n<p>If challenged by a lone Skaven or a small group of guards, the Characters can try to convince the Ratmen that they are a part of the great project. So many Skaven are involved, that none could possibly know this isn’t true.</p>\n<p>For a group that enjoys roleplaying and negotiation, this option offers a great deal of entertainment. <strong>Charm </strong>Tests will be necessary, modified by a number of factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what the Characters were doing to arouse suspicion</li>\n<li>the effectiveness (or otherwise) of any disguises</li>\n<li>the success or failure of any <strong>Entertain (Acting)</strong> Tests made in the effort to look like they belong</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These Charm Tests will be opposed by the Cool or Willpower of the challenging party, which can be taken from the appropriate profile.</p>\n<p>A successful Test will send the challenger away, giving the Characters time to finish what they were doing and get out of the area.</p>\n<h4>Fight!</h4>\n<p>If the Characters are foolish or unlucky and a fight seems inevitable, they may be able to subdue their opponents without raising the alarm or attracting attention. For every Round of combat, there is a 15% chance some more Skaven happen across them. Roll on the encounter table above to see what happens.</p>\n<h4>Run!</h4>\n<p>The party may also try to flee, losing themselves in the mass of Skaven and slaves before a pursuit can be organised.</p>\n<p>To make good their escape, each of the Characters should make an Extended Average (+10) Stealth Test with a total of 5 SLs required. Chapter 4 of Power Behind the Throne includes detailed rules for chases and shadowing in the crowded streets of Middenheim’s Carnival week, which can be used to add detail to the process: each Round with no movement imposes a cumulative –10 penalty on the next Round’s Test.</p>\n<h4>Captured!</h4>\n<p>If everything goes wrong, the consequences depend on where the party is captured and what they were doing.</p>\n<p><strong>If they are on the 3rd or 4th stratum or engaged in sabotage</strong>, they are taken to Maliss for interrogation.</p>\n<p><strong>If they are disguised as slaves or on any other level</strong>, they are taken to the Slave Pens and thrown into a cage which happens to contain @Actor[t332rbwPtP1GMkmy]{Hetri Bittercrag}.</p>\n<p>@Actor[B0rOVyG0wgVoVA6z]{Brokenclaw}, the Skaven spy, can be encountered anywhere in Karak Skygg — you can deploy him if the party is doing something suspicious and they could use additional help.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-gibbet.webp\" width=\"244\" height=\"289\" /></div>\n<h2>Locations</h2>\n<p>Karak Skygg can be considered as a stack of four layered ‘strata’, each consisting of several floors with similar functions.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[snXwUXGU95RdgkxP]{Below Earth}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[p3NPc0GWlUN3o8vt]{The First Stratum — Halls of Valaya}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[aLnkS8QcTYXWLapv]{The Second Stratum — Axe Halls}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[5hlq3xE8w3btQyjP]{The Third Stratum — The Forges}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[u48Nkp90hgkmWpl2]{The Fourth Stratum — The Peaks}</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/in-karak-skygg2.webp\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/in-karak-skygg2.webp","folder":"AB2bLgqo3QiAniTe","sort":-200000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Karak Skygg","sort":-200000}}}

{"_id":"9zoINZXWOUAQb5NY","name":"The Skaven","content":"<p>Skaven are a secretive species of ratmen who inhabit a vast Under-Empire beneath the world’s surface. Most folk in the Empire dismiss them as tales to frighten children into cleaning behind their ears. <em>‘If you don’t stop your whining and wash up, the rat-men will think you’re one of their stinking little pups and steal you away!’</em> But the Skaven are real, and ever-present.</p>\n<h3>Appearance</h3>\n<p>An average full-grown Skaven stands between 4-6 ft tall. Their short fur is mangy, patched, and soiled with filth, their hides scarred from constant, violent squabbles. Their faces are frothing snouts filled with yellow fangs. Their beady, blood-coloured eyes simmer with malice. Their wiry limbs terminate in scrabbling claws, stained by filth. A long, sinuous tail lashes behind them with ever-present anxiety. Their stench is a gag-inducing reek of hot sewage and animalistic musk that lingers beyond their passing.</p>\n<p>Skaven make nothing of quality. They produce urine-tanned hide and rust-pocked metal; each piece cast off, repurposed, or forged in decaying workshops. Most wear icons of their clan, either carved into their equipment, branded upon their flesh, or dyed into their fur with pigments derived from blood and effluvia.</p>\n<h3>Society </h3>\n<p>The putrid centre of Skavendom’s power lies sinking into the Blighted Marshes. The ruined towers of Skavenblight rise above the murk. A great horned bell hangs at the towering apex of the greatest spire, its dolorous toll echoing out across the wetlands.</p>\n<p>Beneath the ruins, a complex web of tunnels stretches out across the known and unknown world — running under mountains and oceans to link hidden Skaven lairs on every continent. It is said that if you know the way, you can follow these twisted warrens to reach anywhere that civilisation has ever thrived, as the Skaven are driven to eternally gnaw at the roots of mortal endeavours.</p>\n<p>Skaven thrive in tunnels and ruins in a brutal and strictly hierarchical structure. At the bottom are slaves. These gangs of miserable souls are forced to undertake dangerous menial labour, farming mutated crops and endlessly mining. The lives of Skavenslaves are nightmarish and short.</p>\n<p>The Warlord Clans are teeming masses of warrior Skaven. @Actor[u66iYrXRTW15bkTI]{Clan Mors} and @JournalEntry[WB26MGDboQXbFKgS]{Clan Rictus} are hugely successful Warlord Clans who possess great prestige. @JournalEntry[x2P2J3fqNcP3EH7P]{Clan Mange} are a lesser Warlord Clan.</p>\n<p>Four clans are particularly powerful and wealthy, originators of technologies or techniques in high demand throughout Skavendom. They are the Great Clans. @JournalEntry[GDJrTdC0a8HHqyr8]{Clan Moulder} breed nightmarish abominations, such as Rat Ogres who make hulking bodyguards or terrifying shock troops. @JournalEntry[XzJenEYTArBENmQA]{Clan Eshin} are experts of infiltration and assassination who hire out their services to the other clans and eliminate targets with lethal efficiency. @JournalEntry[QcVM1YRuOEjblPll]{Clan Pestilens} are frothing zealots who drag their diseased bodies through the Under-Empire, spreading corruption and plagues. @JournalEntry[OAmYmBoQ6Eld7CBb]{Clan Skryre} are mad engineers who use a nightmarish combination of sorcerous power and warpstone technology to forge terrifying technologies of unparalleled destructive power. @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack} is a Master Warlock of Clan Skryre. </p>\n<p>The Council of Thirteen sits at the height of Skaven society. It comprises twelve Skaven, with the thirteenth seat symbolically held by the Great Horned Rat himself. They are terrifying creatures. Each was hand-picked by the Skaven god to rule, and each is a centuries-old monster of conniving spite, driven by the desire to best their rival Lords and dominate the world.</p>\n<h3>Warpstone </h3>\n<p>Warpstone is prized by Skaven. It fuels their economy, technology, sorcery, and even extends their lifespans — if prepared and consumed carefully. This hard, crystalline substance resembles hard-chipped obsidian that glows with a sickly-green light that plays along its glassy surface and refracts within its depths. (See @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.hGeXud7E91sHnz0w]{Magic Rules}) Magical scholars postulate that this accursed material enters the world through Chaos gates, and is formed when magical energy concentrates and stagnates, solidifying into a raw form of Chaos. Many suppose that the smaller of the world’s two moons, Morrslieb, is made entirely from Warpstone.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/skaven.webp\" width=\"378\" height=\"301\" /></div>\n<h2>Skaven Troops</h2>\n<p>Throughout the adventure certain types of Skaven may be encountered again and again.

While this adventure can be played on its own, it has been designed to be played after completing volume 3, Power Behind the Throne. This book contains everything you need to play the adventure (except for the <strong>WFRP </strong>4th edition rulebook), as well as detailed information on the infamous Skaven.</p>\n<p>A dreadful crisis has been narrowly averted in the City State of Middenheim. Boris Todbringer, the Graf, has not been well of late, suffering a profound melancholy following the death of his second wife, Anika-Elise of Nordland. </p>\n<p>Law Lord @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier} sought to take advantage of the Graf ’s lassitude, and his schemes have been narrowly averted. He wished to undermine confidence in the leadership of the city through the imposition of harsh taxes on Dwarfs, Priests, and Wizards. His plan was to replace the Graf of Middenheim with a shapeshifting Doppelgänger under his control, rescind the taxes (which he had always been careful to publicly oppose), and rule Middenheim as a power behind the throne. The web of lies, blackmail, extortion, and hypnotism he created in order to bring his plan to fruition has led to many of the city’s worthies becoming deeply compromised.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Wasmeier, a group of adventurers had stumbled across the secret society he was a member of: the Tzeentch-worshipping Purple Hand. They foiled his plans and he narrowly escaped with his life. He is currently licking his wounds, figuring out how he might once again rise to prominence in a cult that must surely now regard him as a bumbling failure.</p>\n<p>In Middenheim, Wasmeier’s lieutenants scramble to find protection, convinced Sergeants of the Watch will soon be knocking on their door. During the process of its scheming, the Purple Hand had employed the services of @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit}, a Skaven with a talent for abductions.

At the beginning there are a number of strange things occurring in Middenheim, and members of the Purple Hand reacting to the disappearance of @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}. All these require investigation, but the order in which to do so is up to the GM and players. As the Characters pursue their investigations they uncover evidence to help them convince Middenheim’s citizens that the Skaven threat is real and serious.

It commemorates Pendrag, a lifelong friend and sword-brother of Sigmar who dwelled in Middenheim for many years — some Sigmarites claim he was first count of Middenheim, but never in earshot of an Ulrican.</em></p>\n<p><em>During the Time of Three Emperors, when anti-Sigmar sentiment in the city ran high, the shrine was all but abandoned. Eventually the door was bricked up, new buildings were built above and around it and the shrine was forgotten. The Purple Hand discovered the location and secretly opened up access from an adjacent storehouse. Now it’s used as a secret meeting place for the cult or to keep captives destined for sacrifice. Erich Kalzbad is hiding here while he makes preparations to leave the city.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The party should eventually confront @Actor[WkrLGgu5qPHzUFiB]{Kalzbad} at the Shrine. Depending on the time of day, you could decide he is elsewhere — in which case they find his belongings and can prepare an ambush.</p>\n<p>Begleitersallee is a dingy terraced backstreet where poor workers live. The purple door is halfway down on the lowest terrace. Behind it is a draughty room with bales of mouldering cloth stacked against one wall. An <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test reveals that the dust around the cloth has been disturbed. Behind the bales is an unlocked wooden door leading into the forgotten shrine.</p>\n<h3>Layout</h3>\n<p><strong>The Shrine</strong>: This is a windowless stone-walled room lit by candles. There is a plain stone altar and two worn statues of Pendrag and Sigmar. Pendrag is holding aloft a sword. Sigmar is wearing the Crown of Sorcery he took from Brass Keep. Both statues have a purple hand print across their faces. There are bloodstains on the altar. The walls are scrawled with nonsensical Tzeentchian screeds written in Dark Tongue. The original entrance is bricked up.</p>\n<p><strong>Antechamber</strong>: This was once a storage room for candles and shrine furniture. It is now a makeshift camp for @Actor[WkrLGgu5qPHzUFiB]{Kalzbad}, who has placed a bedroll, small mirror and wooden crate to make it more homely. There are several bags of travel belongings and some of his papers.</p>\n<p>There are four @Actor[ANzpkMJEsl7rNMLe]{Red Shield bodyguards} here at any time, one of them stands at the front of the purple door, another within the store room. The remaining two position themselves behind first story windows at either side of the alleyway, ready to shoot at troublemakers. They can be spotted lurking in the darkness by anyone passing at <strong>Hard (–10) Perception</strong> Test. @Actor[WkrLGgu5qPHzUFiB]{Kalzbad} and his Red Shield bodyguards attack anyone who enters. He shouts, <em>‘Did Bahr send you? Or was it Jarmund?’ </em>If the Liebering lookalike is here, he’ll add <em>‘And you, Lieberung! Such exalted ambition! But our brothers in Altdorf will see through it!’</em></p>\n<p>After a round of combat, the Magister throws open his doublet to reveal a hideous elongated third arm ending in a gaping, toothless orifice. A gout of blue flame bursts from the end and spreads across the floor.</p>\n<p>Other than Kalzbad, everyone in the Devotional Room takes [[/r 1d10 # Damage]] Damage modified by Toughness Bonus and Armour Points. The conflagration instantly coalesces into a number of animated flames, one for every two members of the party. The flames tumble towards the Characters, writhing with malevolent, mocking mouths.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[WkrLGgu5qPHzUFiB]{Kalzbad} is defeated but not killed, he bellows words in Dark Tongue ‘<em>Skrrch’tzen khur’na!’ </em>and turns his flamer arm on himself.

Others reflect the events of Power Behind the Throne, albeit in a slightly garbled, hearsay form, and others still add snippets of information that advance the plot of this adventure. Where necessary, the GM may fill in any missing details from previous stories, if the Characters somehow failed to pick up the relevant information in earlier rumours.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>‘Do you remember the early days of the reign of Karl-Franz first of his name? People had such hopes didn’t they? Here was a man of stature, bloodied in combat, son to an Imperial line who had mostly proved good statesmen, and promoters of Imperial unity. But over the last year or so he seems a different man. What’s he doing to put an end to the violence between Ulrican zealots and Sigmarite fanatics? Nothing. And he’s saying mutants ought to be legal citizens? They’re damned to fall to forces I won’t be so reckless as to even mention! He’s meant to embody our nation’s Defiance of the Dark! I reckon he’s out of his wits, but the Empire keeps running. Someone must be pulling the strings and they’re up to no good, trying to turn north and south against each other and doing who knows what else besides.’<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>‘The Emperor has been put out of the way by the Grand Theogonist, who now has a free hand to persecute other faiths, and turn the Empire into his own theocratic tyranny in the name of Sigmar. Informants are divided as to the means used: some believe he infected the Emperor with some kind of magical illness; while others claim that the Emperor was mutated: the cult of Sigmar has always been in league with Chaos, you know!’<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>‘Things are getting worse between Talabecland and Ostland. Both sides have mustered their armies and begun hiring mercenaries. The renowned Baumann’s Blitztruppen left Middenheim just a few days ago, having recruited a lot of new bodies during the Carnival. No one knows yet which side Baumann will join; it is thought that he will see which Elector makes the better offer.’<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>‘I heard something odd the other day. Apparently, despite all the disorder within our borders, a campaign has been arranged in conjunction with the Margrave of Parravon to quest into the grey Mountains and besiege Blood Keep. That this foul Necromancer’s nest has stood upon our borders for so long without answer is a disgrace, but at last it seems someone is doing something about it, and they’ve brought the Bretonnians in to help. Wonderful!’<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>‘There’s trouble brewing up north of here. Baron Nikse has governed Nordland in the style of his forebears, which means he does what the Todbringers tell him to do, and all the better for it. Now some upstart count by the name of Theodric Gausser is stirring up trouble. The Guassers once ruled an independent Nordland, you see, in days before Middenheim extended her benevolent protection, and this Theodric is pretending to those in Altdorf that he’s effectively taken over from the Nikses, and, therefore, the Graf. It’d be just like those cloth-headed Altdorfers to believe such piffle too.’<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>‘The Sigmarite monastery at Priestlicheim, near the Barren Hills, was attacked recently. All the monks were slaughtered and the place was ransacked. Priestlicheim is on the southern bank of the Talabec, just across the river from Middenland, and the Grand Duke suspects the Sons of Ulric. Is the Graf going to side with Ostland in the dispute between the two provinces?’ </em><br /><br />A current or former priest of Sigmar may make an Intelligence Test to remember that the Priestlicheim monastery — known as the Temple of Leopold — was founded to study the Barren Hills and determine what afflicts the land there. Characters may already know that the land was affected by a shower of Warpstone meteorites. The Players may not put two and two together immediately, but later in the adventure they will realise that the Skaven have been stealing research and searching for clues that might lead to more warpstone.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>‘Tensions are rising between the Reikland and Talabecland, which is already on the verge of war with Ostland. An Imperial signal tower, under construction on the banks of the Reik, just south of Castle Reikguard, has been attacked several times in recent weeks. This Dwarf Engineer, Aynjulls Isembeard, and the rest of her building crew finally abandoned the project after another attack three days ago. My dyspeptic old aunt reckons it was agents of the Grand Duke of Talabecland disgused with magic what did it, and she knows a thing or two. His way of telling the Emperor to stay out of the Ostland–Talabecland dispute.’</em><br /><br />Dwarf Characters may be outraged by this assertion, which impugns Dwarf honesty, courage, and good sense in the most insulting way. The Characters should know that this is the signal tower where they found the library of Dagmar von Wittgenstein. The most recent attack was by a group of Skaven sent to recover Dagmar’s remaining books, as the Characters discover elsewhere in this adventure.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-animal-skull.webp\" width=\"189\" height=\"220\" /></div>","folder":"qPSOCqWeY1xLP2vT","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Road East","sort":0}}}

If the Characters explain they are seeking a Ranaldan who’s been pulling a string of burglaries, and treat the old man with respect, he confesses he hasn’t heard of such a person, but, if they agree to put in a good word for him with the cult, he can give them a pointer.<em> ‘Were I lookin’ for thievin’ magpie, I’d see Gilbertus at Luigi and Salvatore’s, or ask around</em> The Fifth Finger.’</p>\n<h4>Pity Square, Sudgarten</h4>\n<p>Characters with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.r180vP86SlwyJc8W]{Criminal} talent or Lore (Middenheim) will know of the notice board at @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.z1B4bAaP1oe99Qo5]{Pity Square}, near Sister Hildegarde’s Well.

They want to send a message to Maliss — this is our territory, beg forgiveness or we will starve and kill your agents.</p>\n<p>Under-Middenheim is deep beneath the Fauschlag, but the Skaven have carved tunnels into the Undercity for when they need to encroach on the man-things’ city. @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit} and his band used these tunnels, and the agents of @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack} have followed. A full regiment of Clan Mange Clanrats were sent to the city to capture slaves and take hostages and artefacts desired by Maliss. This was the final straw for @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Gnawretch Skrray}. He ordered Fangleader Hisskar and his Clan Scrutens Stormvermin to lure the pack to an access chamber and spring a trap, barricading them in to die. Now they are starving and succumbing to the Black Hunger, an affliction which drives Skaven to cannibalise one another in a desperate frenzy. When the party investigates certain peculiar phenomena around @JournalEntry[kJVOtXrZ4sL9NKwD]{Lachmann’s Quality Victuals} in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt}, they may discover the fate of the Mange pack, and learn more of the Skaven and the machinations of @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack}.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE BLACK HUNGER</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Skaven are constantly ravenous, enslaved by a fast metabolism that gives them a relentless need to eat. If denied sustenance for long enough, they weaken and soon go mad. In this state, Skaven enter a frenzy which overcomes their natural cautiousness and drives them to devour anything they can seize. All too often this is their own kin. In this wild state, they are blind to anything but their own hunger.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Clanrats of the Patchclaw pack are slowly succumbing to the Black Hunger in the dark below @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt}. They alternate between famished torpor and desperate frenzy, gnawing at their own limbs and tearing down their weakest fellows.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Investigations</h2>\n<p>There are several hooks into this scenario, which may come to light when investigating the Skaven:</p>\n<h3>The Ratters’ Guild</h3>\n<p>At the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.I86oiOppQimWvWaP]{Ratters’ Guild} the Characters may be received by either one of the two guild secretaries, Hauke Ayinger or Isaak Köstritzer. If they are received by Hauke (assuming he has not yet been unmasked as a member of the Yellow Fang) he will interrogate the Characters for any information that might be of use to the cult, but is not otherwise hostile. Asked about rats in the Altmarkt he is as helpful as his colleague as he does not connect this particular line of inquiry to Skaven activity. </p>\n<p>On the subject of a recent paucity of rats in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt} the Rat Catchers say that Jasper Lachmann has been complaining about the smell of dead vermin and squeaking in his walls, which is costing him business from the fancy inns that buy his stock. But when Rat Catcher Thal Bohnet went down there with his terrier, Furst, they found nothing, not a single mouse or rat. Altmarkt is the city’s main source of food, and for a property to contain no vermin is impossible. Bohnet and Furst are among the city’s best ratters, so nobody can explain it. </p>\n<p>The reason is simple. Rats have an innate aversion to the reek given off by Skaven suffering the Black Hunger. They are giving Lachmann’s a wide berth for fear of being next on the menu.</p>\n<h3>Fine Dining</h3>\n<p>If the party visits a high-end eatery (such as @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.jOgoeW03OTDSX2PP]{the Harvest Goose}, the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.IEjGO7UD5QfWsrV2]{Showboat} or the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.IF7r1tmPdjKOmKYZ]{Horse and Groom}) they are surprised to find the menu severely restricted. If they ask why venison, swan or wheels of Bretonnian soft cheese are not available, the proprietor apologises and explains that their usual supplier, Lachmann’s, was unable to provide ingredients of sufficient quality. If they enquire further, they are told that they take pride in serving only the finest quality ingredients and it seems Lachmann’s current stock is riddled with vermin. When the chef visited the warehouse earlier, the place stank of rats, and they could be heard writhing and squeaking below the floor.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>RUMOURS</em></h3>\n<p><em>The party can pick up gossip around Altmarkt from stallholders, grocers, and anyone else who likes spreading rumours about wealthy people.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>‘Have you heard? Old Lachmann’s going out of business! His whole place stinks of dead rats. About time, snooty old git.’</em><br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>‘I passed Lachmann’s yesterday and you could smell it — that sweet gamey smell you get with dead rats under the floor. By Sigmar, it was so strong.’</em><br /><br /></li>\n<li><em>‘You can hear them from the street, squealing and fighting. Nasty little buggers. But the rat catcher said there are none there!’</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/black-hunger.webp","folder":"iXB5QNNSLed8fMke","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Black Hunger","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"FNTjkqz8P8LFv3rL","name":"Instigating Events","content":"<p>If the Characters have not played <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, some initial set-up will be required to hook them into the main story. The story begins in Middenheim, a city to the north of the Empire famed for stoic attitudes, the worship of Ulric, the liberal rule of the Todbringer family, and its seat atop a flat mountain called the Fauschlag.</p>\n<p>A GM could start the adventure a day or two after the Carnival that almost saw the Purple Hand take control; everyone in Middenheim is back to their gruff selves, the only out-of-towners are either angry about missing the party, or stragglers bragging about all the fun the Characters missed. Every inn has out-of-date posters advertising all sorts of entertainment that the Characters <em>just missed</em>, from fire-breathing acrobats to knightly jousting to bare-knuckle boxing. People are still gossiping about how great this year’s Carnival was, how the Middenball final was the best in decades, or how funny it was when one of Barnumble’s Incredible Performing Elephants tossed a cabbage so hard at a posing Reikland fop that he was knocked into a heap of dung.</p>\n<p>The Characters have little knowledge of how the city almost fell to Chaos, but can learn the basics from asking around.</p>\n<h3>The Raid</h3>\n<p>This event is only necessary if the Characters have not already encountered @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit}, either by not playing through <strong>Power Behind the Throne </strong>or avoiding the event. It assumes the Characters are lodged at The @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.JAi2HLfYRkYwLC63]{Templar’s Arms} in Middenheim. It also assumes the Characters are experienced veterans who have completed the previous Enemy Within adventures. </p>\n<p>Officially the Empire denies the existence of Skaven. Of the few who know of them, most consider them enemies. A very few, however, find them useful. They possess great stealth, vast warrens of secret tunnels, and not a shred of morality, making them extremely competent spies, thieves, and assassins.</p>\n<p>@Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit} was a mercenary Skaven. He and his warband were a critical part of the Purple Hand’s plans to destabilise the Empire. They shot Crown Prince von Tasseninck and kidnapped Reya Ehrlich, @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.2T8CXsP45Z3Kptvi]{Law Lord Ehrlich’s} niece. But Snikkit was also working for Maliss Manrack, helping him steal items and abduct slaves from Middenheim. @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss} wishes to persuade his Clan Mange allies that @JournalEntry[12lvOI4wQSBD4Lvx]{Brass Keep}, a stronghold in the Middle Mountains, ought to be of interest to them, and he directed Snikkit to retrieve a map of Brass Keep from @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.JAi2HLfYRkYwLC63]{The Templar’s Arms}. Snikkit also decided to use the theft as an opportunity to indulge in summary slave raiding.</p>\n<p>Snikkit’s raid begins before dawn. The Characters are roused by shouting and screaming from the inn’s main barroom. Give them one minute to react before a pair of Skaven warriors burst through their door. This is enough time for them to grab weapons, cast spells, or don pieces of armour such as coifs, helmets or shields. Heavier armour is far too complicated to put on in time. The warband is currently split up, searching the inn in pairs to round up captives, so Characters can use this to their advantage and fight the Skaven band as small isolated groups.</p>\n<p>Everyone else in the inn has been dragged to the barroom and tied up. Those who put up a fight were killed outright to cow the others into compliance. @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit}, in the barroom, tears down an old map on the wall, rolls it up, and tucks it into his belt. If Characters are not present to witness this but the other hostages survive they can mention it. If there are no survivors, then call for an <strong>Average (+10) Perception </strong>Test. If failed, the Characters notice the missing map but can only recall it showed the western end of the Middle Mountains. If passed, they recall that it also marked the position of a fortress called Brass Keep.</p>\n<p>The warband consists of @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit} and six @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{Clanrats}. It is a volatile situation, and the Skaven are just as nervous as their prisoners. They could erupt into violence at so much as a dirty look. In a fight, the Skaven are cowardly and prefer to gang up on enemies. Snikkit, being their leader, directs them from behind, attacking only when he has the upper hand. If cornered he fights to the death. Otherwise, he tries to flee into the sewers and escape to the @JournalEntry[f26xUFqmgNP7KLEg]{Staging Post}.</p>\n<h3>CORNERED RATS</h3>\n<p>The Watch arrive in force ([[/br 2d10+2]] Watchmen, 2 Sergeants and a Captain, use the @JournalEntry[6peiEta3p0XPCSzU]{Sewer Jack} actor if they get involved in a fight) five minutes after the attack begins. This can be a little earlier if the Characters are clearly overwhelmed, or they can run into the Watch on their way if they choose to flee.</p>\n<p>The Captain takes the Characters’ names for a follow-up interview, commending them for saving the captives or for escaping to get help. They’ll send for a Priest of Morr to collect any dead guests or staff (this can be @JournalEntry[nAvIeCzTvTvMat4P]{Yergard} if the Characters wait to meet him), and for the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica} to collect any Skaven corpses for further study. If the Characters ask, they are told that Professor Eunice Hasche deals with unusual creatures. If the Characters wait around the two Collegium porters, @Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Karl Zeitenalter} and @Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Gaius Stummzunge}, arrive with a pushcart, pile the Skaven bodies on to it, and wheel them off to @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.jGfyLhox6OTD75oi]{Nordtor} and the Collegium. These members of the Yellow Fang are the cause of much mischief, though there is nothing to suggest here that Karl and Gaius are anything other than hardworking porters at this point.</p>\n<p>The following afternoon the Characters are summoned for questions by Watch Commander @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann}.</p>\n<h3>Meeting Watch Commander Schutzmann</h3>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/ulrich-schutzmann.webp\" width=\"257\" height=\"358\" /></div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann}</div>\n<p>The commander listens carefully to their account of the incident and offers congratulations. He is convinced that Skaven are just mutant freaks who occasionally crop up in the sewers of the Old World, and finds the idea that they could seriously threaten Middenheim preposterous. If the Characters are sincere, however, he dutifully records their statements. If they mention the map @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit} stole, or Brass Keep, he makes a note and tells them those lands are well beyond his jurisdiction, but that he will bring it to the Graf ’s attention. He then takes an appraising look at them and makes the following offer of employment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘By all accounts you handled yourselves well in last night’s attack, and after recent events my people are stretched thin. I have a list of investigations long as an Elven lifespan. Some I can’t spare the men for and others are in places where the sight of a uniform would cause trouble. Some dangerous work, I won’t lie, but you did well last night, and I can promise the payment will match the risk.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If asked about these recent events, @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} explains that there was a conspiracy involving @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Law Lord Wasmeier}, now a suspected Chaos Sorcerer and wanted man. Such a powerful public official turning traitor has the city in turmoil, and tensions were running high long before that. Schutzmann is suspicious that some of his men might have ties to Wasmeier’s cult or, even worse, to one or more of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.vcw9pxNsMoxkTbRV]{Middenheim’s Low Kings}, the bosses of the city’s underworld. As folks who are relatively new in town, he thinks the Characters should be free of such associations, and therefore better placed to perform the investigations he wishes to have carried out.</p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann’s} offer is this: provided they remain discreet, and as long as they are willing to help his investigations, he can provide the Characters with considerable resources. They can requisition whatever non-magical equipment, armour or weapons they might want. Schutzmann can arrange comfortable accommodation at one of Middenheim’s finer establishments, and they will receive a wage of one gold crown each per week, a very generous sum indeed.</p>\n<p>If the party has played <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, Schutzmann has already made them this offer (@Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.3sFdJskJYiLvUWkc]{Conclusion (Power Behind the Throne)}). They may still be working for him, or left to pursue their own goals, but are still near enough to Middenheim for a messenger to find them. Schutzmann has a high opinion of the Characters, especially if they saved the @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Graf} and exposed @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Law Lord Wasmeier}, and asks about any adventures they’ve had since they last spoke. </p>\n<p><strong>The Horned Rat</strong> truly begins with Schutzmann inviting the Characters to meet him at his public office, an outbuilding of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.Qh1UWMNBn18YNv1y]{State Army Barracks} by the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.asfdSFKUCr9gxFEG]{Square of Martials}. In the waiting room a representative of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.A6D8GCA2S0g8vw8K]{Dwarf Engineers’ Guild} is sitting in a chair, apparently deep in thought. If the Characters introduce themselves he is curt. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Modi Zargul of the Engineers’ Guild, here to speak with the Marshal and yourselves, but he’ll brief you first, so don’t natter, head inside and I’ll be speaking with you soon enough.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>YOU’RE BOOKED!</em></h3>\n<p><em>Schutzmann’s office is a small room lined with reports. Characters perusing his shelves can see </em>The Seventh Annual Report into Ostwald’s Organised Crime, A Log of Religious Unrest in Middenheim: 2509–2511, Suspected Aliases of The Man F-L, What Half-Nose Knows Half Of, Kärzburdger Influence over Ulrican Extremism, Criminal Rehabilitation — A Verenan Myth?, Gouda — The Wastelander Connection, The Greatest Caper of 1550 IC – What We Know, Suspected Aliases of The Man S-U,<em> and so on. </em></p>\n<p><em>These texts are dry justifications for Watch policy in Middenheim. However, scanning them provides information on the city’s Low Kings, notes on the information broker @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.UeS8v7lrTnfVSL0U]{Alfric Half-Nose}, that the theft of the Drakwald Runefang in 1550 IC is thought to be the work of Ranaldan burglars, and that the Kärzburdger family, who own estates to the east of Middenheim, have a long history of barely restrained hostility towards the Todbringers. These facts will be of use to Characters later in the investigation.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Schutzmann’s office, Characters passing a <strong>Hard (–10) Perception</strong> Test notice that on the desk are several plain but well-made books bound in goat leather, and inscribed with Dwarf runes. Characters who can read Khazalid see that they are discourses on how to construct cannons, crew cannons, fire cannons, and lay siege with cannons.</p>\n<p>Ulrich Schutzmann greets the Characters warmly. ‘<em>Good to see you. I trust that you have been recovering well from your exertions over Carnival week?’</em> This is an opportunity for Characters to ask any questions about the fallout from the events of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. Schutzmann will take the time to answer these questions, thanking the Characters again for their assistance, but he makes clear that there are fresh concerns.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Since the death of the former Law Lord, we have not been idle.  My best codebreakers have gone through Wasmeier’s papers, and we have several leads. Vestiges of this Purple Hand cult remain in Middenheim, and I mean to tear them out by the root. I expect that this is something you may be interested in assisting me with?’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is likely that veteran Characters will indeed wish to put an end to the Purple Hand in Middenheim, but if they seem reticent, Schutzmann is pragmatic, and explains that he has provisionally established a Komission. </p>\n<h2>THE KOMISSION</h2>\n<p>The Komission of Inquiry into Threats Unknown to Middenheim has been provisionally established by Schutzmann, and assigned a small budget that remains independent of the Watch. The purpose of the Komission, in Schutzmann’s view, is to investigate threats of the sort posed to the Graf. Whilst he is grateful for the Characters’ assistance, the very fact that unsolicited outside intervention was required to essentially save the Graf ’s life and the city’s independence is a matter of shame and concern. The Komission, called KITUM for short, seeks to address similar outlandish threats to the city.</p>\n<p>Schutzmann offers the Characters the opportunity to join the Komission, on a temporary basis, answering only to him and bearing his seal of authority to help with their investigations. </p>\n<p>He gives them each a warrant bearing his seal and identifying them as investigators. <em>‘ You can use these, if needed. But be discreet! Any mention of me, or of working for the Watch, risks alerting the wrong people — it’s likely that the Watch has been infiltrated by both the Purple Hand and the Low Kings.’</em></p>\n<p>Whilst he expects them to agree to a nominal payment in line with their status, he is a pragmatic man, and will pay up to 2 GC a week, if money seems to be a concern. As well as this the armouries of the Watch are made available to the Characters, though attempts to requisition things like plate armour or other expensive items will be refused on the grounds that Schutzmann expects the Characters to be <em>discreet</em>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>DODGING THE DRAFT</em></h3>\n<p><em>If the Characters seem unwilling to agree to joining the Komission on any terms, Schutzmann will enlist any of the NPCs from <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> with which the Characters developed a relationship to try to talk them around. If they still refuse to participate, he will inform them of Modi Zargul’s evidence in the hope that they will undertake their own investigations, much as they did during <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. Whilst it is not strictly essential that the Characters work with Schutzmann, running the adventure without the evidence and direction he can provide will prove challenging. It is recommended that Schutzmann offer whatever it takes to secure the Characters’ assistance.</em></p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-pouch.webp\" width=\"220\" height=\"157\" /></div>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>ONE PROBLEM DWARFS ANOTHER</h2>\n<p>The initial task set to the Komission, and the Characters, will be to track down the Purple Hand in Middenheim. However, another matter has caught Schutzmann’s attention, and given his justifiably paranoid state of mind in the aftermath of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, he does not wish to leave any stone unturned.</p>\n<p>Calling in Modi Zargul, @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} explains:<em> ‘A representative of the Dwarf Engineers’ Guild approached me earlier about a matter, and I thought your experience with cult activity may prove pertinent.’</em></p>\n<p>The stout Dwarf enters the room annoyed at having to wait, especially if the Characters drew out their negotiations with Schutzmann. Modi gestures to the dwarf books and grumbles. <em>‘Tomes of hard-earned lore my folk built up concerning best practices with gunpowder artillery. Last night a thief lifted them from our guild offices. We don’t take kindly to thieves, so she didn’t live, but when I reported the incident to the Marshal he thought it might interest you.’</em></p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} nods.<em> ‘I believe the thief may have been in cahoots with Wasmeier’s organisation. I suspect they may construct a siege weapon with which to shatter the Fauschlag, and lay waste to all of Middenheim.’</em></p>\n<p>Modi snorts.<em> ‘Unlikely that any Manling could engineer such a device without it blowing up in their face, but whoever wants these books is certainly interested in cannon.’</em></p>\n<p>@Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} dismisses Modi after this, directing the Characters to query him after the meeting if they have further questions. He then proceeds to brief the Characters on initial investigations. Depending on your players, you may wish to tailor which investigations to begin with from @JournalEntry[f1R6MmQIVDKENuy9]{The Order Impedimentae} onward. We suggest you begin with either @JournalEntry[f1R6MmQIVDKENuy9]{Ordo Impedimentae}, @JournalEntry[73yadEanBzBvwq1f]{The Great Defector}, or both of them at once.</p>\n<p>If the Characters later question Modi about the thief, he says she was a young woman who has since been taken to the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.u9uiiDA6oT5T8U6a]{Morrspark}. If Characters go there quickly, her body is being prepared to be thrown off the Cliff of Sighs. She does not have any purple clothing, and her body has no Purple Hand tattoo. However, she was wearing her own front incisor on a string about her neck and on a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test a Character catches a faint whiff of sewage.</p>\n<p>With this information in hand, the Characters are free to pursue the investigation as they wish. While @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} expects frequent updates, he is not overbearing about methodology. Once the Characters keep him informed he allows them a free hand in running the investigation.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/the-raid.webp\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/the-raid.webp","folder":"e5FR8IMJ42mpcjzd","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Instigating Events","sort":0}}}

Instead of starting with the cultist profile, create the NPC as normal and then add the Skills Lore (Skaven) and Secret Signs (Skaven) at an appropriate level, along with the Traits @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.PJ4oxDExnuFNr2Fi]{Secret Identity} and, if you wish, @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.xsGbDFqK2qh7lsIj]{Corruption (Minor)}.</p>\n<p>You might decide that a senior cultist has learned — or stolen — skills and other knowledge from a Skaven master. The exact Skills, Talents, and other knowledge will depend upon the Clan in question, and will usually not consist of anything beyond the scope of what a low to mid ranking member of that Clan might possess.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/mila-raast.webp\" width=\"229\" height=\"280\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[NpymoZchG7iGVZsJ]{Mila Raast}</p>\n<h3>Cult Wizards</h3>\n<p>Cult wizards are rare in the Yellow Fang, as the Skaven guard their magics jealously. However, a Man-thing with a talent for magic is a valued asset, and the cult takes special care to recruit those with a talent for Witchcraft. A member who has formal training as a Wizard would be particularly valuable, but so far no such individual has appeared — at least not in Middenheim. </p>\n<p>Any Yellow Fang spellcaster will have access to a handful of Petty spells and one or two Arcane spells at most. Skaven never teach spells from the Skaven Lores of Plague, Stealth, or Ruin, and while the Skaven do keep grimoires, these are often inscribed into the flesh of living slaves and therefore both inconvenient to place on bookshelves and difficult to decipher. An exceptionally cunning and accomplished cultist may be able to steal some magical knowledge, but this is incredibly rare, and the Grey Seers would hunt down such Man-things relentlessly.</p>\n<p>Yellow Fang wizards will often cast their spells in emulation of the Skaven. They will use spells like @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.WkItvLT52Bob8Up3]{Beast Form} to become a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.oenbbB0PitRWUBfZ]{Giant} or @Actor[VByGbXhrzcABHOS8]{Pox Rat}, will take on ratlike qualities when casting Fearsome, or will Produce Small Animal to exclusively create rats. </p>\n<p>Most magic-wielding members of the Yellow Fang are Witches, Mystics, or misled Hedge-Witches. A rare individual may follow the Wizard career. Such individuals will have better than usual access to Warpstone, however, despite how jealously the Skaven guard it. For more on how a reckless spellcaster can make use of Warpstone see @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.hGeXud7E91sHnz0w]{Magic Rules}.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/yellow-fang.webp","folder":"rPvLMyaTjjDryUKZ","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Yellow Fang","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"GDJrTdC0a8HHqyr8","name":"Clan Moulder Monstrosities","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/banner-moulder.webp\" width=\"291\" height=\"431\" /></div>\n<p>Clan Moulder has its stronghold in the depths of Hell Pit, far north of Praag, in the land of Kislev. Its proximity to the Northern Wastes, together with the huge reserves of Warpstone in its mines, make Hell Pit a nightmarish receptacle of the mutating energies of Chaos. The Masters of Clan Moulder have learned the art of controlling these mutations, and use them to create ferocious fighting beasts in foul experiments that combine mad surgery and the darkest of magics. </p>\n<p>The packmasters capture many different animals and monsters from the lands south of Hell Pit, but most of their subjects come from the savage Northern Wastes and the dangerous Troll Country. They study the creatures they capture and experiment on them with feverish imagination. Often they crossbreed those monstrosities in an attempt to create new specimens, carrying the most dangerous traits of both species involved. Other times, they try to implant new organs and limbs. All these experiments involve the use of their infamous mutating balms that contain finely powdered Warpstone to focus the mutating energies of Chaos on the unfortunate creatures. These foul oils make even the most extreme changes possible, allowing Clan Moulder to violate the laws of nature in their unholy quest to make the ultimate fighting beast.</p>\n<p>Clan Moulder sells its creatures to all Warlord Clans, and is a much-respected and sought-after ally for the ever-warring Skaven.</p>\n<h4>The Horned Rat</h4>\n<p>The Master Moulders of Clan Moulder and the Warlock Engineers of Clan Skryre have much in common. They are both fiendishly clever innovators and experimenters in their respective fields. The two Great Clans have even collaborated on several occasions. Clan Skryre technicians have supplied portable weaponry for the express purpose of being mounted on Clan Moulder warbeasts.</p>\n<p>Packlord Verminkin ended up voting in support of Project Moonbreaker in part because he believed it would please Lord Warlock Morskittar (in fact Morskittar had withdrawn his support for the project by the time Verminkin voted, but two of Verminkin’s heads had been arguing about Warpstone budgets, so he didn’t notice). </p>\n<p>When Verminkin came to realise that Morskittar was against the Moonbreaker project after all, his heads descended into confused recriminations. He came to a broad consensus with himself that, whilst it would be too embarrassing to be seen publicly working to sabotage the Moonbreaker project, he could work to see it spoiled and send a message to Morskittar explaining how he had always secretly been working in the interest of Clan Skryre. If successful, Verminkin could win back any regard he had cost Clan Moulder.</p>\n<p>He also retroactively reasoned that maintaining a status quo in the gathering and distribution of Warpstone would be beneficial to Clan Moulder. Most Warpstone gathered in recent years has come from the Dark Lands, where Warpstone meteors fall with predictable regularity to be found by scouts from Clan Rictus’s stronghold of Crookback Mountain.</p>\n<p>Given that Clan Mors are their greatest rivals, Clan Rictus tend to prefer to pass their wealth northwards, via Clan Moulder’s stronghold of Hell Pit, rather than south or westwards where Clan Mors could take their tolls. This situation is of great benefit to Packlord Verminkin. He has come to the realisation that he would have been better off opposing Project Moonbreaker, as a haul of Warpstone in the northern Empire, whilst it might be good for him in the short term, could weaken Clan Rictus’s position in the long term.</p>\n<p>Packlord Verminkin hopes he can stop Project Moonbreaker, but does not want to be seen doing so himself. Fortunately for him, Clan Rictus owe him a great deal, and also wish to see Clan Mors brought low. He plans to manipulate them into putting a stop to Moonbreaker by suggesting that Clan Mors could be dealt a severe blow as a direct result.</p>\n<h3>Clan Gritus</h3>\n<p>Clan Gritus were once part of @JournalEntry[SVn2i3Q3ZU2ihTYL]{Clan Mors}, but following the death of Great Warlord Vrrmik, there was no leader ruthless enough to prevent the vast clan from fracturing. Clan Gritus was one of the factions that split off before a new tyrant rose. Over a thousand years later, Clan Gritus is now a powerful clan in its own right, one that actively seeks out and preys on weaker clans. Those not destroyed are absorbed into its own ranks and as a result Clan Gritus boasts many slaves and captured war-beasts. Even after post-battle feeding and inter-clan trading, there is such a surplus that this stock is used for sport. Many of Clan Gritus’s warriors test their blades in lethal pit-fights and many bear scars, including the clan’s current Warlord who lost an eye in the games. Clan Gritus maintains an ample supply of both Stormvermin and captured weaponry (of which @Item[lP0b4ATxULZBpIvD]{Jezzails} are particularly prized) to help put down frequent slave revolts.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[kcXyxizGFp95lR7i]{The Hellbeast of Seep-Gore}</h4>\n<h4>@Actor[aHLN96g6uW6yFpvR]{Master Moulder Wrakrennch}</h4>\n<p>@Actor[vqKiWF0OuVwTnARC]{Packmaster}</p>\n<h4>Using the Hellbeast</h4>\n<p>Clan Gritus are spurred on by an unusual thirst for vengeance. Whilst most Skaven are vicious and resentful, they are not sentimental, and would not pursue a historic grudge. Skaven are born conspirators; they tend to lack the patience to invest in long-term plans unless it is as a result of the guiding vision of the Grey Seers.</p>\n<p>It has been many centuries since Clan Gritus suffered under the yoke of @Actor[u66iYrXRTW15bkTI]{Clan Mors}, and the great Warlord Clan has all but forgotten — Skaven are not particularly interested in learning about their own history. Yet, Clan Gritus maintain a tradition of resentment nursed with a desire for meticulous recompense more commonly associated with Dwarfs than Skaven.</p>\n<p>The desire to see Clan Mors brought low, for the old slaves to become the future masters, drives Clan Gritus.</p>\n<p>@Actor[kcXyxizGFp95lR7i]{The Hellbeast} is a significant war asset, a mighty creature capable of slaughtering lesser Skaven by the dozen, but is still vulnerable. A @JournalEntry[XzJenEYTArBENmQA]{Clan Eshin} agent could be hired to poison it, a skilled spellcaster could bewitch or destroy it. Keeping it secret and safe is an obsession of Clan Gritus. They may even leave the Under-Empire to move the creature, or house it for a period of time. Such operations could well come to the attention of the Characters.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>WRAKRENNCH’S MOTIVATIONS</em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Enact revenge against Clan Mors<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Enslave weaker clans<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Protect the Hellbeast<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Impress Clan Moulder<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Learn techniques Clan Moulder would prefer to keep to themselves<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Become a Great Clan and earn a place on the Council of Thirteen</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>The Hellbeast and Under-Middenheim</h4>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim} presents Clan Gritus with the perfect staging post from which to begin their assault on @Actor[u66iYrXRTW15bkTI]{Clan Mors}. Under-Altdorf is one of Clan Mors’s major holdings, but is nowhere near as heavily defended as their stronghold in the City of Pillars.</p>\n<p>@Actor[aHLN96g6uW6yFpvR]{Master Moulder Wrakrennch} plans to approach the Warlord-Castellan with an offer to rid him of the monsters in Middenheim’s Undercity that regularly slaughter Skaven patrols. Under this pretext he will bring the Hellbeast to @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim}, which happens to be at the end of a tunnel that leads to Under-Altdorf. Wrakrennch plans to lead it through this tunnel and set it rampaging throughout Clan Mors’s nests once their guard is down.</p>\n<h4>The Hellbeast and Clan Mange</h4>\n<p>Clan Gritus are keen to enslave weaker clans, and Clan Mange present a tempting target. @Actor[kcXyxizGFp95lR7i]{The Hellbeast} could be used to complicate the events of the Black Hunger by breaking the starving Skaven out, only to enslave them. </p>\n<h4>The Hellbeast and the Cult of the Yellow Fang</h4>\n<p>Clan Gritus have no connection to the Yellow Fang. If they were to learn of Human agents assisting the Skaven, they would be keen to employ them to move and conceal the Hellbeast.  However, the desire for more slaves is a constant driver of Clan Gritus, and should they find the Yellow Fang’s usefulness waning, they would be quick to clap them in irons and march them back to their home stronghold, never to be seen on the surface again.</p>\n<h4>The Hellbeast and Karak Skygg</h4>\n<p>Clan Gritus have been led to believe that Project Moonbreaker exists so that Clan Skryre can repay a debt to @Actor[u66iYrXRTW15bkTI]{Clan Mors}. This is nonsense. Like most Warlord Clans, Clan Mors is in debt to Clan Skryre, having hired the services of many weapons teams and Warlock Engineers over the years. Clan Gritus plan to assail Karak Skygg just as Manrack is readying the Moonbreaker Cannon. They hope to conquer the mountain, enslave the Skaven there, and then use it as a staging post for their campaign against Under-Altdorf. This is a stupid plan. Even if Clan Gritus pull it off, they will face immediate retaliation from Clan Skryre with the aid of Clan Mors. Clan Moulder, having orchestrated this disaster from the shadows, would also lend aid in ridding the world of Clan Gritus, considering the cost worth the benefit of earning trust in the eyes of Clan Skryre. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/clan-gritus.webp\" width=\"368\" height=\"461\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/banner-moulder.webp","folder":"mwbavITOKvFUhTrJ","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Multitudinous Clans","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"HMjEEwo1NrBVhyUA","name":"Tracking Down","content":"<p>There are several trails of clues to @Actor[WkrLGgu5qPHzUFiB]{Kalzbad’s} location at the @JournalEntry[BKNIAvKOocZQPEbU]{Shrine of the Holy Companion}. The first three leads are suggested by Lina if necessary.  Kalzbad departs on the Wolfenburg carriage just after dawn, two days after the party visits the Treasury. Once the party starts investigating, keep up the pace — make it clear the clock is ticking and Kalzbad could soon escape. Mention temple bells chiming the hour, the sun setting, and other signs that time is passing. If they ask an NPC when they encountered Kalzbad, the timeline above should help.</p>\n<p>Remember Kalzbad is active while the party investigates. He’s taking gold and documents, and setting fires. Plumes of smoke rising into the sky will give them a sense that the Magister is out there, covering his tracks.</p>\n<h3>Kalzbad’s Home </h3>\n<p>@Actor[WkrLGgu5qPHzUFiB]{Erich Kalzbad} lived in a comfortable but plain townhouse in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.aFOxMajVoBKRHinu]{Nordgarten} with his wife, Greta, their son, Jonas, and a few servants. Greta left the city two days ago by the East Gate, heading to Krudenwald where she will liaise with her husband. Jonas was left behind to continue his apprenticeship.</p>\n<h4>Jonas Kalzbad</h4>\n<p>Jonas is 17 years old and apprenticed to the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists} as a scribe. He is a surly youth who had a poor relationship with his parents. He has a long fringe, which he continually flicks out of his face while he talks.</p>\n<p>In the parlour is a portrait of Kalzbad, looking self-important with an abacus and a stack of ledgers. He has a porcelain pipe on the table beside him. The party will recognise him, if they see him in person.</p>\n<p>If they think to ask, Jonas will let them search Kalzbad’s study. The room stinks of pungent tobacco with a slight note of brimstone. Amongst a sheaf of papers on the top of Kalzbad’s desk is a partially decoded message, @JournalEntry[rqFVDsdO9EPSn55t]{Declaration of Change}. This will help the party decipher Chaos runes elsewhere.</p>\n<p>A successful <strong>Average (+20) Perception </strong>Test reveals a false drawer bottom in Kalzbad’s desk. This is empty, other than a signed receipt from Stiefel’s Emporium for 3 GCs and 14/-. Another <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test reveals faint purple ink stains on the writing surface — an unusual colour for anyone writing normal correspondence. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>CONVERSATION WITH </em><em>JONAS KALZBAD</em></h3>\n<p><em>On a successful <strong>Average (+20) Charm</strong> Test he will share the following with a rising intonation that makes every response sound like a question.</em></p>\n<h4><em>Where’s your father?</em></h4>\n<p><em>‘Who cares? I’m glad to see the back of the old man. The most boring person in Middenheim, as far as I’m concerned. He’s been gone a few days now?’</em></p>\n<h4><em>Where has he gone?</em></h4>\n<p><em>‘He was in a hurry, and just said he’s travelling on Treasury business for a few days? But he packed two big trunks for the road, which isn’t what you need for a few days, is it?’</em></p>\n<h4><em>What happened to the trunks?</em></h4>\n<p><em>‘Are you really that interested? Two trunks full of ledgers and the drabbest clothes imaginable? They were picked up yesterday. The carter was taking them to the Castle Rock Inn?’</em></p>\n<h4><em>Where’s your mother?</em></h4>\n<p><em>‘She left to visit some relatives in Hochland on the same day? Maybe they’re as uptight as her? I’d never heard of them before.’</em></p>\n<h4><em>Can we look around?</em></h4>\n<p><em>‘Be my guest. His study is through there? Nothing interesting there — the old man never did anything out of line. All the glamour of the Palace... the Princess, the Elves, the Ladies at Court… and he spent late nights in the counting house!’</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Englebrecht Offices</h3>\n<p>Piotr-Pavel Englebrecht didn’t supply any plague masks because he doesn’t exist. His company was a front created by Kalzbad to siphon funds to the Purple Hand. As the party approaches this address in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.QYipS3tpaNBDgKsN]{Geldmund}, they see a column of smoke and smell burning. They just missed Kalzbad, and he’s left a raging fire behind him.</p>\n<p>As they arrive, they find a modest merchant’s office up in flames. Chains of locals are throwing buckets of water onto the fire. The party can help, but the blaze is almost under control. There is a faint smell of brimstone coming from the fire. Asbjorn Thaler is sitting on a nearby barrel, staring into space and slightly singed.  </p>\n<p>Thaler is a burglar who was breaking into the building as Kalzbad set it alight. He is in a state of shock and, providing the party doesn’t make a big show of working for the Watch, he will tell them what he saw.</p>\n<h4>What happened?</h4>\n<p><em>‘Flames. The flames. They were dancing. I saw them. The flames were dancing. They were alive. They were grinning.’</em></p>\n<h4>Who lived here?</h4>\n<p><em>‘Never saw anyone. Never anyone here. But the soldier came each week. Brought boxes. Heavy strongboxes. The kind they fill with gold.’</em></p>\n<h4>The soldier?</h4>\n<p><em>‘City Guard. Nervous bloke.’</em></p>\n<h4>What were you doing here?</h4>\n<p><em>‘I wanted the boxes. The gold. Been watching the building. I can get into places. Get the gold. But he came and set the place alight with dancing flames .’</em></p>\n<h4>Who set the fire?</h4>\n<p><em>‘Didn’t see me. Serious bloke. Smelly pipe. Took paper. Took gold. Lit fire.’ </em></p>\n<h4>Where did he go?</h4>\n<p><em>‘Rode off in a chair. Chair with a silver wolf. Two soldiers carried him. Red shield patches.’ </em></p>\n<p>Nobody else saw @Actor[WkrLGgu5qPHzUFiB]{Kalzbad} leave in the sedan chair. The crowd watching the burning building know it was a merchant’s office, someone called Englebrecht, but nobody ever saw him. If the players treat  Asbjorn kindly he may be a useful contact in later investigations, as he knows Bors, the Ranaldan responsible for @JournalEntry[0Vz07cD1Twe2VB1Z]{Mysterious Thefts}.</p>\n<h3>The State Army Barracks</h3>\n<p>At the barracks in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.Hg1gM2q6cdyN8CcW]{Grafsplatz}, the party can visit the Paymaster’s Office to find out what happened to the missing wages. As the Watch are also headquartered in the barracks, they can use @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann’s} influence to meet with Paymaster Captain Tomas Binghelm, a short man who is eager to please.</p>\n<p>The Paymaster confirms that wages delivered match the correct regimental numbers, so the excess gold must have gone missing between the Treasury and the Barracks. The wages are transported every Konistag by wagon. Eight veteran halberdiers are assigned to guard its journey. Binghelm is happy to introduce the party to the guards.</p>\n<h4>Treasury Guard</h4>\n<p>A professional unit who take their jobs very seriously. They stand to attention as Captain Binghelm enters and answers questions as if on the parade ground. There are only seven guards here, and when asked about the missing person they explain that Sergeant Stoll has been on unplanned leave for two days. He can usually be found in the Sword and Flail in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.jGfyLhox6OTD75oi]{Nordtor}.</p>","folder":"d7Vfm1ivGEHXLNDs","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Ordo Impedimentae","sort":100000}}}

{"_id":"IV3IUZKE7N7kmRSR","name":"Part Three: Leaving for Lindenheim","content":"<p>Whether travelling by night or day, the party is about five miles from Lindenheim when the weather changes. Such things are not uncommon in the foothills, especially in late afternoon after a summer day’s heat or at night as the sunless air cools and can no longer hold as much moisture.</p>\n<p>A rumble of thunder is the only warning. The sky darkens: day becomes almost as dark as night, or if it’s night the stars are hidden and cannot be used to navigate. Then rain comes down in great sheets, its hiss muffling all noises, imposing a –20 penalty to all Perception and Navigation Tests. The occasional flash of lightning does nothing to help matters, giving everyone one @Condition[Blinded] Condition that takes two rounds to clear.</p>\n<p>Worse still, the road becomes a rutted stream, with no hope of identifying any footprints. However, the trail of trampled undergrowth is still just about discernable, requiring a <strong>Challenging (+0) Track </strong>Test from now on.</p>\n<p>The storm begins to abate as the party approaches Lindenheim — if they decide to find shelter and wait it out, it lasts for about an hour. They reach the strangely pristine village wet, bedraggled, and mud-stained, applying a –20 to any Fellowship-based Tests when dealing with those of Silver 2 status or higher. The idyllic charm of the village is undiminished by the rain — in fact, it is enhanced if anything. Rays of sunshine peek through the clouds, making the spotless cottages glisten and the surrounding fields look almost too green to be real.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>NIGHT’S DARK TERRORS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Travelling through the forest at night — even along a road — is not an undertaking for the faint of heart. Ambushes by Beastmen, bandits, and other foes can challenge the Characters, but perhaps worse — for those Characters without @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.x0WMGwuQzReXcQrs]{Night Vision} — are the unexplained rustles and snaps of things moving through the undergrowth, just a few yards away. Is it the sound of a monster stalking the party, or just some harmless creature going about its business? Screech owls fly almost silently, alighting on a branch just a few yards away before letting loose a blood-curdling scream that can take anyone by surprise.</em></p>\n<p><em>A good way to work on the nerves of night-travelling Characters — and their Players — is to describe unexplained sounds from time to time, adding just enough encounters to keep the players from dismissing everything they hear. One serious encounter every other night will be plenty, but timing is critical.</em></p>\n<p><em>Keep the Players guessing, so that every noise ratchets up the tension just a little more. If a noise is particularly sudden and unexpected, you might require a @Fear[1]{Fear (1)} Test.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Nothing To See Here</h3>\n<p>The village of Lindenheim is a community of foresters and smallholders, centred on the Lindenheim Trading Post, a hub for the region’s merchants, farmers, foresters, and trappers to do business. As such, the village is somewhat more wealthy than might be expected for such a settlement, and the locals have spent their wealth on maintaining one of the more picturesque villages in the Empire. As the Characters make their way through the village, they may see a few things that give them pause.</p>\n<h4>Burning Waste</h4>\n<p>In the distance, a handful of villagers are tending a large bonfire, which smokes fitfully. It seems to be made of wet brushwood, although people are bringing dry fuel from their own homes to help it burn brighter.</p>\n<p>If the Characters leave the road to get a better look at the bonfire, they are challenged and directed, politely but forcefully, toward the village centre and its inn, the <em>Orchard View</em> (which shockingly lacks any orchards within sight). The villagers explain they are simply burning some rubbish, as villagers everywhere must do from time to time, and since the local laws on trespassing are quite strict, it would be better for everyone if the visitors kept to the road. The Characters are left with the choice of respecting their wishes or causing an incident.</p>\n<p>If any Character is able to approach the fire undetected, they see that beneath a covering of brushwood, the bonfire consists of a mix of wood, dead bodies, and bones. The wind may shift as the Characters pass by, blowing the smell of smoke toward them — and with it, the tang of burning flesh, detected with a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test.</p>\n<h4>Signs of Trouble</h4>\n<p>Despite the rain, it is clear that a large group of <em>something </em>came out of the woods and headed toward the village. Undergrowth is flattened, just as in the trail the Characters may have followed from Hohenfahrt. A successful <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> or Track Test allows a Character to spy a footprint here and there that has not been completely obliterated by the rain — or by a small crew of villagers who are busily shovelling and sweeping, wiping out these unsightly traces.</p>\n<p>If questioned, they politely respond that they are simply repairing some damage caused by the storm and by a herd of deer that stampeded out of the woods, apparently panicked by the lightning. The people of Lindenheim like their village to be neat and tidy, they explain, and repairs are best made promptly before things have time to deteriorate.</p>\n<p>The Characters hear a similar story from a small crew of villagers who are scrubbing and repainting darkened spots on a couple of cottages close to the road. Lightning struck close by, they say, giving everyone a fright and blackening the fronts of the two buildings. This completely ruined the look of them, and must be repaired right away.</p>\n<h4>Respect for the Dead</h4>\n<p>Lindenheim’s graveyard stands a little way out of the village, on the road that leads toward @JournalEntry[56cL3qsLbEtoY81L]{the Picket}. There as elsewhere, a small crew of villagers is busy tending to the graves, apparently filling a couple of them in. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception </strong>Test reveals that this seems odd because their headstones are far from new.</p>\n<p>Once again, the villagers explain this as routine maintenance, saying that the heavy rain caused a little localised subsidence which gave the graveyard an unappealing look. The dead deserve respect, they say, and that extends to fresh flowers and neatly tended graves. A second <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test allows a Character to catch sight of a stiff, dead hand sticking up through the gravedirt as one of the villagers heaps fresh soil on it. In what must surely be a trick of the light or an effect of the rain, the hand seems to form a fist as earth is thrown over it, as though grasping at something unseen.</p>\n<h3>A Well-Ordered Community</h3>\n<p>Lindenheim is a very well-ordered and peaceful community. The villagers like it that way, and they are prepared to go to considerable lengths to make sure that everything remains peaceful and orderly, for the common good.</p>\n<p>‘The common good’ is something of an obsession in Lindenheim, and the longer the Characters talk to the villagers, the more frequently they hear the phrase. The villagers have no intention of admitting to anyone that anything as distasteful as an undead attack occurred here, last night or at any other time in the village’s history. Characters who pay no heed to the villagers’ increasingly emphatic hints about minding their own business may come to regret it. Should they keep to themselves, they have little trouble in Lindenheim, but if they seem likely to carry away stories that would paint the village in a poor light, they may not be so fortunate. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/angry-villagers.webp\" width=\"317\" height=\"397\" /></div>\n<h3>The Common Good</h3>\n<p>If the Characters have poked their nose in where it is not wanted, and choose to stay at the <em>Orchard View </em>that night, the proprietor Arhaus Gubentrots, a Middenlander affecting a refined accent he most certainly was not born with, drills them intensively about what they know. He pretends to know little of what goes on in the village, asking the Characters what they have seen. If they reveal they have suspicions, especially of anything related to the undead, the innkeeper forms a plot to poison the Characters via a nightcap offered <em>‘on the house’</em> before they leave the bar for their rooms that night.</p>\n<p>Have whichever Character does most of the talking make a <strong>Hard (–20) Charm</strong> Test. If they fail, Gubentrots attempts the poisoning, offering a shot of Bretonnian brandy (actually a common local brew with a fancy label that says ‘Bret-hon-ian Brandy’ and little else). This has been laced with @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.W4X1Jx8AN84yRPDx]{Spit}, a hallucinogen that dulls the mind and provides visions of what the user truly desires. If the Characters made any quips about the lack of an orchard at <em>Orchard View</em>, you may forgo the Charm Test, as Gubentrots is quite sensitive about the inn’s name and will go ahead and poison them regardless of how charming they have been.</p>\n<p>Once all the Characters are disabled by the drug, or at least appear to be, a group of locals enter the bar, solemnly intoning ‘<em>The common good</em>’ before grabbing the Characters, tying them up, and throwing them on the remains of the day’s bonfire, which they then attempt to rekindle. The Characters come to around the time the flames are getting started, and have to move quickly to escape.</p>\n<p>Should the Characters not all take the poisoned drink, or detect its presence via a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test, Gubentrots assesses the situation before signalling for aid. If most of the Characters are affected by the dose of Spit, he pretends to be terribly concerned and sends the lucid Characters for a doktor. In fact a group of locals, two for each Character, are waiting for them in ambush just outside the inn. If most of the Characters are unaffected, Gubentrots says he will go for the doktor himself. He gathers up more villagers, returning with a group of at least twice as many people as the Characters. He declares to anyone else in the inn that the Characters are heretics in conflict with ‘<em>The common good</em>’, and attempts to drag them from the bar to the bonfire.</p>\n<p>In either case, the Characters will likely be hesitant to return to Lindenheim. Assuming the Characters survive, any of the surviving villagers or Gubentrots himself will tell them the truth of what happened if threatened. A necromancer appeared at the start of the storm and raised many of the town’s dead to accompany the great many zombies and skeletons that already shuffled alongside him. The villagers rose up and resisted the necromancer, who responded with some very poorly aimed blasts of magic and ineffectual monologuing about his <em>‘right to rule all the living by writ of his mastery over all of the dead.’</em> After he was hit in the head with a thrown boot, he fled back to the forests. Lindenheimers are a tough lot, obsessed with the prestige and status of their tiny village, and the entire population rushed to its defence. They drove back the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombies}, who, without the leadership of a talented necromancer, were quite ineffective. The villagers then began the process of covering the entire thing up.</p>","folder":"xzib7Wt4bGWxCCv6","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Return of the Gravelord","sort":400000}}}

The through-road heads towards Middenheim and southwards into Hochland.</p>\n<p>As the Characters approach Unterfraus, they become aware of a strange silence and stillness in the air. This could just be their imagination playing tricks on them, of course. There are no animals out grazing in the fields. They are still in the enclosures and sheds in which they normally spend the night. Their distressed barks, bleets, crows, moos, and yelps reverberate around the village, adding to the unsettling atmosphere.

{"_id":"KzG2UprDpSYy10eR","name":"Skaven Magic","content":"<p>Skaven magic, much like the creatures themselves, is particularly dangerous and unpredictable. Though they have a natural affinity for Warpstone — the raw stuff of Chaos and a potent source of magic — the Skaven have little natural magical ability. Instead, they must consume Warpstone for any hope to work the Winds of Magic. </p>\n<h3>Skaven Magic Users</h3>\n<p>The Grey Seers are the mage-priests of the Horned Rat. Unlike other gods, the Horned Rat provides no miracles to his devout followers. However, the magical might the Grey Seers derive from their consumption of Warpstone fulfils this role in Skaven society, and the practice of magic is irrevocably associated with worshipping the Horned Rat.</p>\n<p>This makes the existence of other magic users in Skaven society, such as the Festering Chantors of Clan Pestilens, the rumoured Sorcerers of Clan Eshin, and the Harbingers of Mutation of Clan Moulder, troublesome to the Grey Seers — the 169 commandments of the Horned Rat suggest that magical practice not tied to worshipping the Horned Rat is heretical. Clan Pestilens in particular has a number of skilled magic users who wield great powers of pestilence and decay, but the Grey Seers are suspicious as to the source of these powers. While the clan maintains that their grasp of plague and disease is a gift of the Horned Rat, their knowledge and prowess far exceeds that of any other Skaven clan.</p>\n<p>The Warlock Engineers of Clan Skryre are less troublesome in this regard, as their peerless blending of magic and technology is more explicable to the Grey Seers; Clan Skryre’s studies are permitted according to the Black Pillar of Commandments. Still, the Warlock Engineers’ technomancy gives them powers the Grey Seers would rather they alone wielded, and so they are still watched with a degree of healthy paranoia.</p>\n<p>Though the clan vigorously denies their existence, the Sorcerers of Clan Eshin appear to have learned their craft from Cathay. Their grasp of the shadowy ways of <em>Ulgu </em>is impressive, though these spellcasters weave far more <em>Dhar </em>into their magic than any but the most depraved Human wizards would dare attempt. It is by their magics that Skaven infiltrators have breached some of the most impregnable enemy fortifications. Their sorcery also causes the bodies of most Eshin Gutter Runners, should they die on the surface, to boil away to a greasy puddle — the better to keep the foolish surface dwellers in ignorance of the soon-to-be-ascendant empire broiling beneath their feet.</p>\n<h4>Rules</h4>\n<p>Skaven spellcasters have their own lists of Petty and Arcane spells from which to choose. Skaven grimoires are all but impossible to decipher by other wizards, and in any case Skaven magic is of a somewhat different nature to that taught at the Colleges of Altdorf. While it is up to the GM if Skaven spellcasters can learn the Arcane spells presented in @JournalEntry[v10 placeholder]{Arcane Spells}, non-Skaven are strictly forbidden from learning any spells from the Lores of Plague, Stealth, and Ruin.</p>\n<h4>Careers</h4>\n<p>Skaven Grey Seers, Clan Moulder Harbingers of Mutation, and Clan Eshin Sorcerers use the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.m6WuSnrrW7QllX63]{Wizard} Career. Warlock Engineers also use the Wizard Career, but they must also have completed at least one tier of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.career-descriptions.c2n86bcUngGrHyO4]{Engineer} Career.

Aside from the original Council members, the number of Skaven to have survived this ordeal may be counted on one paw.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Skaven Magic and Warpstone</h4>\n<p>Skaven must consume Warpstone to wield the Winds of Magic — it is an essential part of the Skaven metabolism, and Skaven who use magic quickly burn away the traces of Warpstone in their own bodies. In game terms there is little effect, as most Skaven sorcerers are presumed to have consumed enough for any spells they need. However, if cut off from their supply of Warpstone for a significant amount of time, their ability to cast spells fades. Of course, most Skaven sorcerers are hopelessly addicted to Warpstone, typically carrying about a fair quantity of @Item[DfRFSjI6SyD4ubpM]{Warpstone Tokens}, and perish if denied it for long.</p>\n<p>For Skaven, using the refined Warpstone found in @Item[DfRFSjI6SyD4ubpM]{Warpstone Tokens} is a little different from consuming the raw stuff of Chaos itself. Before casting a spell or channelling, a Skaven magic user can eat up to three Warpstone Tokens to boost their powers. Each Token adds +2 SL to the relevant Casting or Channelling Test, but does not double the SL of the Test or count as casting near a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.hGeXud7E91sHnz0w]{malignant influence}. Consuming three Warpstone Tokens adds +6 SL, and in addition the result of the Test is doubled and the rules for casting near a malignant influence applied just as if the caster was using a piece of raw Warpstone.

Poor harvests, aye, and bandits bin’ raiding granaries across Middenland. Something voracious has been through all the cabbage fields in the lee of the Middle Mountains. Dietrich Hoffman from the Farmer’s Association ain’t ruling out shortages if the Graf don’t sort it out.’<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>I heard that those Sons of Ulric stopped Harald the blacksmith yesterday. Apparently they told him to quit making hammers. “Too Sigmarite,” they said. “How’s a man supposed to drive a nail with no hammer?” he asked them. Ha! They didn’t have an answer for that one, so they broke both his legs. They used a hammer to do it too! There’s irony for you.’ <br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Sure they opposed the unfair taxes, but can you really trust those wizards? Always meddling with things good folk shouldn’t touch, I say. They can turn lead into gold, so why would taxes even bother them? Something’s up there, you mark my words.’<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Lot of folks coming to Middenheim searching for missing family of late.

The way some of them wail, I’d say half of their families disappeared just to get away from the noise.’<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>It’s good to see the Graf getting back to his old self. I thought he’d never get over the death of his wife, but there he was, all noble and lordly, voice booming. Took that heretic’s head clean off with one swing of his Runefang! I love a good public execution, good for morale.’<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>It’s a bad outbreak of the scabrous pox this year. Shallya’s lot are barely keeping it under control, bless them. Oh all praise to Ulric, don’t get me wrong, but it weren’t Ar-Ulric who gave me a bottle of soothing cream down the Altquartier, if you get me.

{"_id":"MPy8SrTVRveJyXLe","name":"Part Five: Carrion Over the Mountains","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/carrion.webp\" width=\"312\" height=\"300\" /></div>\n<p>The end of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong> sees the Characters escaping from an exploding Karak Skygg in a balloon, along with Baron @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich Todbringer} and, possibly, a few other powerful NPCs. The course is set for Middenheim, and everyone has time to treat their wounds (and perhaps hide their mutations, for the more unfortunate) and to bask in the glow of having saved the Old World from almost certain annihilation. It is a rare moment of triumph — this being <strong>WFRP</strong>, it deserves to be interrupted.</p>\n<h3>He Thought So All Along</h3>\n<p>Although @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} left the vicinity of the depot when the Characters set off for Brass Keep or a little earlier, his reasons for doing so bothered him. It was clear, from his egomaniacal point of view, that an army was being raised against him, and even if he did not want to delay his journey for too long to defeat it — for he is the Gravelord, and therefore his victory is inevitable — he could not help feeling that he ought to do something.</p>\n<p>He wrestled with this feeling for several days as he made his way over the mountains toward the Forest of Shadows. His intention was to visit the cave where the defeated Zacharias had hidden, and where he had met the Dragon whose blood restored him. Instead, from a vantage point high above the mountains’ more passable valleys, he spied a small group making their way through the pass. It was just as he thought — the Characters were indeed after him personally, for why else would they make their way into such inhospitable terrain as the peaks of the Middle Mountains?</p>\n<p>Hiding among the rocks above a narrow pass, he saw them cross below him. The fools clearly had no idea where he was, As he watched, they made their way into what appeared to be the mouth of a Dwarf hold. The fools obviously had no idea where he was!</p>\n<p>Immediately, a plan began to form in his mind. He would wait until the Characters were inside the hold, and ambush them as they came out. He would finally be rid of their bothersome pursuit and, having done away with his most fiendish and persistent enemies, the name of the Gravelord would finally be whispered in the fearful tones reserved for Helsnicht, Melkhior, and Zacharias. Once he met with these vaunted necromancers, for surely they still existed, they were bound to treat him with due respect when he demanded their tutelage.</p>\n<p>The Gravelord spent several hours getting into position, marshalling his remaining forces, and preparing for an attack on Karak Skygg. Even as he approached Karak Skygg, the rumblings from within gave him pause. When he witnessed the final fate of the karak and the Moonbreaker cannon, even his inflated ego was momentarily dumbstruck.</p>\n<p>Just as he was wondering what to do, Gräber saw a great balloon flying away from the peak as its crew winched up a platform holding a group of figures that seemed familiar, even at this distance. He knew that this was his chance for revenge.</p>\n<h3>Something in the Air</h3>\n<p>This incident takes place just when the Players start to think that the adventure is over. This may be as soon as they board the balloon, or after an hour or two in the air. The moment the Characters stop scanning the horizon for further enemies and start thinking about what they will do when they return to Middenheim, it begins.</p>\n<h4>Enemy Dead, a Head</h4>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} first move is to confirm his suspicion that the Characters— those dogged adversaries who have caused him so much trouble — are indeed aboard the balloon. He does this by enchanting another skull and sending it up to take a look.</p>\n<p>A shout goes up from the crew as the thing zips along the deck at shoulder height, whipping around obstacles and onlookers before coming to a hover in front of the Characters. They barely have time to notice that it has something in its jaws before it drops it to the deck and dives over the nearest rail, dropping back toward the ground at high speed.</p>\n<p>All this happens very quickly. The Characters can make one round of attacks against the skull, and so can any NPCs who make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test to get over their surprise at the thing’s sudden appearance. The object it dropped on the deck is a folded note: when it is opened, any Characters who encountered Gräber’s Carrion in ‘The Vengeance of the Gravelord’ can recognise the handwriting. It reads: <em>‘Tremble Before the Wrath of the Gravelord.’</em></p>\n<h4>Dead from Above</h4>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} plan is to disable the balloon and force it to the ground, so that its passengers and crew will be at his mercy. The quickest way to achieve this is to put a large number of holes in its gas bag.</p>\n<p>A minute or so after receiving the Gravelord’s message, several things happen at once.</p>\n<p>Three @Actor[KE2xU8UltLaCnulO]{Carrion} rise up from the ground — Gräber managed to repair any damage from their previous encounter — each clutching something in its talons. A second or two later, a larger creature flaps laboriously into the air, with a rider on its back and a similar something grasped in each clawed foot.</p>\n<p>Any Character who makes a successful <strong>Very Hard (–30) Perception</strong> Test can identify the rider as @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} (if they have seen him before) and the flying monsters’ burdens as Skeletons. There are five @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Mt5JAoOSaEH1PdcP]{Skeletons}in total: each Carrion has one Skeleton in its claws, and Gräber’s @Actor[knwmphDyAMfrUYJJ]{Abyssal Terror} carries one in each foot. The Test may be repeated each round, its Difficulty decreasing one step per round as the creatures come closer.</p>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} plan is to drop the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Mt5JAoOSaEH1PdcP]{Skeletons} on the top of the balloon and order them to slash it to ribbons. It takes four rounds for his flying creatures to climb above the balloon, during which time they may be attacked with spells and ranged weapons. On the fifth round, the balloon itself blocks any line of sight from the deck as the creatures drop their Skeletons.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Mt5JAoOSaEH1PdcP]{Skeletons} that make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics</strong> Test are able to hold on; those that fail slide off and plummet to the ground. The next round, each Skeleton draws a knife from its teeth and begins to stab and tear at the balloon’s canopy.</p>\n<p>The balloon can take 200 points of damage before it starts losing height and is eventually forced down. Each round, each @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Mt5JAoOSaEH1PdcP]{Skeleton} inflicts 4 points of damage. If all five are stabbing away, they cause 20 points of damage per round — which means that the balloon’s passengers and crew have only 10 rounds to prevent them from causing catastrophic damage.</p>\n<h3>Clambering About</h3>\n<p>Clearly, the balloon is doomed unless someone deals with the Skeletons. Any Character can scale the rigging that secures the balloon to its gondola and the wide-mesh rope net that encloses the gas bag. Characters must make a Climb test each round to keep their footing. On a success they can move about normally, clambering about at up to their Movement in yards each round. On a Marginal Failure (0 to –1 SL) they may attack as normal, but they are unable to move about on this turn. On a Failure (–2 to –3 SL) it is all the Character can do to cling on, and they may make no other action or movement. On an Impressive Failure (–4 to –5 SL) or worse they fall, plummeting either down on to the deck of the ship if they are lucky (that is, spend a Fortune Point) or out of the balloon and to their deaths if not. A nearby Character may make a Challenging (+0) Initiative Test to grab a falling Character. If they succeed they may make a Difficult (+0) Strength Test on their turn to swing the Character back on to the balloon — with an Impressive Failure (–4 to –5 SL) or worse seeing both characters plummeting off the balloon instead.</p>\n<h4>Fighting the Skeletons</h4>\n<p>Once within reach of a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Mt5JAoOSaEH1PdcP]{Skeleton}, fighting will not be easy. Most Characters will require both feet and one hand to hold on to the balloon. These restricted circumstances impose a –10 penalty to all attack rolls.</p>\n<p>Any attack that is badly botched — an Impressive or Astounding Failure — or any wounding blow requires the Character to make a successful <strong>Easy (+40) Athletics</strong> Test or lose their grip, sliding down the canopy of the balloon until they can grasp a rope and save themselves from a long, long fall. Even if successful, the Character must make a <strong>Hard (–20) Dexterity</strong> Test or drop any handheld item as they scramble to prevent themselves falling. By the end of the process, they have to spend 2 rounds climbing back up to attack the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Mt5JAoOSaEH1PdcP]{Skeleton}, making Tests along the way as detailed above.</p>\n<p>The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Mt5JAoOSaEH1PdcP]{Skeletons} defend themselves with their knives, but suffer the same difficulties as any Characters attacking them. They use the standard profile from the <strong>WFRP </strong>rulebook, but are unarmoured and their @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.83KlMxHxGfKUdMfq]{Knives} count as a Weapon +4.</p>\n<p>After destroying a Skeleton, a Character must climb for 2 rounds to reach the next one.</p>\n<h3>It Gets Worse</h3>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber}, being a genius, has foreseen that his enemies will probably climb up and try to destroy his @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Mt5JAoOSaEH1PdcP]{Skeletons} before they can damage the balloon too badly. As the Characters climb up (or watch others climb) to deal with the Skeletons, something dark and smoky rises from the ground below, boiling upward toward the balloon. As the dark cloud passes by the gondola, those on deck can see that it is a swarm of massive bats.</p>\n<p>Close behind the swarm are two much larger bats: their bodies are as long as a man’s, and their wingspan must be twenty feet at least. Many Characters will assume that these are Giant Bats, but a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Undead) </strong>Test identifies them as Undead: the dread Fell Bats feared by the folk of Sylvania.</p>\n<p>As if these were not bad enough, anyone watching @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} on his @Actor[knwmphDyAMfrUYJJ]{Abyssal Terror} sees that, although he makes no move to come closer, he is making gestures that look very much like the casting of a spell. At the end of the first round, three disembodied skulls hover at his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Each round, the GM should roll once on the @Table[it-gets-worse]{It Gets Worse Table} for each Character climbing or fighting on the outside of the balloon. They are attacked by the creature indicated on the table or targeted by one of the Gravelord’s spells. All these attacks take place at the end of the round. Players may choose to spend a Fortune point instead of rolling, which ensures their Character is not attacked that round.</p>\n<p>Ignore impossible results. @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} can cast only one spell per round, and no creature can attack more than once. For example, if all the surviving @Actor[KE2xU8UltLaCnulO]{Carrion} have already attacked in this round, a further roll of 7 is treated as ‘no attack’.</p>\n<p>Just like wounding attacks from the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Mt5JAoOSaEH1PdcP]{Skeletons}, any wounding attack generated on this table forces the victim to make an <strong>Easy (+40) Athletics </strong>Test or risk losing their grip on the balloon.</p>\n<h4>Squadron Scramble!</h4>\n<p>Characters who have the ability to fly via the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.9wmmln3DunIqGXM2]{Fly} spell can choose to attack the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Mt5JAoOSaEH1PdcP]{Skeletons} or protect their comrades on the balloon by engaging the Gravelord’s airborne units in battle.</p>\n<p>This is easier than they might suppose, since any flying Characters have the enemy’s undivided attention. If anyone is flying, no one on the balloon is attacked. Instead, all attacks are focused on the flying Character. This includes the @Actor[KE2xU8UltLaCnulO]{Carrion}, any @Actor[FRS2PzhU3H98XfTX]{Flying Death Skulls}, and @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s}  spells.</p>\n<p>Once any flying threats have been defeated or forced back on to the balloon, attacks on the balloon resume their normal pattern.</p>\n<h4>I Got One!</h4>\n<p>Characters who are not climbing the balloon may provide supporting fire to those who are. Any creature that receives a wounding hit may not attack until the next round.</p>\n<h4>Boarders Repelled</h4>\n<p>Once all the Skeletons have been destroyed, Gräber’s force changes tactics. Any surviving @Actor[KE2xU8UltLaCnulO]{Carrion} land on the top of the balloon and start tearing into it with their beaks, causing 9 points of damage each per round. A roll of 7 on the table above is treated as ‘no attack’.</p>\n<p>Any Character on the outside of the balloon can attack the Carrion in the same way as the Skeletons (see <strong>Fighting the Skeletons</strong> above). Meanwhile, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} and any other surviving monsters keep attacking as before.</p>\n<h3>The Gravelord Triumphant</h3>\n<p>If the balloon suffers 200 points of damage, it begins to lose altitude, reaching the ground in five rounds. This will not be a crashing freefall, as solid Dwarf redundancy in the balloon’s manufacture means that it is all but impossible to drain every gas bag at once. Still, everyone will suffer the effects of a 3 yard fall when the balloon does come crashing to the earth (see @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.1gNxlCdPV1C3oZ6Z]{Leaping and Falling}). This still gives its passengers and crew time to destroy @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} force, or at least weaken it so that he abandons his plan to turn twenty or so Skeletons on them as they land, while delivering another of his bombastic speeches. Instead, he slinks off into the forest, leaving the Characters and their companions with a long delay as they repair the balloon.</p>\n<h3>The Gravelord Defeated</h3>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} retreats if he loses all three of his @Actor[KE2xU8UltLaCnulO]{Carrion}, or if he loses more than half his Wounds. If his @Actor[knwmphDyAMfrUYJJ]{Abyssal Terror} is killed, he loses control of the rest of his forces as he struggles to avert a crash landing: any surviving @Actor[FRS2PzhU3H98XfTX]{Flying Death Skulls} become inert and fall from the sky; and any surviving Carrion break off their attacks and follow their master to the ground. Only the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Mt5JAoOSaEH1PdcP]{Skeletons} remain, doggedly hacking at the balloon’s skin until they are destroyed.</p>\n<h3>EXPERIENCE POINT AWARDS</h3>\n<p>@Exp[5, Rumour recovered from the Collegium Theologica]{5 points per rumour recovered from the Collegium Theologica.}</p>\n<p>@Exp[5–10, Dealt with the inhabitants of Hohenfahrt]{5–10 points per Character for dealing with the inhabitants of Hohenfahrt.}</p>\n<p>@Exp[5–10, Dealt with the inhabitants of Lindenheim]{5–10 points per Character for dealing with the inhabitants of Lindenheim.}</p>\n<p>@Exp[5, Destroyed a Skeleton or Flying Death Skull]{5 points per Character involved for destroying each Skeleton or Flying Death Skull.}</p>\n<p>@Exp[10, Destroyed a Carrion]{10 points per Character involved for destroying each Carrion.}</p>\n<p>@Exp[20, Wounded Gräber badly enough to make him break off the attack]{20 points per Character involved for wounding Gräber badly enough to make him break off the attack.}</p>\n<p>@Exp[25, Resolved the final encounter without the balloon being forced to the ground]{25 points per Character involved for resolving the final encounter without the balloon being forced to the ground.}</p>","folder":"xzib7Wt4bGWxCCv6","sort":600000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Return of the Gravelord","sort":600000}}}

The individual Skaven Clans sit below the Council. Some have direct representation within the thirteen, while others petition, threaten, and connive to get their way. The most powerful of these are the Warlord Clans, which form the vast bulk of Skaven society. Below them are the Thralls: significant clans that nevertheless must abase themselves at the foot of a more powerful warlord or risk annihilation. Clanless Skaven are almost unheard of, and indeed the phrase is interchangeable with the word for ‘food’ in Queekish.</p>\n<h2>The Warlord Clans</h2>\n<p>@JournalEntry[XzJenEYTArBENmQA]{Clan Eshin}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[SVn2i3Q3ZU2ihTYL]{Clans Mors}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[WB26MGDboQXbFKgS]{Clan Rictus}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[QcVM1YRuOEjblPll]{The Pestilent Brotherhood}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[GDJrTdC0a8HHqyr8]{Clan Moulder Monstrosities}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[OAmYmBoQ6Eld7CBb]{Clan Skyre}</p>\n<p>At its peak, a single Warlord Clan could number in the hundreds of thousands and spread across a score of different lairs and strongholds. There is no knowing how many different clans there are scattered throughout the Under-Empire, though there are certainly many hundreds, if not thousands. The larger, more powerful Warlord Clans actively seek out and destroy smaller clans, absorbing their numbers as warriors or slaves, or simply gorging upon them as the unbearable pangs of the black hunger take hold.</p>\n<p>Large or strong clans (usually one and the same thing) are less likely to be attacked by rivals and are more able to exert their will over lesser clans. The most successful Warlords effectively rule all of the surrounding clans, exacting tolls and demanding heavy tributes, becoming increasingly wealthy as a result. However, clans that grow too large and fractious can, if the Warlord is not aggressive enough, split into rivalling factions.</p>\n<h3>Primus Inter Rattus</h3>\n<p>There are no equals in Warlord Clans, only underlings and superiors. It is a rat-eat-rat existence where the weak are slain (and often devoured) by the strong. Considering their comparatively short lifespan, if a Skaven is to gain rank and status, they must do so as quickly as possible. The Skaven are obsessed with short-term gain and will construct an increasingly elaborate web of false promises, imaginary wealth, and dubious bargains if there is even the slightest chance of success. </p>\n<p>One of the quickest ways to gain power in the Under-Empire is to secure an alliance with a more powerful faction. The price of such a pact is invariably extortionate, but for a budding Warlord, the opportunity for power is simply irresistible — especially if the ally in question can be double-crossed and disposed of at a later stage.</p>\n<p>It is rare for a Skaven army to be composed of warriors exclusively from one clan. When the time arises to attack a foe, be it an army of surface dwellers, who hold the greatest bounties of plunder, or a rival clan, a Warlord gathers warriors and weaponry from any available source. Skaven from surrounding clans flock to a Warlord’s banner, either for a share in the spoils of war or in the vain hopes of securing an alliance of their own. Weaker clans can be coerced and threatened into sending troops (who inevitably form the first wave of an attack) whilst stronger clans grow fat on the profits required to purchase their aid. </p>\n<p>Skaven logic in these matters is simple: power and wealth buys (and bribes) better warriors, weapons, and war-beasts, which in turn assures a higher chance of victory and increasing power and wealth, and so on. One of the most prestigious and destructive sources of arms are the Great Clans, whose skills and weaponry are in high demand. It is for this very reason that the Great Clans have become so rich and powerful.</p>\n<p>To a non-Skaven, all the Warlord Clan hordes may look the same. However, to a keen observer, or the ratmen themselves, there are distinctive differences. Clan markings and symbols, freely interspersed with the rune, icon, or visage of the Horned Rat, are often painted, scratched, daubed, or smeared atop shields, banners, and pennants. Some clans are known to wear rats, clothing, or armour of a specific colour. Others dye their fur with distinctive bandings or patterns, marking out the members of different Clawpacks. Some clans brand Skaven runes or clan icons into their skin so that their foes know who they are facing. Some Skaven are even mutilated, typically with scars and notches in their ears to mark allegiance or ownership. A great many banners and markings are present when Skaven armies muster. However, these visual differences blur amidst the ravenous hordes, and even the ratmen tend to rely upon their own keen sense of smell to find their clanmates.</p>\n<h2>THE THRALL CLANS</h2>\n<p>Whilst all Warlord Clans are eager to secure treaties and pacts with more powerful clans, there are those who cannot purchase such alliances. Some Warlord Clans willingly throw in their lot with one of the four Great Clans, trading total obedience for otherwise unobtainable power. These clans, known as Thrall Clans, are effectively extensions of the Great Clans. </p>\n<p>Whether the Great Clans see these Skaven as actual (if temporary) allies or as unwitting pawns likely depends on the size and strength of the Thrall Clan in question. Unsurprisingly, many of these Thrall Clans share the same ideology and goals of their masters, and their armies incorporate a disproportionate number of their patron’s weaponry, warriors, and war-beasts. These favours allow the lesser Thrall Clans to defeat their rivals and secure their own powerbase. </p>\n<p>Many Thrall Clans dwell in lairs and strongholds far from their masters’ eyes and have greater rein to pursue their own nefarious agendas. However, it is a foolish Thrall Clan that forgets its bonds of fealty altogether.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/wolf-rat.webp\" width=\"371\" height=\"320\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/clanrats.webp","folder":"mwbavITOKvFUhTrJ","sort":-300000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Multitudinous Clans","sort":-300000}}}

Its members, better known as the Warlock Engineers, constantly experiment to create newer and more powerful weapons of mass destruction. They often steal war machines from other species and strive to ‘improve’ them in their own unique way. This almost invariably involves the inclusion of Warpstone-based mechanisms that increase the weapons’ potential for destruction, but also tend to make them much more unstable. Other species would consider such weapons far too dangerous for large-scale use on the battlefield, but Skaven have a different attitude, accepting a few losses from their own weapons as normal.</p>\n<p>By selling the services of their specialised weapon teams to the constantly warring clans, the Masters of Clan Skryre have achieved an unparallelled level of influence and are, at the moment, the most prominent of the four greater clans.</p>\n<p>Power struggles drive competing Warlords to seek any advantage they can buy (although stealing and coercing are fine options too). At times, a mere show of might is enough to win the day. In this regard, a Warlord Clan cannot have too much of Clan Skryre’s wicked weaponry. The fact that the Warlock Engineers sell to all sides in the constant Skaven struggle for dominance is well known; the fact that for a very high price they offer to withhold their services is widely guessed. None but the Grey Seers know the exorbitant extent of Clan Skryre’s double-dealing and treachery.</p>\n<h3>The Horned Rat</h3>\n<p>It is Skaven nature to be terribly jealous of one’s peers, especially if they are overly successful. Even bearing that in mind, the bile and venom induced by Mallis Manrack’s sudden ascension has been astounding. Most considered his plan doomed to failure — albeit a spectacular one. Though the details of the intrigues that led to the @JournalEntry[b3IUWHv3Td9hFvKK]{Council of Thirteen} lending it their backing are not widely known, most of the clan’s Warlock Engineers had thought Lord Morskittar was just as dismissive of the plan.</p>\n<p>Clearly this was not the case, and despite any lingering misgivings, Clan Skryre aspire to capitalise on it as best they can. If the promised rain of Warpstone should fall upon the Middle Mountains, they intend to benefit from it more than most, as is only their right. If nothing else, a new and plentiful supply of Warpstone might diminish the influence granted to Clan Skryre from their hold over the rich veins beneath Skavenblight, and so they must act to maintain their position. More than one Clan Skryre digging machine stands ready to open tunnels to the Middle Mountains and the vast wealth that may soon be had there. Elsewhere in Clan Skryre, a few Warlock Engineers with more ‘fringe’ ideas have viewed @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Manrack’s} plan and come to the conclusion that it does not go nearly far enough.</p>\n<p>Clan Vrrtkin</p>\n<p>Clan Vrrtkin have been the thralls of Clan Skryre ever since the Second Great Civil War, pledging their armies in return for power and eventually a lair of their own. Armed with hundreds of Poisoned Wind Globadiers and mortar weapon teams, Clan Vrrtkin led many assaults and gassed many rival lairs. Indeed, such is their predilection to exterminating Skaven warrens with the deadly vapours that the glass orb is often displayed on the clan’s banners, warning enemies (and allies) not to stray too close. Unsurprisingly, the most sought-after item in Clan Vrrtkin is a gas mask. These inevitably go to the toughest warlords and Stormvermin first, with weaker Skaven fighting for what damaged and faulty equipment is left over. Most Clanrats have to make do with a urine-soaked bandage tied around their snout or else stuff rags up their nose to protect them should the wind change mid-battle.</p>\n<h3>The Turntails</h3>\n<p>The Turntails are Clan Vrrtkin’s longest-serving Clanrat regiment, having survived over thirty battles — more than any other Clawpack in living memory. This is due to the fact that the Turntails can run away from battle faster than any of their allies. Having fought for so long, the Warlord of Clan Vrrtkin mistakenly believes that the Turntails are formidable warriors and has granted them the use of several Clan Skryre weapon teams. The Turntails find these weapons exceptionally useful, especially when covering a retreat.</p>\n<h4>Using The Turntails</h4>\n<p>The Turntails bring some particularly devastating Skaven weaponry to the battlefield, and while discretion demands that these weapons are reserved for use only when the circumstances demand it, the Turntails are far more willing to risk exposing the carefully nurtured Skaven conspiracy if it means preserving their own lives. If you wish to present your Characters with a truly challenging opponent, a few well-placed Turntail weapon teams could prove particularly devastating.</p>\n<h4>The Turntails and Under-Middenheim</h4>\n<p>Clan Skryre’s long refusal to assist with the expansion of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim} is a source of great frustration to @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Gnawretch Skrray}. His continued pleas for support have grown tiresome to Lord Warlock Morskittar, and most of his missives and their accompanying gifts of Warpstone have been intercepted by underlings. The leadership of Clan Vrrtkin are aware of this situation and have despatched the Turntails to @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim} in order for the highly ‘capable’ warband to inspect its security and seize it for Clan Vrrtkin — with Clan Skryre’s permission, of course. The Characters could easily encounter the Turntails during the course of one of these inspections, should they venture too far beneath the city.</p>\n<h4>The Turntails and Clan Mange</h4>\n<p>The Turntails would see little to gain in aiding Clan Mange, and even less in attacking Brass Keep. Should they somehow get involved, they would be among the first to flee, likely some leagues before reaching the keep itself.</p>\n<h4>The Turntails and the Cult of the Yellow Fang</h4>\n<p>The Turntails have occasionally made use of the Yellow Fang to gather information on the state of engineering in the Empire, in the hopes of learning some useful titbit that might gain them further favour within Clan Skryre. </p>\n<h4>The Turntails and Mallis Manrack</h4>\n<p>The Turntails may be offered to @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Manrack} as suitable experienced guards, and would add a good deal of firepower to the defence of Karak Skygg. However, the group has been given secret orders from rival Warlock Engineers to steal the plans to the weapon and kill Manrack if his plan actually succeeds, ensuring that he does not go on to rise too far within Clan Skryre. They may be encountered throughout Karak Skygg rummaging through drawings, interrogating prisoners, or otherwise failing to guard whatever it is they have been assigned to protect.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[VlJVksg9pFTHUcx7]{Turntail Clanrat}</h4>\n<h4>@Actor[cHwT8IHZLqi3x8Ra]{Turntail Poisoned Wind Globadiers}</h4>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/clan-vrrtkin.webp\" width=\"391\" height=\"534\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/banner-skyre.webp","folder":"mwbavITOKvFUhTrJ","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Multitudinous Clans","sort":0}}}

During the first meeting, give the Characters a chance to find a clue, but not to catch the rat. If they pass a <strong>Hard (–10) Perception</strong> Test they notice the pungent whiff of rat, and if they investigate they find a pile of droppings behind some ledgers on a shelf in the office. The droppings are grey and oddly oily. </p>\n<p>If @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} is made aware of this, he curses the damn vermin.

It immediately attempts to flee when discovered. Characters who want to catch it will either have to kill it at range or chase it (handle this as a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.03r3y37RFKAFM82c]{Pursuit}, the @Actor[8HeX6KR3xhVg0Zl4]{Akoustikk Ratty} has a head start of 2 and if the Pursuit is inconclusive after 4 rounds the Akoustikk Ratty finds a hole in the skirting and escapes).</p>\n<p>If caught or killed, the Characters find a red button on its posterior, just beneath the base of its tail. If pressed, the Characters hear a slightly garbled rendition of their most recent conversation. If the Characters dig deeper into the rat, they discover a tiny, weird green crystal grafted into its skull (handling this shard of Warpstone counts as @Corruption[minor]{minor exposure to Corruption}). The rat’s insides are a mess of innards, and intricate and complicated clockwork wheels and cogs. </p>\n<p>The remains of Akoustikk Ratty Mk2 will be of great interest to those who delve into the myth of the Ratmen, such as @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Professor Hasche} of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, who performs a detailed examination of the corpse if it is gifted to her.

{"_id":"Pgv8BiaRz1f7mvzQ","name":"Welcome to Deff Batz Country","content":"<p>The Deff Batz are a tribe of Night Goblins who have suffered hard times recently. They are vassals of the Red Tusk Orcs whose territory is upon the south west slopes of the Middle Mountains. But they are not valued vassals, and when they began to suffer from the depredations of the Skaven at Karak Skygg, their Orc masters were unwilling to come to their rescue. The remaining Deff Batz have become even more belligerent and resentful than they used to be, which is some feat given that they were thoroughly horrible to begin with.</p>\n<p>The first sign of trouble is a large post by the side of a mountain path. The post is topped with the dried heads of three humans and a pair of Dwarfs. There is a board attached to the sign with crude runes etched onto it (it reads ‘turn back now and we might not eat you’ in badly formed Khazalid).</p>\n<p>If the Characters move on, a small figure appears on top of a crag about 120 yards further up the pass. He is clearly a Night Goblin, and whilst he is small and far away, his shrill voice carries clearly in the mountain air.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Hoy! Didja see dat sign? Didja see it? Dat means stay off our zoggin’ mountain! Stay zoggin’ off it!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is @Actor[2QxIDdmhyZYizZk5]{Bartog the Naff}, chief diplomat of the Deff Batz. The Characters must decide quickly how they are going to react.</p>\n<p><strong>Retreat</strong>: Hostilities cease if the Characters retreat, but recommence if they return.</p>\n<p><strong>Attack</strong>: The characters may attack Bartog. If they can kill him quickly from afar, this is an effective way to deal with him. However, unless he is killed straight away, he drops down from his perch, and scampers off to rouse @Actor[Typ9d3Sfowozqx9l]{Scuttlescree} the Troll.</p>\n<p><strong>Negotiate</strong>: The Characters can try and reason with Bartog, but this is unlikely to bear fruit, he is belligerent and insulting, even against his own self-interest. If any spells, miracles, or manoeuvres are made during negotiations, Bartog runs to wake up @Actor[Typ9d3Sfowozqx9l]{Scuttlescree}. Typical responses to requests include:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘I sed zog off yoo stoopid ’umie! We don’t wants yor stink up ’ere!’</p>\n<p>‘Eivver zog off rite now or I’ll go fetch Scuttlescree, an den I’ll ’ave woteva ‘e don’t eat!’</p>\n<p>‘Stoopid ’umie gitz, yoo just wanna come in ’ere an ruin evryfingk, well I sez zog off!’</p>\n<p>‘Oo wants yor stoopid stinkin’ gold? No use ta gobbos. Stick it where it ‘urts and zog right off!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Trading with Bartog</h4>\n<p>There is one way to get Bartog to allow the Characters to move through Deff Batz territory, and that is to offer him something he wants. Bartog, like most Goblins, is interested in two things: equipment that can be used to cause mayhem, and strong drink.</p>\n<p>If the Characters offer Bartog weaponry or booze for the privilege of crossing Deff Batz territory, he will still be sneering and aggressive, but is basically honourable. For example, if the Characters were to suggest that they have a keg of ale and a cache of cinder blasts to offer for safe passage, Bartog’s response would be along the lines of:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Ugh it’ll ’ave yor slime all over it! But leave that stuff by the post, and we’ll let yoo over da mountain, but mind you go fast as yoo can, we don’t wants yer stinkin’ the place aht.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Provided the Characters are able to produce enough weaponry and/or booze to impress Bartog. (Note: He is interested in quantity than quality, though weapons that produce explosions are particularly prized.) However, Bartog does not trade if there are any Dwarfs in the party.</p>\n<p>As the Characters pass through Deff Batz territory after a trade, they may see the occasional Night Goblin keeping watch on them, but the agreement is honoured and they may pass through unmolested as long as they don’t complicate matters themselves.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img style=\"transform:scaleX(-1)\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/stone-troll.webp\" width=\"293\" height=\"396\" /></div>\n<h4>Waking Scuttlescree</h4>\n<p>Bartog is well placed to abandon his position by sliding down a slope on the far side of the crag which ends at the mouth of a cave. Within the cave sleeps @Actor[Typ9d3Sfowozqx9l]{Scuttlescree}, a particularly malign and ornery Stone Troll.</p>\n<p>@Actor[Typ9d3Sfowozqx9l]{Scuttlescree} proceeds to exit his cave and sniffs the air. He can track Characters by smell, and attacks them in an animal frenzy. Scuttlescree is hungry and enraged. He fights to the death but may be persuaded to abandon the fight if he is given something significant to eat (such as a horse or a dead Character). In the meantime, Bartog slips away into the mountains.</p>\n<h4>A Beating in the Peaks</h4>\n<p>If Bartog is not satisfied or killed he rouses more of his tribe to set an ambush for the Characters. A few hours after they encountered him, during a spell of fair weather, the Characters hear an incongruous rumble of thunder echo across the rocky valleys and crevasses. Loose pebbles shower down on their heads. If a Character passes a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test they may notice that there does not seem to be a cloud in the sky, or any evidence of oncoming landslides.</p>\n<p>Up ahead of the Characters is the wide mouth of a natural cave. They may think to take shelter within, either to escape the elements, or to bed down for the night, or just out of idle curiosity. However, the cave is a trap. A Character passing an <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test notices that a net containing many large stones has been hoisted over the cave mouth.</p>\n<p>But the sound isn’t coming from the skies at all, and the second, much louder rumble erupts from deeper within the cave. There’s no mistaking it now; the sound is the beating of mighty drums. Any Character who passes an <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test can feel a light draught of air coming from deeper in the caves, indicating there is another exit. If they get 4+SL, they also hear high pitched cackling coming from within the cave.</p>\n<p>The ground shakes, and the stones in the net are released. The cave entrance is blocked up as rocks and earth tumble down. Characters and animals standing at the entrance risk being struck as if caught in a landslide. The Characters have been trapped by the Goblins, who wait in a larger cave further into the mountain, hoping to use their numbers to their advantage. They are confident the Characters cannot pass the blockage and have no choice but to pass by their carefully prepared forces.</p>\n<p>Resourceful Characters may be able to clear the blockage after all. It is certainly difficult, but not impossible for a strong party. Using physical force to move the boulder requires 6SL on an <strong>Extended Very Hard (–30) Athletics</strong> Test, and the tunnel is too narrow to allow more than two Characters (one making the roll and the other lending aid). Each roll represents 5 minutes of the Characters straining to shift rocks and earth. Alternatively, a suitably devastating spell could clear the blockage. Smaller Magic Missile spells such as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.gJYXrZa4pW49R9Vu]{Blast} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.QmjYLCaEn3YKHxdv]{Bolt} are too weak, but <em>Ghur’s </em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.LTUC1fqIuuGSUaQ1]{Amber Spear}, or <em>Aqshy’s </em>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.HpFkVJ2lYPAWumUL]{Great Fires of U’Zhul} are poweful enough to shatter, melt or otherwise shift the blockage. Any damaging spell with an Area of Effect and a CN of 8+ should be sufficient, but if Characters come up with particularly creative magic or other solutions by all means allow it. If the Characters go this route, the Goblins give chase, leading to combat regardless, but the narrow paths and dangerous terrain cost them their advantage in numbers.</p>\n<p>If the Characters journey into the cave they must meet the Goblin horde head on. Further down the cramped, twisting tunnel is a large cavern. There are 16 Goblins waiting in ambush, but the enthusiastic drumming has made it obvious there is a fight waiting for the Characters. The Goblins are confident in their numbers at first, but flee as soon as they lose half their number. The Characters might cut them down as they flee, or they may escape down narrow tunnels, either way once they are defeated the Goblins do not trouble the Characters further.</p>\n<p>After the fight Characters might want to investigate the bodies. A Character passing a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test can deduce that the Goblin bodies are all showing signs of malnourishment. Goblin bones can be seen here and there in the lair they were using, suggesting that they have been engaging in cannibalism.</p>\n<p>The tunnel continues on for several hundred yards before the Characters emerge into the fresh air and open sky once more.</p>\n<h4>Rewards</h4>\n<p>Good roleplaying and clever thinking should be rewarded, but there are additional XP for the following: </p>\n<p>@Exp[30, Crossed Deff Bats Territory]{30 points for crossing Deff Bats Territory}</p>\n<p>@Exp[20, Faced a Hazard]{20 points for each hazard faced}</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/stone-troll.webp","folder":null,"sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Into the Middle Mountains","sort":300000}}}

From Middenheim, the road leads through Hovelhoff, Hohenfahrt and Lindenheim, and from there into the mountains via Ferlangst Tower, Mittler Castle, and Hope Square to the Picket.</p>\n<p>Before setting out, the Characters are given horses (bearing the city brand), if they need them. They also have the Charter given to them by Katarina, bearing the Todbringer seal. It commands all loyal subjects, servants and officers of the Graf to allow the party to pass and not obstruct them. It does not command anyone to help them though: they must accomplish their mission themselves. Illiterate folk of the Grand Duchy of Middenheim are impressed by the seal, and might be talked into giving assistance; but those who can read study the document, then do the absolute minimum to comply with its demands.</p>\n<p>The road from Middenheim to Hovelhof runs north-east from the base of the Fauschlag. A road runs east from Hovelhof to Hohenfahrt.  This road continues through the Middle Mountain foothills through Lindenheim and on to Ferlangst Tower. This outpost marks the border of the Kärzburdger estate, and is the best place to rest before the terrain becomes mountainous. From there the Characters can strike out past the ruins of Mittler Castle. The penitentiary at Hope Square is the last place to find shelter before reaching the Picket.</p>\n<p>If the Characters want to push on as fast as possible, they do not need to stop at every location, and benefit from the fact that they likely reach the picket ahead of any Yellow Fang agents or rumours of their activities. However, they are more likely to suffer @Condition[Fatigued] conditions. Ask the Characters if they want to make each stage of the journey at full pelt, or at an easy pace.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE ROAD TO BRASS KEEP</em></h3>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:68px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:6.10561%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong><em>Stage</em></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong><em>Point of Interest</em></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:36.3091%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong><em>Riding Full Pelt</em></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:24.252%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong><em>Easy Pace</em></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:6.10561%;height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>1</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;height:17px\">\n<p><em>Middenheim – Hovelhof – Hohenfahrt </em></p>\n<p><em>It is about 10 miles to Hovelhof and then a further 25 to Hohenfahrt, on decent roads with no sharp inclines.</em></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:36.3091%;height:17px\"><em>It takes 1 day to reach Hohenfahrt.

If any of these Yellow Fang members are still at large when the Characters leave for the Picket, they congregate together with two Sewer Jacks from @Actor[uL6CLyF3u6QpRDQ9]{Raina’s} patrol, acquire horses and give chase to the Characters, hoping to overtake them.</p>\n<p>The Yellow Fang group are a day behind the Characters. They ride hard, making Hohenfahrt the evening of the first day, and Ferlangst Tower on the late afternoon of the second. On the third day they reach Hope Square. However, during their journey one of their horses becomes badly winded between Mittler Castle and Hope Square. The Yellow Fang waylay a wagon returning from delivering supplies to Hope Square in order to get replacement mounts.</p>\n<p>If the Yellow Fang have overtaken the party then the Characters pass the bloody results of their activity. The cart, the bodies of the drovers, and the corpse of the lamed horse have all been pushed off the road into the valley below. Blood stains remain however, and can be seen by any Character who passes an <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test. Once they are spotted any Character looking where they lead sees the wrecked cart and corpses.</p>\n<p>The Yellow Fang arrive at the Picket around noon of the fourth day of their trip. This means they arrive one day behind the Characters, if the Characters moved as quickly as possible. </p>\n<p>If the Characters moved at an easy pace, it is likely that the Yellow Fang overtake them during the journey. This could happen in one of two ways.</p>\n<p>If the Yellow Fang arrives at a settlement or coaching inn at which the Characters are staying, they do not stop. They know the Characters have a certain degree of authority due to the Todbringers’ patronage, so they fear that assailing the Characters in any way would rouse bystanders. So, in this circumstance the Yellow Fang ride on through the night. This is an exhausting regimen, and if the Characters confront them later on Yellow Fang members who made the journey suffer from a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition.</p>\n<p>If the Yellow Fang catch up with the Characters on the road, they initially hang back and try to appraise the situation. Allow the Characters to make Perception Tests (difficulty depending on how vigilant they are being). If they pass, they see a group of horsemen trying to keep out of sight on the road behind them.</p>\n<p>What occurs next depends on the disposition of the party. The Yellow Fang are not skilled fighters, and they know that the Characters are capable individuals, so they avoid a fair fight. They wait until the Characters stop for the night and then overtake, or may use what magic and other skills are at their disposal to hurt and inconvenience the Characters. If they follow the Characters to Mittler Castle they try to ambush them individually during the night.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>EVIDENCE OF IGNORANCE</em></h3>\n<p><em>Depending on how well the Characters have been doing, the Yellow Fang may be in a better or worse position to confront them.

{"_id":"QcVM1YRuOEjblPll","name":"The Pestilent Brotherhood","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/banner-pestilens.webp\" width=\"263\" height=\"293\" /></div>\n<p>Clan Pestilens are best known for the Plague Monks that make up an important sub faction within the clan. They are disciples of disease and decay, and the harbingers of plague. Centuries ago, a Skaven expedition ventured into the steaming jungles of Lustria, only to be decimated by virulent tropical diseases and the reptilian warriors who defend that land. The few survivors hid in the ruins of a temple they had discovered in the depths of the jungle. There they unearthed ancient secrets that should have been left undisturbed. Perhaps it was because of the knowledge they chanced upon, or perhaps their destiny was decreed by the Horned Rat, but these Skaven mysteriously began to revere the very diseases that were slowly killing them. A strange new breed of Skaven was born: the Plague Monks of Clan Pestilens. Constantly plague-ridden, they were capable of withstanding their diseases as long as they remained devoted to their festering god.</p>\n<p>Soon the Plague Monks started to expand and the delirious ferocity of Clan Pestilens became legendary among their enemies. The first to suffer at their pox-ridden hands were the Lizardmen. Several of their cities were wiped out by lethal plagues until powerful magic unleashed by the Slann forced the clan to retreat. The majority abandoned Lustria and escaped to the Southlands, where they settled in the dark rainforests. From there they started to move north, spreading disease in their wake, until they reached the Old World.</p>\n<p>When their emissaries reached Skavenblight, they attempted to rejoin Skavendom. At first, they were refused a seat in the Council of Thirteen, which resulted in a bitter civil war. The power of Clan Pestilens, supported by those clans who did not agree with the Council’s policies, almost triumphed over the Lords of Decay. The Skaven population was devastated by the war and pestilence unleashed by the Plague Monks in their wrath. Finally, the Lords of Decay agreed that Clan Pestilens had proved their right to have a seat on the council and the clan agreed to put its powers at the service of the Thirteen.Their monomaniacal zeal and devotion makes Clan Pestilens the most single-minded of all the Skaven clans. They are different, counted strange by all other ratmen. This absolute belief in their own righteousness has caused untold friction amongst Warlord and Greater Clans alike. Recognised as a major power, Clan Pestilens has a high seat amongst the Lords of Decay, having risen from the seventh to the tenth position. It is no secret, however, that many scheme to have the diseased ones destroyed. These plots have lurked in the shadows since Clan Pestilens nearly overthrew the council.</p>\n<p>Ceaseless faith and an arsenal of diseases have not only helped Clan Pestilens survive, but have seen their influence grow. In recent centuries, Clan Pestilens have spread from their mysterious Southlands strongholds as far as the Vaults and even the Grey Mountains. During the civil wars, many sided with Clan Pestilens, but it was always unclear which were the true thralls and which were merely fair-weather allies. Many Warlord Clans continue to claim allegiance to Clan Pestilens, most notably Clans Skrat, Septik, Morbidus, and Gratzz.</p>\n<h3>Role in The Horned Rat</h3>\n<p>Arch Plaguelord Nurglitch VII was one of the @JournalEntry[b3IUWHv3Td9hFvKK]{Council of Thirteen} who voted in favour of @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Maliss Manrack’s} proposal. However, he did so late in the day and only after the provocations of Lord Gnawdwell. The Plaguelord is never quite trusted by the other Lords of Decay, for whilst Clan Pestilens are a significant power within Skaven society, they are known to harbour many magic users in defiance of the Horned Rat’s will; and their plagues often go out of control and decimate the Under-Empire (on occasion outbreaks seem more than accidental). </p>\n<p>Many of the practices and rites utilised by Clan Pestilens are similar to those employed by followers of the Chaos God Nurgle, and rumours that inner echelons of the clan are followers of the Plague Lord rather than the Horned Rat are regularly circulated (not least by the Grey Seers). No hard evidence can ever be brought before the Council, however.</p>\n<p>Arch Plaguelord Nurglitch VII has his powerbase far to the south of the Old World, in the steaming jungles and malarial swamps of the Southlands. He would have to work hard to benefit directly from the rain of Warpstone meteors that will shower down over the northern Empire if Project Moonbreaker is a success. However, some members of the Pestilent Brotherhood have their centres of operation closer to the site. These include Clan Morbidus, but they are a serious asset to Clan Pestilens as their Warlord sits on the @JournalEntry[b3IUWHv3Td9hFvKK]{Council of Thirteen} (and reliably supports Nurglitch in council meetings). Clan Septik, who are loyal enough to be trusted, but not so powerful that they would be missed, are being considered to act as Nurglitch’s proxies on Project Moonbreaker.</p>\n<h3>Clan Septik</h3>\n<p>Clan Septik swore fealty to Clan Pestilens during the first great Skaven Civil War. They are the most fanatical believers in the entire Pestilent Brotherhood, rabid zealots whose fervour rivals (and possibly exceeds) that of their Clan Pestilens masters. Clan Septik see themselves as the right claw of Clan Pestilens, who have thus far encouraged this view — after all, you can never have enough devout troops willing to fight and die for your cause. </p>\n<p>Despite the casual way in which this Thrall Clan is thrown into battle, they have so far always emerged relatively intact, leading many to believe that the Horned Rat himself is looking favourably upon Clan Septik. The warriors of Clan Septik utilise robes and banners of an off-white colour to better show their disgusting collection of filthy stains. These Skaven wield weapons and armour corroded with rust (the rustier the better), and their bodies are covered in dirty bandages draped over weeping sores. The diseased claw is a common icon amongst the Skaven of Clan Septik.</p>\n<h3>Blightskab’s Plaguepack</h3>\n<p>Blightskab’s Plaguepack are amongst Clan Septik’s most disgusting warriors. Their fur is matted with contagions and their skin covered with boils and buboes. Blightskab commands his regiment with hacking, phlegm-filled shouts. He is so eager to spread disease in the name of the Horned Rat that he has even been known to lead his regiment from the front! The Plaguepack are believed to have been responsible for the outbreak of @Item[tsmjTOn7LOo12Hlr]{Bleeding Eyerot} that recently swept through the city of Nuln. </p>\n<h4>@Actor[ICPd8EuBiKru0hVf]{Blightskab — Plague Priest}</h4>\n<h4>@Actor[1bwGIpGk5cymKyKE]{Diseased Clanrat}</h4>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>BLIGHTSKAB’S MOTIVATIONS</em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Spread Bleeding Eyerot<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Raise Clan Septik in the eyes of Clan Pestilens<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Raise Clan Pestilens in the eyes of the Council<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Destroy the enemies of Clan Pestilens<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Confront and destroy those who call Clan Pestilens heretical<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Discover if Clan Pestilens is heretical, and if so find out if this might be beneficial</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Using Blightskab’s Plaguepack</h4>\n<p>Middenheim presents Blightskab’s Plaguepack with a perfect environment to unleash another epidemic of their signature disease, Bleeding Eyerot. The packed Human city is a ripe breeding ground for contagion and Clan Pestilens are eager to see an experimental strain unleashed there. They may send out the Plaguepack as agents to unleash the disease upon Middenheimers.</p>\n<p>There are a number of obstacles to bypass in infecting Middenheim. The first of these is that the inhabitants do not access their water from any one source, but from a number of springs and wells throughout the city. The cult of Shallya has a strong presence in Middenheim, and the city’s @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.fofmTR3LuoaMVLa0]{Komission for Public Works} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.ySq4ZdlPcedXGnS0]{Physician’s Guild} are also keen to show themselves vigilant and effective in containing outbreaks, so the corruption of any one water supply, or city district, will soon be identified and dealt with. </p>\n<p>But the greatest obstacle comes from Under-Middenheim itself. Clan Mors rule here, and will not brook a challenge to their supremacy. </p>\n<h4>Blightskab and Under-Middenheim</h4>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.6FPPs62CQl2IRMJl]{Kanker Fett} is one of the three Skaven who wield most power in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim} and desires to spread disease in the city above. Warlord-Castellan @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Gnawretch Skrray} has thus far kept Fett’s ambition in check. The arrival of the Plaguepack threatens to tip the balance of power in Clan Pestilens’s favour. Gnawretch Skrray will not allow this to happen if he can help it.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.6FPPs62CQl2IRMJl]{Fett} desires to make an alliance with the Plaguepack and, when suddenly outnumbered, hopes @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Gnawretch Skrray} will be cunning enough to make a public show of his support for any project the Plaguepack wish to embark upon.</p>\n<p>In a secret effort to maintain his power, Gnawretch may even go so far as to give enemies of the Skaven, such as the Characters, clues to the Plaguepack’s activities, hoping that they can be done away with without leaving any evidence implicating his own involvement.</p>\n<h4>Blightskab and Clan Mange</h4>\n<p>The Plaguepack may assist Clan Mange in return for Warptokens, but @Actor[ICPd8EuBiKru0hVf]{Blightskab} is much too clever to help attack Brass Keep. The Plaguepack may try to enslave surviving Clan Mange Clanrats after the attack on Brass Keep. </p>\n<h4>Blightskab and the Cult of the Yellow Fang</h4>\n<p>The Plaguepack are not aware that Human agents work for the Skaven and would merely see Yellow Fang members as potential test subjects.</p>\n<h4>Blightskab and @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Maliss Manrack}</h4>\n<p>The Plaguepack are unaware of the existence of any operation at Karak Skygg. Blightskab is a canny Skaven, and if he comes to learn about the Moonbreaker Cannon, he realises straight away that interfering with this plan will make him too many important enemies. He considers it best to stay loyal to Clan Pestilens and leave the Warlock Engineers to their own devices.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, @Actor[ICPd8EuBiKru0hVf]{Blightskab} quickly leaves the area if he finds out about the plot to blow up Morrslieb, and heads to the Southlands to make a report to the Masters of Clan Pestilens.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/clan-septic.webp\" width=\"340\" height=\"419\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/banner-pestilens.webp","folder":"mwbavITOKvFUhTrJ","sort":-25000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Multitudinous Clans","sort":-25000}}}

If you wish to set this adventure in Altdorf, the shadier parts of @Compendium[wfrp4e-altdorf.altdorf-journals.4YsFyNKWos4jMltD]{The East End} would work.</p>\n<p>As the Characters head towards their destination, they have to run a heavy gauntlet of beggars and pickpockets. However, once they reach the @Scene[AAw29guxisllLXiK]{Street} containing number 12, the area becomes suspiciously empty. The locals know something is going on at number 17 — they always know something’s up in this kind of situation — and the grapevine says it’s unhealthy to linger in that neighbourhood just now.</p>\n<p>Once inside number 12, @Actor[qvHgWQ8HF3rn003M]{Alphonse} leads the Characters upstairs and gives them their assignments. He says that the kidnappers are holed up in number 17 across the street.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>WE KICK IN THE DOOR</em></h3>\n<p><em>@Actor[qvHgWQ8HF3rn003M]{Alphonse} painfully reminds the Characters that simply rushing in will put Sigismund’s life at risk. If they do not seem to care for the damage this would do to Alphonse’s reputation (the chief negative outcome that springs to his mind), he also points out that they will not get paid and, incidentally, will have the blood of an innocent young man on their hands. Not to mention the father’s wrath. </em></p>\n<p><em>However, some groups will insist on taking the direct approach. If they are indiscreet, the kidnappers waste no time in both defending themselves and heading to the cellar to do away with Sigismund should any Characters make it that far. They are quite willing to kill their hostage if it comes to it — after all, threats are only worth making if you mean to follow through.</em></p>\n<p><em>Even if this reckless plan succeeds — and it shouldn’t — @Actor[qvHgWQ8HF3rn003M]{Alphonse} will be furious at the risks they took, and will pay them only if threatened with violence.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One Character is to watch the front of the house through the telescope (carefully surrounded by drawn curtains), while the others are to find a vantage point from which they can spy on the back of the house. They are to carefully note down (or remember, if none are literate) any arrivals and departures, plus anything they can see going on inside. Under no circumstances are they to do anything to make the kidnappers suspicious.</p>\n<p>@Actor[qvHgWQ8HF3rn003M]{Alphonse} is off to check some other leads concerning the kidnappers’ criminal associates, and will return at midnight to take their reports.</p>\n<h3>The Telescope</h3>\n<p>The Character at the telescope has the easy job; all they have to do is stay awake and avoid falling out of the window. If the Character does not have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write} Talent, insist that they do not take any notes themselves, but commit the various comings and goings of the kidnappers to memory for their report to @Actor[qvHgWQ8HF3rn003M]{Alphonse}.</p>\n<p>The Character at the scope can see the front door and into bedroom 1 and bedroom 3 on the first floor. On first inspection, they note that all other visible windows are shuttered, and the front door is in good condition. On a successful <strong>Average (+20) Perception </strong>Test, the Character notices that there is a skylight on the roof, which appears warped and slightly cracked.</p>\n<h4>The Rear</h4>\n<p>One or more Characters will have to find a good spot to watch the rear of number 17. Sensible precautions, such as moving stealthily, finding a good disguise, and a plausible excuse to be in the area if questioned, are required to avoid trouble. Characters who fail to take proper care, or who try to get too close to the house, should be chased off by Frau Koch from number 19, who has a mean temper and wields a rolling pin to match (see @JournalEntry[n6ukj2PAV0fL3qmC]{The Kidnappers' Plan})!</p>\n<p>There are several good places from which to spy on the back of the house, including an obviously abandoned tenement directly behind number 17. The privy — mere feet from number 17’s own outhouse — is even better, although a lot less comfortable for a spy. From their vantage points, the Characters can see the front and back of the house, into the kitchen on the ground floor, and the three bedrooms on the second. All other rooms have curtains drawn, apart from the broken skylight to the attic. Just what can be seen by keeping watch is covered in @JournalEntry[n6ukj2PAV0fL3qmC]{The Surveillance} below.</p>\n<p>See also <strong>Sneaking About In Other People’s Backyards </strong>(below) for how to handle the Characters’ movements during their surveillance. </p>\n<h3>The Inhabitants</h3>\n<p>There are six kidnappers, one ill-tempered dog, and one unhappy son in the house. @Actor[comd8h9fa4Kl0D4P]{Claudia Carbonetti}, the mastermind of the operation, is vicious, evil, and cunning. Her right-hand thug, @Actor[IZtbzNLfSa27EWPw]{Paolo Gentile}, is a mindless sadist who worships Claudia and unhesitatingly follows her orders to the letter. The others in the gang (@Actor[itzmGGCtBLD9vWeC]{Knud}, @Actor[BG2mxjsYI1L0OvaL]{Britta}, @Actor[u6aqv6Tplpoh81Mg]{Ilona}, and @Actor[GaDt44ecicgBLDea]{Mikhail}), are muscle hired specifically for this job. They follow Claudia’s orders mainly because they are well paid, and they know what Paolo will do to them if they don’t. Even so, they have no particular desire to die for 5 shillings a day, and of course are seen as entirely disposable by Claudia and Paolo.</p>\n<p>@Actor[Qi0tp86o0gJnohzN]{Giuseppe the dog} is @Actor[comd8h9fa4Kl0D4P]{Claudia’s} pet. A Tilean Manhound, Giuseppe is about as friendly and playful as a hungry Squig. The unfortunate victim Sigismund is tied hand and foot in the basement, and wishes he were anywhere else.</p>\n<h3>Sneaking About In Other People’s Backyards</h3>\n<p>While the Characters are performing surveillance on the kidnappers’ hideout, use Opposed Skill Tests to see whether they are spotted by any of the kidnappers or their neighbours (See @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.FpXNI4DNMqYwFi1h]{Tests} for guidance on Opposed Skill Tests). The Tests vary depending on the time of day and the Characters’ Skills.</p>\n<h4>By Day</h4>\n<p>If a Character is acting suspiciously, is somewhere they shouldn’t be, or might otherwise draw attention, any guards should make an opposed <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test resisted by the Character’s <strong>Challenging (+0) Stealth (Urban)</strong> Test. This Test may become easier for the Character if they have taken efforts to disguise themselves or otherwise make themselves look like they fit in.</p>\n<p>For example, they might dress as a beggar in a doorway nearby, or pass the house in the guise of a pie seller. In these cases, they may well draw the attention of the kidnappers or their neighbours, but this doesn’t give the game away: they may just be told to move on, or asked for a pie, depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<h4>By Night</h4>\n<p>NPCs who are sleeping, drunk, or otherwise not paying attention must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test at night, resisted by an <strong>Average (+20) Stealth</strong> Test, as it is generally much easier to sneak about at night. Some disguises will draw less attention at night, such as a Character pretending to be a drunken reveller relieving themselves in an alley. Others will be less effective — there are very few pie sellers who would brave @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} after dark.</p>\n<h3>Messing About On Rooftops (Night Only)</h3>\n<p>Houses in the area are either two or three storeys high. Two-storey houses are 6 yards high, whereas three-storey houses are 9 yards high. </p>\n<h4>Climbing</h4>\n<p>A <strong>Difficult (–10) Climb</strong> Test is sufficient to get atop a two-storey building, while a <strong>Hard (–20) Climb</strong> Test is required for a three-storey house. This difficulty may be lowered if the Characters have the right equipment or Talents, such as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.MGEPI4jNhymNIRVz]{Scale Sheer Surface} or a good length of rope and grapple.</p>\n<p>Most buildings are scalable on the corners, where rickety drain pipes provide enough purchase to make the attempt. The flat front or side of a building requires the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.MGEPI4jNhymNIRVz]{Scale Sheer Surface} Talent to attempt at the modifiers above.</p>\n<p>The fences between the backyards of buildings require a <strong>Challenging (+0) Climb</strong> Test to vault.</p>\n<p>You may find the rules on @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.1gNxlCdPV1C3oZ6Z]{jumping and falling} to be of use should the Characters slip up when attempting to move between roofs.</p>\n<h4>Making Noise</h4>\n<p>The slates on houses in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} are never new and rarely secure, and the patter of even small feet can sound incredibly loud when it is coming from the ceiling right above one’s head. Remember to Test against the Perception of anyone sleeping in a house the Characters climb, even if they are otherwise being extremely quiet. To most citizens, it is quite obvious when something a good deal heavier than a pigeon is traipsing across their roof.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-candle.webp\" width=\"170\" height=\"196\" /></div>","folder":"iPFjTnKXVnElPe6X","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"A Little Help From My (New) Friends","sort":100000}}}

The clan’s influence is so great that it consumes war-beasts and weapon teams from many lesser clans, and its ranks are bolstered by their warriors — hired, bribed, or coerced to fight in the first wave. Clan Mors’s rise in power, size, and status is due in no small part to taking the Dwarf stronghold of Karak Eight Peaks, known to the Skaven as the City of Pillars — a major nexus for the passageways that make up the Under-Empire. Clan Mors’s aggressive warriors bear many trophy scars and have better weaponry and more armour than other Skaven, the spoils looted over many long campaigns. The upper levels of the City of Pillars are constantly assailed by vengeful Dwarf warbands and spiteful Night Goblin tribes. This provides Clan Mors with a brutal proving ground for its chieftains, and a chance to grind the teeth of a growing cadre of elite warriors.</p>\n<h3>Fangsnapper’s Clawpack</h3>\n<p>The battle-hardened @Actor[u66iYrXRTW15bkTI]{Clanrats of Fangsnapper’s Clawpack} led the assault that retook several vaults from the Night Goblins in the City of Pillars, and they were instrumental in Clan Mors’s victory over Clan Corpulent. @Actor[PZq9H0Iw8rgeFmyk]{Scrak Fangsnapper} rose to command the Clawpack during the sacking of the Empire town of Buchendorf when Scrak throttled his predecessor with his own tail. Since then he has defeated over a dozen potential rivals, and their broken fangs hang from his trophy rock as a warning to other would-be usurpers.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[PZq9H0Iw8rgeFmyk]{Scrak Fangsnapper}</h4>\n<h4>@Actor[u66iYrXRTW15bkTI]{Clan Mors Clanrat}</h4>\n<h3>Using Fangsnapper’s Clawpack</h3>\n<p>Fangsnapper’s Clawpack is a straightforward foe, more suited to fighting on the subterranean battlefields of the City of Pillars than any sort of subterfuge or complicated mission. However, they might just be despatched to make life complicated for @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack}.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FANGSNAPPER’S MOTIVATIONS</em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Survive the Under-Empire<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Perform well, but not so well that he gains a reputation<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Seem to be obedient and humble<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Carry out Gnawdwell’s orders<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Seek an opportunity to find a new master<br /><br /></em></li>\n<li><em>Seek an opportunity to find an environment safe from Gnawdwell</em></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Clan Mors and Under-Middenheim</h4>\n<p>Clan Mors has little to do with @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim} and tends to stay away from the city for fear of upsetting Castellan-Warlord @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Gnawretch Skrray} and his master, Warlord General Paskrit the Vast. Whilst Lord Gnawdwell of Clan Mors occupies a more powerful seat on the council, the Warlord-General could potentially muster a number of smaller clans to any cause he thought worth protecting, and their combined might in coalition against Clan Mors could lead to a sudden reversal of Gnawdwell’s fortunes.</p>\n<p>But perhaps Gnawdwell might see the current situation as a way to ingratiate himself with the Warlord General, by placing @Actor[PZq9H0Iw8rgeFmyk]{Fangsnapper} in the service of Under-Middenheim. With such an experienced regiment at his command, Castellan-Warlord @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Gnawretch Skrray} could soon start policing the movements of other clans and requisitioning even more Warpstone (and other resources) to gain an advantage. Fangsnapper might well jump at the chance to help garrison a lair far away from the envious eyes of Warlord Queek.</p>\n<h4>Clan Mors and Clan Mange</h4>\n<p>Were Clan Mange to come into an unexpected source of wealth, it might hire Fangsnapper’s Clawpack to help assault Brass Keep. Even Clan Mors’s fiercest warriors would not fare well against the @Actor[MWUYvCCpNwg6eosZ]{Blight Lords} though, and the demise of the Clawpack would be a serious setback to Clan Mors’s military efforts. </p>\n<h4>Clan Mors and the Cult of the Yellow Fang</h4>\n<p>The Fangpack have no involvement with the Yellow Fang. The only knowledge they have about dealing with Humans is how to kill them. </p>\n<h4>Clan Mors and @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack}</h4>\n<p>The Clawpack are aware that a plot to blow up part of Morrslieb has been permitted by order of the @JournalEntry[b3IUWHv3Td9hFvKK]{Council of Thirteen}. Lord Gnawdwell is still resentful that the Council sanctioned Project Moonbreaker but, like all members of the Council, he knows not to let sour feelings spoil an opportunity to seize more Warpstone.</p>\n<p>It is possible that Lord Gnawdwell wishes to see the Warpstone haul resulting from the Moonbreaker mission spent for the good of all Skavendom, and would order the Clawpack to protect Karak Skygg from outside threats. However, it is more likely that he would requisition as much Warpstone for his own coffers as possible, and he may send in the Clawpack at the last minute to secure Karak Skygg for Clan Mors.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/clan-mors.webp\" width=\"390\" height=\"460\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/banner-mors.webp","folder":"mwbavITOKvFUhTrJ","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Multitudinous Clans","sort":-100000}}}

Among Jarmund’s papers were notes indicating disputes with the Ordo Terribilis over kidnappings and a safehouse in Osttor. He tasks the Characters to investigate the lair, and follow any leads they find. What they do find will lead them to a resurgent Ordo Terribilis led by a dangerous necromancer, @Actor[Sy0829M1A3fxm57R]{Vizier Bhar}, and evidence of its alliance with something far worse — the Skaven.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/mutant-pigeon1.webp\" width=\"241\" height=\"258\" /></div>\n<h3>Chaos Pigeons</h3>\n<p>The safe house location is a boarding house in southern @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.UwIdOmU9LGWhqlbn]{Osttor}. On the top floor, accessible via external stairs, the flat looks south over @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}, The Wynd, and beyond. The lock requires an <strong>Average (+20) Pick Lock </strong>Test, or the landlady, Frau Ziegler, can let them in if she is provided with a plausible reason. If asked about her tenant, she says, ‘<em>Herr Vogel was quiet, a student at the Collegium, always in his books. He was very nice, helping me take care of my pigeons. He’s been gone for days, now, and the rent is due...’ </em>If asked when he disappeared, she answers that he vanished just after the end of the Carnival.</p>\n<p>Searching the flat doesn’t reveal much: an unmade bed, some clothes, a dirty cup on its side. There are texts on mathematics and astrology, as well as a small telescope on a tripod in a corner. An empty nest in a straw-filled box rests atop a shelf by the south-facing window.</p>\n<p>Either while a Character examines the nest, or just as they are leaving, they hear the sound of tapping at the window, where a pigeon waits to get in — a pigeon with iridescent purple feathers on its head, three eyes, and a slip of paper wrapped around its leg. </p>\n<p>The bird is tame and lets a Character hold it to remove the paper, after which it flutters to the nest.

Have assumed command. Operations resume immediately, corpses needed for research. Acknowledge and await instructions. Y’ggrilv tkak Tzeentch! Vizier Bhar, MOT’.</em></p>\n<h3>Flying The Coop</h3>\n<p>Characters with Animal Care or Animal Training know that carrier pigeons are one-way birds, which means ‘Vogel’ probably had a bird for return messages. But there is none in the apartment. There is, however, an obvious dovecote built over the exterior of a window at the end of the common hallway outside the flat’s internal door. Inside are several pigeons — Frau Ziegler’s pets. One has shiny purplish feathers on its head (and only two eyes) , but she insists it isn’t hers. An <strong>Easy (+40) Intuition</strong> Test confirms this is Vogel’s bird.</p>\n<h3>Follow That Pigeon!</h3>\n<p>The Characters may release the second pigeon to see where it goes. Tracking it is simple with the telescope. First it circles and then flies south over @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}, an <strong>Easy (+40) Perception</strong> Test following its flight. However, it descends and vanishes among the spires and peaked roofs of Altquartier. Succeeding at a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test, the observer sees it go down somewhere around where @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{The Wynd} meet, while failure gives them just a general sense of ‘over Altquartier.’</p>\n<h2>Investigation</h2>\n<p>At this point, the Characters know they are dealing with a resurgent Ordo Terribilis and a new Magister. But, how do they find him?</p>\n<h3>Shoe Leather</h3>\n<p>The obvious strategy is to canvas the area looking for clues to the Purple Hand cell. @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{The Wynd}, however, are rough areas under the control of the Low Kings — Edam Gouda and Bleyden split @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}, while @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.pB1MDVRBRyJTptne]{Gouda} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{The Man} dominate @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{The Wynd}. Direct questions might lead to a visit from a Low King’s enforcers — and Characters who earlier rescued @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Gottfried Jarmund} likely have poor relations with The Man, already!</p>\n<h4>The Pigeon Guild</h4>\n<p>If Characters search around the area where the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} meets @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{the Wynd} they notice a great deal of pigeons. The birds flock around the market hoping to find food. If the Characters try to track their movements call for a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test. Those who pass notice a lot of pigeons coming and going from a two-storey building that looks derelict (Crazy Heintze’s). On an Impressive Success (+6 SL) they notice that pigeons also fly to and from a warehouse within a courtyard in which carts are unloaded in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{the Wynd} (@Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.m6sJu0SM67DRIJNt]{Windhund Haulage}).</p>\n<p>Asking around if there is anywhere nearby where pigeons tend to congregate earns the Characters some bemused looks and a common response. <em>‘If you’re looking for pigeons, the best place is Crazy Heintze’s.’</em> Characters can learn from any local that Crazy Heintze has lived on the southern edge of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} for more than 20 years and is <em>‘eccentric, to say the least’.</em></p>\n<p>Crazy Heintze lives in a filthy tenement house which he treats as a massive pigeon coop. His ‘breeding’ consists of letting them nest wherever they want. When the Characters knock here, they hear shuffling and fluttering noises, and a voice saying, ‘Yes, Lady Greyplume, someone at the door!’ A short while later a wiry and unkempt man in his late 50s, opens the door and lets them in. His clothing may have been fine once, but it is now threadbare, faded, and covered in down and guano. Heintze has an odd connection with the birds, understanding them as the result of a magical quirk. He only talks to the Characters by talking to the birds about the Characters. He is convinced they are people and has names for each one, but none have purple feathers. Interviewing Heintze is a strange process as he only responds to the birds, but a conversation might run along the following lines.</p>\n<p>Did one of your birds deliver this message?</p>\n<p><em>‘What’s that, Admiral Avi Anne? The strangers seek to employ you as messengers? How vulgar. And they won’t pay you properly will they? We ought to form a guild! The Pigeon Guild!’</em></p>\n<h4>No, we don’t want to deliver a message, just find out who delivered this one.</h4>\n<p><em>‘Lord Pek the Iridescent, you are quite right! Hahaha! None of us would stoop so low as to run errands!’</em></p>\n<h4>Do any of your birds have purple feathers?</h4>\n<p><em>‘Do they criticise your grey and lustrous sheens, my darlings?’</em></p>\n<h4>Do you know anything about a bird with three eyes?</h4>\n<p><em>‘What say you, young master Coo, barely fledged, you have an unusual lores, but three eyes, none of you would be so deviant as to grow an extra eye. You are proud birds, and upstanding! What’s that, Countess Clawfoot? There are such birds at the place with the carts and boxes, where they work all night.’</em></p>\n<h4>Where is this place?</h4>\n<p><em>‘Master Squab with the missing foot, your intrinsic sense of northwardsness is keen, tell me where it is! South of here, but not far. The Wynd then! A big place with carts coming and going.‘</em></p>\n<h4>You’ve been very helpful, how might we repay you?</h4>\n<p><em>‘They are patronising aren’t they, Baron Roller? If they can’t buy us they can’t own us!’</em></p>\n<h4>Asking The Right People</h4>\n<p>Characters may also seek information about odd doings or even disappearances in the area. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Gossip</strong> Test leads to an old beggar who sweeps up at The Graf ’s Head. For the price of a pint and a meal, Andreas tells how a number of his friends have gone missing recently, ‘<em>just up and vanished without saying goodbye! Oh, ’cept for Mikkal. Saw him a couple nights ago, over in Braun’s Alley, by Wynd. He was just standing there outside the lights, but I recognised his crooked back! I called him, but he just moaned and started moving toward me all weird like. I got scared and hightailed it out of there.’ </em>Any Characters with <strong>Lore (Magick)</strong> or <strong>Lore (Theology) </strong>recognise unmistakable signs of a zombie — Necromancy.</p>\n<p>Investigating Braun’s Alley finds nothing of interest, but on an <strong>Easy (+40) Perception</strong> Test the Character sees pigeons flocking about the eaves of Windhund Haulage close by . The missing persons were kidnapped and killed for Bhar’s research. ‘Mikkal’ staggered out one night through a carelessly left-open gate.</p>\n<h4>@Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NUXlJY1IPwZJzDvO]{Bretonnian House}</h4>\n<p>In return for @Pay[6ss]{6 shillings}, @Actor[D17cqCKU6D4AzdPI]{Alfric Half-Nose} sighs deeply through his sliced nose and asks a question, ‘<em>Windhund does a lot of business, right? How come they haven’t taken on any new customers in months?’</em> If pressed, he shrugs and says, ‘<em>Just an observation.’</em> 2 hours later he passes on news of the Characters’ curiosity to @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.pB1MDVRBRyJTptne]{Edam Gouda}, to whom Windhund pays protection. The Big Cheese in turn informs @Actor[jgxJGa2BF4yyh1p7]{Theodor} at Windhund, as a ‘professional courtesy.’</p>\n<h3>Complications</h3>\n<p>You can use the following events as you wish to crank up the tension.</p>\n<h4>A Message From The Big Cheese</h4>\n<p>Word eventually gets back to The Big Cheese that snoops are digging around Windhund. This in turn leads to a visit from one of Gouda’s street captains, accompanied by some thugs.</p>\n<p>The confrontation takes place on one of Altquartier’s narrow streets or alleys, the thugs positioning themselves at either end. The leader, Hannes, demands to know their business with Windhund and warns them to forget it, ‘<em>Otherwise you’ll make Mr Gouda angry, and you wouldn’t want that.

He comes across as thoughtful, even respectful, as he regretfully explains why it would be best for all involved to just move along so that everyone can end the day with a similar number of teeth as they started with. This should not be mistaken for weakness, however, as when it is called for Hannes has no hesitation in ‘regretfully’ administering a rather serious beating.</p>\n<h4>Nice Doggie</h4>\n<p>Either after their visit to Windhund or after Gouda alerts them, @Actor[Sy0829M1A3fxm57R]{Vizier Bhar} orders the elimination of the Characters. Late one night in either @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{The Wynd}, they are hunted by Bhar’s ‘pet’ @Actor[EfWNlJBIkgsAn6kE]{Lyca}, a zombie wolf infused with daemonic energy. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/daemonic-wolf.webp\" width=\"313\" height=\"293\" /></div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[EfWNlJBIkgsAn6kE]{Daemonic Wolf}</div>\n<h4>In The Belly Of The Undead Beast</h4>\n<p>By now, the Characters likely have identified @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.m6sJu0SM67DRIJNt]{Windhund Haulage} as the lair of the Purple Hand cell. While breaking and entering is a probable course of action, they may also seek to bring in reinforcements.</p>\n<h3>The Big Cheese</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.m6sJu0SM67DRIJNt]{Windhund Haulage} sits in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.pB1MDVRBRyJTptne]{Edam Gouda’s} territory, paying him protection money to remain undisturbed. However, the Big Cheese does not know that the smuggling operation is a cover for a Chaos cult — he would be angry to learn he has been played for a fool. He would also fear Middenheim’s reaction to the news he was harbouring a dangerous cult, particularly after the events of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>.</p>\n<p>By working contacts and dropping coin around @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier}, the Characters can get word to Gouda that they want a meeting. </p>\n<p>It will take evidence of the true nature of Windhund, such as the coded message, the three-eyed pigeon, or the fight with the undead @Actor[EfWNlJBIkgsAn6kE]{Daemon Hound}, and a successful <strong>Very Hard (–30) Charm</strong> Test to persuade the Big Cheese to stand aside. He won’t lend direct help, but his men won’t interfere, if the Characters make a move against Windhund.</p>\n<p>Failure has consequences, however. On 0 to –1 SL, Gouda throws them out, but enough doubt is planted in his mind that he does not warn Windhund. Failure by –2 to –3 SL means Gouda remains unconvinced. He dismisses them with a warning to mind their own business, as well as relieving them of their cash as a fee for his time. On a greater failure, Gouda has the Characters seized, robbed, and beaten before being thrown out. Worse, he warns Windhund and Bhar, who then flees Middenheim with all his documents.</p>\n<h3>The Man</h3>\n<p>Resourceful Characters may think to approach @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{The Man} about the situation with @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.m6sJu0SM67DRIJNt]{Windhund Haulage}, after all, even the Low Kings do not suffer to be associated with the Ruinous Powers. After @Actor[ifU0ivHW4U1B37mo]{Gottfried Jarmund’s} rescue however, the Characters may have ‘strained’ relations with The Man, and the risk should they fall into his hands is great. But, taking that risk could benefit them.</p>\n<p>Through intermediaries such as @Actor[D17cqCKU6D4AzdPI]{Alfric Half-Nose}, the Characters can arrange for a meeting with ‘Emmerich,’ one of The Man’s under-bosses. Meeting at @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.8x81Sf2KDxivJ2uM]{The Journeyman}, the usual staff is nowhere to be seen, while several hulking men occupy the other tables. Other customers are turned away because of an ‘event.’ Before the Characters can say anything, Emmerich opens with a question, <em>‘The Man would like to know why we shouldn’t kill you now and toss your bodies off the Fauschlag.’ </em></p>\n<p>If he is told that Gouda harbours a follower of Chaos then Emmerich, acting for his boss, agrees to allow the Characters, and any help they bring, free passage through The Wynd to raid Windhund. This lets them sneak an armed force close to Windhund without alerting Gouda.</p>\n<p>Emmerich has one condition: their promise on behalf of Marshall @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} that, when @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{The Man} decides to eliminate Gouda and absorb his territory, the Watch will stand aside. They cannot ‘<em>go back to consult</em>’ — he wants their answer now.</p>\n<p>Failure means the meeting comes to an abrupt end. Emmerich’s toughs do not attack, but he advises them to never, ever show their faces in The Man’s territory again.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[f26xUFqmgNP7KLEg]{Windhund Haulage}</h3>","folder":"d3F8uouOY9CK6j5I","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Ordo Terribilis Resurgens","sort":0}}}

{"_id":"V1iOTAFhXWJMrdp3","name":"Part Four: Don't Picket","content":"<p>This incident takes place during chapter 18 of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, as the Characters arrive at @JournalEntry[56cL3qsLbEtoY81L]{the Picket}. Shaken by his defeat at Lindenheim, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} spent the day watching the village from the forest in the hope of learning their secret. He is convinced that the ‘Holy Boot’ that almost struck him dead must certainly be the work of a powerful priest of Morr or similar blessed individual, though he wished to be certain of it before making his move against them. He recognised the Characters when they arrived, and was horrified when they started talking to the villagers and inspecting the damage from his attack. The villagers were talking to them very earnestly, and seemed to be telling them all about it.</p>\n<p>To @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} self-obsessed mind, there was only one explanation: the Characters must be an elite group of witch hunters, probably hired by his archenemy @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.bUxA8zyayMarTXP7]{Father Marcus}, and dedicated to hunting him down. Having failed to kill him on the Reik, at Altdorf, and at @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}, they must have tracked him from Middenheim and followed him into the foothills. Now, clearly, they have come to @JournalEntry[56cL3qsLbEtoY81L]{the Picket} to recruit an army to hunt him through the mountains.</p>\n<p>The Characters, of course, will see things differently. This strange and annoying necromancer has been complicating their lives ever since he attacked their barge on the way to Altdorf, and based on how often their paths cross, some of the party may well conclude — erroneously, but not unreasonably — that he is out to get them for some reason of his own.</p>\n<h3>Skulduggery by Night</h3>\n<p>The first night the Characters are at @JournalEntry[56cL3qsLbEtoY81L]{the Picket}, they will have a lot on their plate. In addition to the frosty reception they receive, they must also investigate the possibility of a smuggler at work, contend with the terrible reputation they have been afflicted with by whoever spread rumours of them before they arrived, and consider the implications of an upcoming Skaven attack on Brass Keep. The last thing they need is one more complication — but, of course, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} provides it.</p>\n<p>Using the same ritual he used in @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} (see <strong>Power Behind the Throne Companion</strong>), he enchants a @Actor[FRS2PzhU3H98XfTX]{skull} provided by a loyal servant and sends it into the depot to spy on the Characters. Unlike the Pritzstock skulls, which were intended to spread fear and alarm, this one needs to avoid attention. To that end, Gräber has blackened it with campfire ash and done his best to magically subdue the flames that surround skulls subject to the spell. However, this cannot hide the reddish glow in the eyes of an active skull. Noticing the skull is an <strong>Easy (+20) Perception</strong> Test if it is facing the onlooker, but <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong> if it is not.</p>\n<p>The full rules for @Actor[FRS2PzhU3H98XfTX]{Flying Death Skulls} may be found in the <strong>Power Behind the Throne Companion</strong>, in the adventure of that name. For the purposes of this incident, you only need the @Actor[FRS2PzhU3H98XfTX]{Flying Death Skull} profile.</p>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} first priority is to have the skull find out where the Characters are, and then track them to try to learn what they are doing. He tries to make sure it is not seen, as it flits from building to building, peering in windows as it goes.</p>\n<p>There are no scripted events here: the GM should feel free to improvise, giving the Characters a glimpse of the skull (or, more likely, the glowing red points of its eyes) here and there as they try to deal with whatever else is going on at the time. A few examples are below.</p>\n<h4>The Face at the Window</h4>\n<p>The Characters are in a building, perhaps at dinner with some of the Picket’s officers, when one of them or perhaps a companion  notices a red light outside the window. The skull is peeking in at the Characters, and withdraws the moment @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} realises it has been spotted.</p>\n<p>By the time anyone makes it out of the building, the skull is gone. It may have gone to ground somewhere in the compound — behind a pile of equipment, for example, or even hiding face-down in the kitchen midden — or @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} might have flown it back over the depot wall and back into the forest. If it is still in the compound, there may be a slim chance of finding it with a determined search; if it has returned to its master in the forest, there is no chance at all.</p>\n<h4>A Strange Bird</h4>\n<p>The Characters are alerted by shouts from over by the mess, followed by the reports of a few pistols. They arrive on the scene to find a small group of pistoliers peering excitedly up at the night sky. Their accounts vary, but all agree that something flew over their heads, about twenty feet up, as they were leaving the mess. Some say it was a night-bird, others a bat, and others still that it was something else entirely. All mention its two glowing red eyes and agree that at least one of their shots hit the thing.</p>\n<p>Searching the ground outside the mess hall — a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test in the darkness, reduced to <strong>Challenging (+0)</strong> by @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.x0WMGwuQzReXcQrs]{Night Vision} — turns up a fragment of unmistakably Human jawbone. Most of the mandible is covered with soot and ash. A Physician or similar Character may be able to venture, on a successful <strong>Average (+20) Lore (Medicine)</strong> Test, that it has been a long time dead and probably buried. It is evident that indeed one of the pistoliers connected, blasting the jawbone from the skull. </p>\n<p>Those with @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} see lingering wisps of <em>Dhar </em>on the thing, an almost sure sign of necromancy. If the user has had previous experience with the Gravelord’s magic, they recognise it as bearing the unmistakable imprint of his work.</p>\n<h4>A Minor Disturbance</h4>\n<p>The Characters are passing close by the stables when they hear the scream of panicking horses. @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} sent his skull into the building to watch the party surreptitiously through the narrow windows, but failed to anticipate the effect that the unnatural thing would have on the high-strung cavalry mounts stabled there.</p>\n<p>The GM can decide how badly the horses panic at the sight of the skull. One or two might kick down the doors of their stalls and run out into the depot, requiring some time and several good Animal Handling Tests to recover them. A groom might be trampled in the process, requiring healing. In the worst case, the groom might have been carrying a lantern and dropped it in the disturbance, setting a pile of straw alight, dooming all the remaining horses unless the fire is brought under control quickly.</p>\n<p>Cavalry commander Jochem Muratz is on the scene quickly, accompanied by three or four of his most senior officers and demanding to know what is going on. Unless he sees the skull himself, or is told of it by one of his own cavalrymen, he dismisses anything the Characters say about it. Instead, he concludes — especially if the Characters are in the stables when he arrives — that they are saboteurs or worse, who tried to injure his horses and are now trying to fob him off with ridiculous excuses. </p>\n<p>If the Characters are unable to convince Muratz of their innocence, they find themselves seized by several cavalrymen apiece and dragged behind the cavalry barracks. There, depending on their relative social status, the Characters face a brutal beating (a ‘sound thrashing’ as Muratz puts it) or a duel.</p>\n<h4>A Need for Discretion</h4>\n<p>There are several times during this chapter of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong> when the Characters will not want to be seen or heard. They may be trying to search the @Actor[8qd6FGyat5lDkwXa]{quartermaster’s} offices, for example, or to spy on the Picket @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Commander} or her officers. Any such occasion provides a perfect opportunity for @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber’s} flying skull to cause problems.</p>\n<p>As it peers into the window of whichever building they are trying to search, the skull might attract attention. Even if its red eyes are facing away from an observer, their unnatural glow will reflect in the glass, and be particularly noticeable after dark. People who come to investigate the strange light may very well stumble upon the Characters. Or, if they have been sensible enough to post a lookout, someone else’s approach forces them to abandon their search temporarily.</p>\n<p>To make things worse, the skull might bump into something as @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} becomes so intent on seeing what the Characters are up to that he neglects the fine control of his magical drone. The results of this could range from annoying but trivial, such as a loud collision or a broken window, to the potentially catastrophic, such as a knocked-over oil lamp.</p>\n<h3>Searching the Forest</h3>\n<p>The Characters may already have realised that their path has crossed the Gravelord’s once more, but the appearance of a @Actor[FRS2PzhU3H98XfTX]{Flying Death Skull} confirms it beyond any doubt. The thing is too small, and moves too quickly in the darkness, for anyone to be able to follow it to its master; and since it flies, it leaves no trail that can be followed. Even so, Characters who are confident in their outdoor skills may decide to scour the woods — as, perhaps, they did around @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock} — in an attempt to find the necromancer or his lair.</p>\n<p>It would take weeks to search the surrounding forest thoroughly, and even if the Characters do stumble upon a small patch of flattened brush where Gräber crouched while controlling his flying skull, and even if they do manage to follow his trail back from there to a makeshift campsite among a particularly dense stand of trees, he is gone by the time they get there, having decided to resume his journey (see below). Meanwhile, the Characters have wasted precious time and matters at the depot could be getting out of hand, making their task there considerably harder.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-skulls.webp\" width=\"244\" height=\"261\" /></div>\n<h3>A Strategic Withdrawal</h3>\n<p>After investigating the Characters for a couple of nights — longer if the Players find the experience entertaining, shorter if the attendant complications seriously threaten their chances of success — @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} recalls his skull and leaves the area.</p>\n<p>He has decided that, if they are raising an army, they are not being especially quick about it. If he is honest with himself, he might admit to being disappointed and a little offended that his presence does not seem to merit a more urgent response. Of course, he cannot imagine any other reason for the Characters to be at the depot; in his mind everything revolves around him.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, he thinks, the Characters are simply hiding in the hold, surrounded by troops, and hoping he will go away. He should raise a horde to destroy the fortress — being sure to leave a few survivors to spread the tale of his victory, of course — but attacking a fortified military position is rather different to ransacking a town like  Lindenheim. Also, he tells himself, he has better things to do than play cat and mouse with a handful of witch hunters he has already defeated once. Whatever actually transpired at Pritzstock, he has mentally recast the events to constitute a brilliant victory on his part and a humiliating defeat for the Characters.</p>\n<p>So, inexplicably to the Characters, the skull simply stops appearing. @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} moves away to the north, working his way around the Picket and heading over the mountains toward the Forest of Shadows. The Characters, freed from his harassment for the moment, are free to follow the rest of the adventure, from Brass Keep to Karak Skygg. As they fight their way through the hazards of the mountains and the ancient Dwarf hold beyond, they may forget the Gravelord altogether — which will make the final part of this adventure even more of a surprise.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-book.webp\" width=\"202\" height=\"245\" /></div>","folder":"xzib7Wt4bGWxCCv6","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Return of the Gravelord","sort":500000}}}
{"_id":"VUzXBxceijEeDp2a","name":"The Stolen Village","content":"<p>@JournalEntry[IhiOakvuLXnwjtF3]{Unterfraus} is a village situated below an iron mine in the foothills of the Middle Mountains. Though not thriving, the mines supply enough ore to keep the village comfortable and the roads maintained.</p>\n<p>Recently, the miners stumbled upon the preparations for a Clan Mange watch post. The Skaven were using a Warp-grinder and a Warpstone-powered excavator. The miners were caught in the blast and injured.</p>\n<p>Chieftain Sneee, who was in charge of the dig, realised that they were in danger of discovery and had to act quickly. He raided Unterfraus and ordered that every prisoner have their eyes removed before being herded into the Under-Empire. The mine workings, which lead to the Skaven tunnels, are to be collapsed by a huge explosion as soon as enough supplies of black powder can reach the site.</p>\n<h4>Gelbert Vogel</h4>\n<p>Vogel was one of the miners who was caught in the blast, losing his right arm and severely injuring the entire right side of his body. His fellow miners carried him to the surface as they fled.</p>\n<p>Vogel had such severe injuries it was decided that he needed expert medical attention. As it happened, Pitor Wagner, a pedlar of mining supplies, was in town and was paid to take Vogel to Middenheim. Unfortunately, Vogel did not survive the journey.</p>\n<h4>Pitor Wagner </h4>\n<p>The Characters can find Wagner lodged at <em>The Regents House</em>, a rough tavern in Ostwald. He is able to tell them that when he arrived in Middenheim he brought Vogel’s body to the Temple of Morr, where the unusual wounds were noticed. Wagner believes that the miners were attacked by some sort of spirit of the dead that used magical powers. The surviving miners were full of stories of green glowing lights, flickering lightning, and terrible eyes in the darkness. Wagner happily embellishes this tale.</p>\n<h4>The Corpse</h4>\n<p>Gelbert Vogel’s corpse is currently lying in a vault at the Great Temple of Ulric. As well as the terrible wound from the Warp-grinder, it has been partially dissected by some of the most enthusiastic surgeons at the Collegium Theologica, and is in sorry state. </p>\n<p>The right arm is completely missing. It has been sheared off from above the shoulder and some of the adjoining rib cage is missing too. The wound however seems to have been cauterised leaving a neat arc of blackened flesh. Much of the surrounding skin is tinged green. Vogel’s corpse also bears injuries from the wear and tear of a lifetime of mining, and the recent dissections.</p>\n<h4>Middenheim to Unterfaus</h4>\n<p>As Ulrich Shutzmann claimed, it takes two days hard riding, or four days at a more comfortable pace, to reach Unterfraus. The Characters could even make a diversion to Gladbeich on their way there, though it is off the main road, and this adds another day to the journey.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[IhiOakvuLXnwjtF3]{Unterfraus}</h3>\n<p>The night before the Characters reach Unterfraus every living person there was rounded up by the Skaven, herded through the mines, and into the Under-Empire.

The proximity of several Night Goblin tribes affords Clan Rictus an almost inexhaustible supply of slaves, making the clan immensely wealthy. So much in fact that its stash of Warptokens rivals the treasure holds of Clan Mors; the two clans are forever scheming for a way to usurp the other’s power. </p>\n<p>Clan Rictus’s warriors are all vicious and grim, but it is for its inordinate numbers of large, jet-black furred Stormvermin that it is rightly feared. These elite warriors are stronger and more violent than any Clanrat, and lesser Skaven go to great lengths to keep out of their way.</p>\n<h3>The Deathvermin</h3>\n<p>The Deathvermin, also known throughout the Under-Empire as the Black Death, are the elite of Clan Rictus’s formidable Stormvermin regiments and perhaps the most proficient regiment of warriors in all Skavendom. They are utterly ruthless and have crushed their enemies in countless battles, much to the annoyance of the clan’s Warlord, Kratch Doomclaw. Indeed, the Deathvermin pose a significant threat to Lord Doomclaw’s own power and despite throwing them into hopeless battles on numerous occasions, they have returned victorious every time. </p>\n<h4>@Actor[ZXDEMbc4zpo2QeBA]{Klik Rustclaw — Deathvermin Commander}</h4>\n<h4>@Actor[q5UzPb2HymYgKsuG]{Deathvermin Stormvermin}</h4>\n<h4>Using the Deathvermin</h4>\n<p>The Deathvermin are a particularly dangerous unit of Skaven, used to facing unbeatable odds and coming out on top.

He is aware, via spies placed in Ikit’s Clawguard, of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Castellan-Warlord Gnawretch Skrray’s} pathetic attempts to win the favour (and backing) of Clan Skryre. Kratch finds this loathsome display of subservience particularly commendable — or would, were it directed towards him. He may offer the services of the Deathvermin to tease the possibility of more substantial support, if only to see Skrray grovel. The Castellan-Warlord would surely use the vaunted Deathvermin to strike against the city above, especially if the Characters have uncovered any substantial Skaven presence in the city.</p>\n<h4>Clan Rictus and Clan Mange</h4>\n<p>Clan Mange are so far beneath Clan Rictus that Kratch views them almost favourably — they are, after all, no threat to him. If Clan Mange were to seek the assistance of Clan Rictus in their attack on Brass Keep, Kratch would be delighted to send the Deathvermin against it, especially as his spies have informed him that the keep is far better defended than Clan Mange believe …</p>\n<h4>Clan Rictus and the Cult of the Yellow Fang</h4>\n<p>Clan Rictus have made little use of the Yellow Fang. A single attempt to establish the cult amongst the Orcs of the Dark Lands ended in disaster, and Clan Rictus have had little use for the concept ever since.</p>\n<h4>Clan Rictus and @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack}</h4>\n<p>Despite lending their support to the idea when it was considered before the @JournalEntry[b3IUWHv3Td9hFvKK]{Council of Thirteen}, Clan Rictus have little to gain with Manrack’s wild scheme to rain Warpstone down upon the Middle Mountains. They are currently among the wealthiest clans in Skavendom: their prized Stormvermin and access to the Warpstone that falls somewhat regularly in the Dark Lands assures a reliable income. Thus, they are as likely as not to sabotage the plan should it appear close to fruition. </p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/banner-rictus.webp","folder":"mwbavITOKvFUhTrJ","sort":-50000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Multitudinous Clans","sort":-50000}}}

{"_id":"XzJenEYTArBENmQA","name":"Clan Eshin","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/banner-eshin.webp\" width=\"215\" height=\"344\" /></div>\n<p>Clan Eshin, feared as assassins, murderers, and haunters of the night, are active within and under the cities of man. Wherever there is squalor, Eshin scouts and assassins stir the rats of the city sewers.</p>\n<p>Clan Eshin disappeared into the East early in Skaven history and had been considered lost for many centuries. When its members returned to Skavenblight, they were changed. During that long period in contact with the mysterious Human cultures of Ind, Cathay, and Nippon, the Skaven had learned much about the arts of stealth and assassination. From then on, Clan Eshin has found a clear role in Skaven society — its assassins have become the force the Council of Thirteen uses to uphold its decisions and maintain its reign of terror among the clans. Of course, the services of Clan Eshin are often hired by many other influential Skaven to spy on their rivals or to ‘remove’ overly ambitious political opponents.</p>\n<p>Clan Eshin also provides light skirmishing troops and infiltrators to any Warlord Clan willing to pay its exorbitant price.</p>\n<h3>Clan Treecherik</h3>\n<p>Clan Treecherik are the thralls of Clan Eshin. They are a murderous, untrustworthy, and perfidious clan — even by the dubious standards of the Skaven. Assassination is rife amongst the clan’s ranks; such is the risk of an assassin’s knife that the warriors of Clan Treecherik always strap their shields across their backs. Furthermore, the clan’s warriors tend to wear clothing the colour of Skaven blood — it doesn’t pay to let your packmates know you’re wounded in Clan Treecherik. Far from being detrimental to the clan’s long-term survival, this unremitting killing culls the weak and ensures that only the most skilled and ruthless endure. If a Skaven can survive in CIan Treecherik, he is a born survivor and has little to fear from the scheming and plotting of other clans.</p>\n<h4>The Skurry Stabbers</h4>\n<p>The Skurry Stabbers are one of Clan Treecherik’s most murderous Clawpacks and have slain more (many more) of their own clanmates than the enemy (in fact, it has been several years since they’ve killed anything not from Clan Treecherik). Their current Clawleader is @Actor[xmvcAtDAZR5jmkLE]{Gristl Twitchslice}, an imposing figure who has remained in command of the Skurry Stabbers for an impressive three days. If he can make it to four, he will have broken the service record set by Sneer Throtskar over twenty years ago.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[xmvcAtDAZR5jmkLE]{Gristl Twitchslice}</h4>\n<h4>@Actor[Ul1qjqwIhlrxf0Ga]{Treecherik Clanrat}</h4>\n<h4>@Actor[SPpnvECnLY9Y9dlG]{Clan Eshin Infiltrator}</h4>\n<h4>Using the Skurry Stabbers</h4>\n<p>The Skurry Stabbers are a violent, undisciplined mob more used to stabbing their kin down a dark side burrow than facing surface dwellers. However, the group are well practised in stealth tactics and striking from the shadows. If the Characters are proving tough to face head on, the Skurry Stabbers might be deployed to whittle away their resolve. They release poisons into food and water, harass the Characters at night to prevent them resting, kill or capture NPCs the Characters have had dealings with, and otherwise seek to make their lives miserable. Only if cornered will the Skurry Stabbers face the Characters head on.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">THE SKURRY STABBERS’ MOTIVATIONS</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Prepare for betrayal<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Betray a comrade before </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">they get the chance to do so first<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Find a way to escape </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">thralldom to Clan Eshin<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Find a way to join Clan Eshin proper<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Find a new leader to replace Twitchslice<br /><br /></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style:normal\">If the above are satisfied, confront the enemies </span></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Clan Treecherik and @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim}</h4>\n<p>Clan Eshin maintains a small force of Gutter Runners in Middenheim for gathering information and the occasional discreet assassination. @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Gnawretch Skrray} suspects this to be the case, but is unsure of who or how many of the burrow’s Skaven might be Clan Eshin agents. He has set one of his underlings to uncover this information, but as this agent is a Clan Eshin spy, success is unlikely. </p>\n<p>Clan Treecherik often provides guards on supply caravans to Under-Middenheim, as their paranoid nature makes them excellent sentries. Under Clan Treecherik’s watchful, twitching gaze, as much as half the despatched cargo survives the trip. Clan Eshin makes use of Clan Treecherik’s watchrats as cover for sending information and spies in and out of Under-Middenheim. The clan rarely gets involved in the politics of Under-Middenheim, as it assumes (correctly) that any party it supported would ultimately betray it.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/clan-treecherik.webp\" width=\"359\" height=\"407\" /></div>\n<h4>Clan Treecherik and Clan Mange</h4>\n<p>Clan Treecherik considers Clan Mange something of a blunt instrument when it comes to solving problems. For the right price it might assist the clan in disposing of a few problematic opponents, but would never set foot inside somewhere as lethal as Brass Keep.</p>\n<h4>Clan Treecherik and the Cult of the Yellow Fang</h4>\n<p>Clan Treecherik considers the Yellow Fang to be an extremely useful instrument, and often makes use of them. It has forged some contacts with the cult in Middenheim, but has yet to put them to any use. A handful of clan members are convinced that a parallel cult of Human-worshipping Skaven exists, and hold occasional purges in the name of routing out this group.</p>\n<h4>Clan Treecherik and @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Maliss Manrack}</h4>\n<p>As a Thrall Clan, Treecherik has no vote on the @JournalEntry[b3IUWHv3Td9hFvKK]{Council of Thirteen}. However, Clan Eshin often uses Treecherik to add a layer of deniability to its involvement in any particular plot. As Lord Sneek voted against the plot to destroy Morrslieb, he is loath to support it openly. Despite this, he is well aware of the potential benefits of raining Warpstone down on the Empire and is determined not to miss out. Clan Treecherik Skaven may well find themselves despatched to Karak Skygg to aid in its defence, with a Clan Eshin assassin poised to foil the attempts of any other clan scheming to kill Manrack before his plan bears fruit.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/banner-eshin.webp","folder":"mwbavITOKvFUhTrJ","sort":-200000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Multitudinous Clans","sort":-200000}}}
{"_id":"Y1J01ULcx9MURsXN","name":"The Mine","content":"<p>A Character making a <strong>Challenging (+0) Track</strong> Test will be able to see that the trail up to the mine has a number of unusual footprints. Some are bare-footed human prints, and others are from the Skaven. Once discovered, following the tracks is easy despite the chaotic movements they reflect. They follow the road and disappear into the mine.</p>\n<p>Sneee’s plan has always been to blow up the mine one hundred yards or so into the mountain, a good distance from the Skaven outpost. He wants it to be a spectacular blast leaving no chance of repair. He  has had some logistical problems obtaining enough black powder, so the explosion has not occurred yet. A shipment of powder has recently arrived from the picket near Brass Keep, and so the detonation is imminent. In addition, he has had his Warp-grinder team get to work on weakening the rocks around the blast area to ensure even more destruction.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have been taking their time and showing little urgency during their journey to Unterfraus and their exploration of the village, then the GM could decide that this explosion occurs as they begin to make their way up towards the mine. This prevents pursuit of the Skaven raiders. Otherwise, the Characters have time to enter the mine and potentially prevent the explosion.</p>\n<p>The mine entrance is easy to spot. There is a railway leading into the darkness, and some equipment is messily strewn about the site. There is a stone-built foundry, whose fires have been left to die, and some wooden sheds that are used as workshops and for storage. Two railway wagons are parked outside, laden with ore for smelting. In one of the sheds is a pile of pig iron.</p>\n<p>The railway follows the main route into the mine for a few hundred yards, but the mine works soon split into several branches. A <strong>Difficult (–20) Track </strong>Test reveals the route taken by the villagers. If the Characters choose the wrong route, then they are spotted by a Clanrat sentry who waits for them to go before sneaking off to notify his superiors. This gives the Characters no time to find the correct route, and the mine is exploded a few minutes later, when they are exploring a different section.</p>\n<p>If they choose the correct route, then the sentry alerts his fellows of the Characters’ approach. This may result in a pursuit with the sentry having a head start of 5. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.03r3y37RFKAFM82c]{Pursuit} should be continued for 5 rounds. If the sentry is caught in that time, the Characters may deal with him and creep up on the demolition crew (though the GM may decide that Brakit performs the demolition if they take too long). If the Pursuit is inconclusive after 5 rounds, the sentry runs into the demolition crew a short distance ahead of the Characters.</p>\n<p>If the sentry breaks away, the Skaven remaining in this section use their advantage to ambush the Characters from the shadows, and then retreat to safety. They, of course, have no desire to be caught in the blast or on the wrong side of it, and so fight with an eye to fleeing before it is too late. </p>\n<p>Brakit is a @Actor[KAB3UZ20z9m8fUQ3]{Warlock-Engineer} armed with a @Item[9umJu52U1cvrYn5z]{Warplock Pistol}. He is accompanied by three @Actor[E7pge5rgT241TLyD]{Skavenslaves}, three @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{Clanrats}, a @Actor[rstpLmH4aSOfEAtb]{Clanrat Pawleader}, and two @Actor[3rFSuyNlf6j93mBy]{Weapon Crew} equipped with a Warp-grinder.</p>\n<p>The Warp-grinder that was used to help excavate the Skaven outpost has also been used to widen the tunnel section to allow the raiding party through, and the captured villagers back. It is also being used to weaken the rock formations around the black powder barrels. Once the operators realise they are being attacked, they turn the Warp-grinder against the Characters with unpredictable results. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/items/bomb.webp\" width=\"216\" height=\"239\" /></div>\n<h4>Ignition</h4>\n<p>Explosives expert Brakit is in charge of the detonation of the black powder. He has already arranged the barrels of powder along the mine area. When the Characters arrive he is close to finishing laying out his slow match. All he needs to do is roll out another 20 yd of match and light it. If the Characters have acted well so far, they should have an opportunity to stop him, but it is not easy.</p>\n<p>Brakit is well aware of the need to keep the Skaven presence secret, and so is reluctant to detonate the explosives while there are still some Skaven on the wrong side of the blast. On the other hand, he has no compunction over killing his own kind. Burying his comrades under tonnes of rock could solve two problems. This, of course, means that the Characters are also at risk of being caught in the explosion.</p>\n<p>Anyone in the middle of the rockfall has no chance of survival, and so Characters should probably only be caught at the edge of the blast. That will be dangerous enough. If confronted by the Characters, Brakit attempts to light the match and then run as fast as he can away from the explosion. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/karzburdger-crest.webp\" width=\"251\" height=\"263\" /></div>\n<h4>The Kärzburdger Crest</h4>\n<p>Brakit has found that Yellow Fang agents working at a military picket at Brass Keep are a good source of gunpowder, and over the past few weeks he has used their help to assemble a small stash of kegs. The Kärzburdger crest is stamped onto these kegs, providing a clear clue to their, albeit unwitting, involvement. If Characters reach the kegs before the explosion is set off, they can retrieve 12 kegs decorated with the crests. If they arrive after the explosion, a shattered piece of keg decorated with the crest can be found in the rubble on an <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test.</p>\n<p>Characters may like to take kegs of gunpowder and use them as weapons later on in the adventure. This is possible, but not very practical. Provided they are kept dry the kegs count as @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.X8WFQf0HB9yXKjdD]{Bombs} but have an Enc of 2. They could be used to attack structures, in which case they inflict twice the damage they otherwise would.</p>\n<h4>Aftermath</h4>\n<p>If the Characters manage to prevent the Skaven from blowing up the mine then they will have decisions to make. They may feel obliged to follow the adventure deeper into the mountain, despite being ordered to report back to Middenheim as soon as they know the cause of Vogel’s wounds (which they should have worked out by now). They already have some useful information, the Kärzburdger black powder, and perhaps some Skaven corpses.</p>\n<p>The residual lurid Warp-glow and fragility of the Warp-grinder created passages are foreboding even to the Skaven. The residue of <em>Dhar </em>that pervades them should be off-putting to any Wizard, and count as a @Corruption[minor]{Minor Corrupting Influence} to all who use them.</p>\n<p>If the Characters do continue, the first area they will come across is likely to be the Skaven outpost. This is well defended, although Sneee and the majority of the raiding party are accompanying the captured villagers and are long gone.</p>\n<p>Beyond the outpost things will get increasingly more dangerous. The size and power of Skaven parties will grow considerably, and so too will the likelihood of running into even more terrible creatures. If Sneee or other warlords perceive the Characters as a threat, then they make sure to pit strong forces against them. Any Characters who decide to enter the Skaven Under-Empire are bound to realise their error sooner or later.</p>\n<p>If the Skaven succeed at blowing up the mine, the party will have no chance of following up this line of investigation, or any hope of ever finding the people of Unterfraus. This section of the mine will be completely unworkable and would take a large gang of professional miners many weeks to fix.</p>\n<p>The Characters will have time to investigate the village after the explosion. Eventually, a company of the Baron of Holzbek’s soldiers will turn up to cordon off the area and go about their own heavy-handed and largely fruitless investigation. A few weeks later flyers on behalf of the Barony of Holzbek will be seen around Middenheim, telling of great new work opportunities to be had in Unterfraus for hard workers with mining experience.</p>\n<p>The Characters are likely to come across enough evidence to give them a decent idea of what has happened to the people of Unterfraus. However, they need some very concrete proof of Rat-people if they are to put forward such an outlandish theory. Even if they are successful in convincing the authorities, the incident is officially put down to a simple mining disaster. </p>\n<h4>Rewards</h4>\n<p>Good roleplaying and clever thinking should be rewarded, but there are additional XP for the following:</p>\n<p>@Exp[20, Eliminated the Skaven in and around the mine]{20–40 points for eliminating the Skaven in and around the mine}</p>\n<p>@Exp[15, Discovered the mine]{15 points for discovering the mine}</p>\n<p>@Exp[15, Discovered the Kärzburdger crest ]{15 points for discovering the Kärzburdger crest}</p>\n<p>@Exp[10, Explored Unterfraus]{10 points for exploring Unterfraus}</p>\n<p>If Skaven bodies are taken from Unterfraus and exhibited in Middenheim increase the Evidence Score by two.</p>\n<p>No doubt, some fanciful thinkers are inclined to think that the incident was caused by the return of the Harlequin Hurdy-gurdyist of Hovelhof, and if the Characters spread the story themselves they undermine their case and reduce the Evidence Score by one.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/rat-ogre-moulder.webp\" width=\"503\" height=\"331\" /></div>","folder":"EsaUSrnoAQeWIrLb","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Unterfraus","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"YBPafHM4RHv3I44m","name":"Part Two: The Restless Dead","content":"<p>This incident takes place when the Characters reach Hohenfahrt on their way to @JournalEntry[56cL3qsLbEtoY81L]{the Picket}, during chapter 17 of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. Like Part 1, it is intended mainly to foreshadow the later encounters, although some Players may take some satisfaction in the thought that they are gaining on the annoying necromancer.</p>\n<h3>Watching the Neighbourhood</h3>\n<p>As they approach the village, the Characters are challenged by a group of locals who have apparently decided to question everyone coming along the Middenheim road. Their leader is dressed in leather armour and carries a spear. He looks like he might be a member of the village militia, but the others are villagers and local farmers armed with an assortment of chair-leg clubs and agricultural implements. One carries a blunderbuss that looks older than he is.</p>\n<p>A few successful <strong>Easy (+40) Charm</strong> or <strong>Gossip</strong> Tests reveals the reason for the villagers’ watchfulness: last night, all the graves in Hohenfahrt’s burying-ground were opened — from the inside, one villager tries to explain, although few of his neighbours believe him — and several generations of ancestors are now missing. They would very much like to know if these ‘furriners’ know anything about it.</p>\n<p>Travelling wizards are greeted with particular suspicion, and this deep into Middenland, priests and other devout followers of Sigmar are greeted with even less cordiality. However, given good manners, reasonable roleplaying, and average or better dice rolls, the Characters should eventually be able to make it past the road block and into Hohenfahrt itself.</p>\n<h3>The Foresters’ Arms</h3>\n<p>At the <em>Foresters’ Arms</em> (or wherever else the Characters decide to stop) everyone is talking about the strange events of the previous night. The Characters can overhear the following rumours while in the village.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘It’s grave robbers, I tell ye. From the city, most like. Them physicians will pay a pretty penny for a corpse, so I’ve heard tell, though I always thought they preferred ’em fresh. I never understood what they want them for, though — once you’re dead, you’re not like to get better, whatever the medicine!’</p>\n<p>‘Grave robbers, my Aunt Fanny. They weren’t dug up — they were raised. You only have to look at the earth to see it was pushed up from below. There’s a necromancer about, you mark my words. They never did catch that Dieter Helsnicht, did they — no, not in any of the stories — and everyone knows a necromancer can live forever.’</p>\n<p>‘Now, that’s just rubbish. Those stories of the Doomlord go back to the Three Emperors. When’s the last time Helsnicht was heard of? Has he been sitting in the forest whittling sticks these hundreds of years? No, he’s dead all right — really dead, I mean. This was someone else. Or something.’</p>\n<p>‘I’ll tell you what it was — Beastmen. All over the forest, they are. They’re careful not to be seen, that’s all, or they make sure no one who sees ’em lives to tell of it. Here’s the truth: it’s been a bad year for weather. We all know the harvest’s close to worthless, don’t we? And it’s not just farmers go hungry in a bad year. Them Beastmen’s been driven out by hunger, and they dug up the graves for the bodies and bones. They eat people, living or dead — everyone knows that. It’s Beastmen, or I’m a Reiklander.’</p>\n<p>‘Keep your Beastmen. I know what’s afoot here. It’s witch hunters — them Sigmarites from Altdorf. No, no, hear me out. Things are getting tense between north and south, and everyone knows there’s a war coming. Well, I know it, Franz, it stands to reason. You’d know it too if you paid attention to the world around you. Anyway, a bunch of witch hunters likely dug up all our dead to make it look like there’s some kind of necromancy afoot, just so they’d have an excuse to come in and burn us all. They Reiklanders are soft, as we’re all well aware, and they’ll stoop to anything so there’s a few less of us on the battlefield when the time comes. Here — you lot aren’t from round here, are you? Any of you from the Reikland? Any of you put Sigmar over Ulric? Any of you witch hunters?’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These and even wilder ideas can be heard throughout the evening, and the Characters could find themselves in quite an uncomfortable position if they give anyone reason to suspect them of being involved. Feel free to improvise further rumours if needed: as the ale continues to flow, the theories and accusations become less and less reliant on common sense, or reality.</p>\n<h3>The Graveyard</h3>\n<p>Investigating the graveyard does not add much to what the Characters already know. The graves are indeed open and empty, a successful <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test reveals distinct signs that they were not dug up from the outside — it seems that the occupants clawed their way out.</p>\n<p>The ground around the graves is full of footprints, some of shod feet, some bare, and some … not. A successful <strong>Lore (Medicine)</strong> or <strong>Lore (Necromancy)</strong> Test identifies the third class of prints as having been made by bony, fleshless feet. The tracks all head off toward the north-east. The careless shambling group is easily followed with an <strong>Easy (+40) Track</strong> Test. They lead into the forest for about fifty yards before turning to the right and running parallel to the road, but out of sight from it.</p>\n<h4>The Gravelord’s Plan</h4>\n<p>Everything here bears out the suspicions that the Players have probably already formed. During the night, Gräber cast the spells @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.FRfAqPlOdwiIitR5]{Raise Dead} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.7BJDTRG65hwt1fUK]{Reanimate} several times by the graveyard, providing himself with an Undead escort and fighting force on the next leg of his journey. He intends to travel across the Middle Mountains into the Forest of Shadows to continue his search for the three legendary necromancers Dieter Helsnicht, Zacharias the Everliving, and Melkhior the Ancient.</p>\n<h3>Leaving Hohenfahrt</h3>\n<div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/ghoul.webp\" width=\"262\" height=\"352\" /></div>\n<p>The Characters now know that they are less than a day behind the necromancer, and rather than spend the night in Hohenfahrt they may decide to press on in the hope of overtaking him. This draws some comments from the locals, expressing doubts as to their good sense, sanity, or respectability. The denizens of Hohenfahrt are notoriously insular, but even they would not wish to put travellers on the road when the restless dead are about. This is doubly true if the strangers look well armed — should the zombies return, the villagers will have time to escape while the creatures are chewing on them. The landlord of the <em>Foresters’ Arms</em>, a gloomy Wastelander named Georg Bentinck, is particularly vocal in this regard, pointing out that he has two very nice rooms available for a very reasonable price. This is particularly helpful, as it will also increase the Characters’ chances of running into @Actor[5UlC6nsMTnzN9ZHB]{Valeria} during @JournalEntry[c0DYAS0qQIR3hiXl]{‘Suspicious Behaviour’}.</p>\n<p>Whenever the Characters leave Hohenfahrt, the necromancer’s trail leads them directly to Lindenheim.

Lately, dreadful cries are reported to shake the very stones of the nearby Middle Mountains at all hours. While this would normally clearly be Baron Holzbek’s responsibility, he is tied up with a series of skirmishes against local Goblin tribes. However, Holzbek sent a request to the Graf asking for support when a Beastmen scout was spotted in the area. An unusual detail in his message noted that the ‘scout’ apparently had the head of a giant rat…</p>\n<h3>Test-Test!</h3>\n<p>@JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack} has been test firing the Moonbreaker cannon. A golden opportunity to fire upon a moving target presented itself when the Skaven spotted a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.8g9rnHLiZ1pJcPPt]{Griffon} soaring over the Middle Mountains, allowing for the gathering of important information by blowing it out of the sky and inspecting the resultant corpse. </p>\n<p>An @Actor[xDjcPaQmT8Pq1iNJ]{apprentice Warlock-Engineer} and his guards are even now preparing to set out in the footsteps of their forward lookout to inspect the Griffon’s corpse in order to gather data.

The first portion of the journey there is pleasant, at least, as the Characters can travel along the Old Forest Road which boasts frequent Road Warden patrols and comfortable coaching inns. The stretch of the road they’ll travel on passes through one of the only portions of the Drakwald that might be described as tame, though only a fool lets down their guard. </p>\n<p>At just over halfway to the village, the Characters have to leave well-trodden paths when they arrive at the Kleiflusch River crossing. A day’s journey along the river’s northern bank will take them near directly to Gladbeich. The Kleiflusch is filled with peat, smells of iron, and no one drinks it gladly. The soil along the banks is a soft, boot-sucking loam, which makes travel wearisome.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-parchment.webp\" width=\"272\" height=\"272\" /></div>\n<h2>THE VILLAGE OF GLADBEICH</h2>\n<p>The first glimpse the Characters get of Gladbeich are wide fields of barley that surround the settlement. A modest village of just over a hundred souls, Gladbeich is notionally protected by a log palisade covered with moss and a haphazard array of spikes. </p>\n<p>The village’s wooden buildings vary in appearance from the sturdy to the precarious. All have low-peaked roofs covered with grassy sod. Four farmhouses and a coaching inn, the <em>Floodstone</em>, are the biggest buildings in Gladbeich. Each of the farmhouses is fortified by solid reinforced-wood fences. The Kleiflusch runs directly through the town and powers a small water wheel connected to an old grain mill. A makeshift wooden bridge lies over the river.</p>\n<p>The only stone construction evident is a small shrine dedicated to Ulric that stands in the middle of Gladbeich on a small hillock. The outer walls of the shrine are covered with weapons in various stages of rust, though if one of the Characters enters the shrine they’ll see that the weapons covering one inner wall are pristine. This is effectively the village armoury. Armour, swords and bows needed to equip six people are missing.</p>\n<p>The main gate is guarded by two nervous looking spear-wielding guards, one of whom asks after the Characters’ business with a slightly tremulous voice. They look visibly relieved if the Characters reveal that they’ve come from Middenheim. They are reluctant to answer questions, merely directing the Characters to the inn, saying ‘ <em>You’ll be wanting Reeve Klein — ask after her at the Floodstone.’</em> They look very askance at any Wizards, but are especially deferential if there happen to be any priests present — even a Sigmarite one.</p>\n<p>As the Characters pass through the gate, a horrible shrieking cry echoes over the village from the East. It seems to be far off, but still resonant and clear — a grating, shrill screech that lingers in the air, echoing off the looming Middle Mountains. The guards shudder and mutter, ‘<em>Ulric deliver us from the Beast’.</em></p>\n<p>The Characters see almost no one about the village, though they’ll be furtively eyed from lookout cupolas atop two of the farmhouses. Gladbeich’s history is a long saga of quiet years, punctuated by occasional raids by Forest Goblins and Beastmen. The most excitement the village can recall (before current events) occurred several decades ago when a Grey Wizard living near the village was exposed as an evil sorcerer and burned. The villagers remain exceedingly wary of Wizards and any party which contains one will suffer a <strong>–10% Penalty</strong> to all Fellowship based Tests.</p>\n<h3>The Floodstone</h3>\n<p>Named for a large granite boulder that came down from the Middle Mountains long ago during a storm and which now sits prominently in the inn’s outer courtyard, the Floodstone is the centre of Gladbeich’s social life. The innkeeper, Arvor Gilbransson is in his 50s with a long grey beard and bright eyes. He runs the inn with the help of his wife, Karin, his two daughters, their husbands, and several grandchildren. He is deeply worried, though he tries to put a brave face on it. One of his sons-in-law is missing, and the irregular haunting cries of the Beast are getting on his nerves.</p>\n<p>Gilbransson meets with any guests, apologising for the present upheaval. If the Characters obscure their reasons for being in Gladbeich, for whatever reasons, but look like competent adventurous sorts, he tries to hire them to have a look into what happened to the missing villagers and what the origin of the horrible cries might be. He offers room and board, along with a small purse. If the Characters represent themselves as the Graf ’s agents, Gilbransson looks visibly relieved and says, <em>‘Ah! You’ll be wanting the Reeve. I’ll have one of the lads fetch her. A moment!’</em></p>\n<h3>Ida Klein – Reeve of Gladbeich</h3>\n<div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/frightened-villagers.webp\" width=\"303\" height=\"309\" /></div>\n<p>Klein leads the small village, answering to Baron Holzbek for the harvest. After long, relatively quiet years since the incident with the Grey Wizard, Ida is beside herself with worry. As the leader of a remote rural village, Ida and her folk are superstitious and feel that the Beast is a curse inflicted upon the village. Much talk has been made of the recent sighting of wolves led by a snowy white pack leader, and of a gigantic stag that lingered long near the river, gazing to the east, and of the rat-headed creature seen prowling the hills near sunset. All these omens were followed by the roaring from the woods, a sound full of anguish, rage and despair. It drew several intrepid villagers into the depths of the forest. The search party that was sent after them was well-armed, but there’s been no sign of any of them returning.</p>\n<p>Tensions within the village are high, and Ida’s leadership is being questioned. At this point, she’s even willing to accept the help of a wizard. Ida has long silver hair, warm brown eyes and very sharp, prominent cheekbones.</p>\n<h3>The Missing &amp; the Anxious</h3>\n<p>Reeve Klein soon arrives, as visibly relieved to meet the Characters as Gilbransson was. She swiftly requests and is granted a private meeting room at the <em>Floodstone</em>, inviting the Characters to join her for a drink and to share what she knows. This is completely necessary, for the second any of the villagers in the bar hear that the Characters are from the Graf, they are bombarded with questions about what they intend to do. The villagers also begin yelling at Klein, demanding action or tearfully begging for help in locating their missing friends and relatives.</p>\n<p>Ida can tell the party the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An incredibly loud sound from off to the east was heard 12 days ago, one that shook the Middle Mountains, and everyone in Gladbeich heard it. A farmer and ex-miner named Friedal swore to Klein that it reminded him of explosives he’d heard Dwarfs use. (This was a clap of thunder that resulted from Warp-lightning.)<br /><br /></li>\n<li>A few days later, one of the villager’s hunters disappeared. Another villager went missing the next day and the terrible, mournful cry from the woods to the east, near the Middle Mountain foothills, was heard for the first time late that night.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>A search party set out the next morning. They sent word that they’d seen what looked to be a Beastmen scout with the head of a large rat along the edge of the foothills. Klein sent word to Baron Holzbek of their plight that very night. The village hasn’t heard or seen anyone from the search party since — it’s been almost a whole week since they disappeared.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The same awful cries have been heard sporadically since, both during the day, and late at night. The villagers think they’ve been cursed and refer to whatever is making the sound as ‘the Beast’.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>A few days after the search party disappeared, a message from the Baron came, saying affairs with the Greenskins were detaining him, but he had sent word to the Graf asking for assistance for Gladbeich.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Reeve has waited in desperate hope since. She has forbidden any villagers from investigating until help came from the Graf, but it is all she can do to keep everyone near the village. She notes that they are ‘people of Ulric all, and not without courage’ — but that they are farmers not fighters. Ida is as worried about a Beastman raid as she is about the Beast, and suspects that the creature might be a monster unleashed by Beastmen.</p>\n<p>The Reeve thinks the best plan is for the Characters to head to the east, determine if they can deal with whatever is out there, or return to inform her what they are facing if they cannot, though she is open to whatever the Characters have to suggest; however, she will not risk more of her people until she knows exactly what they are up against. If the Characters mention Skaven, beyond the context of a single rat-headed Beastman, she looks upset, stating that this is <em>‘no time for levity’.</em>  </p>\n<p>Whatever the Characters decide to do, the villagers of Gladbeich are desperately curious and immediately begin calling out questions the second they and the Reeve emerge from the private room. Klein relates a somewhat grandiose version of whatever she and the Characters agreed.  ‘<em>These brave folk have come from the chambers of the Graf himself to see what is to be done about the Beast’,</em> and so on. The gathered crowd looks hopefully at the Characters until Gilbransson takes a quiet cue from Klein and clears them out of the Floodstone.</p>\n<h3>A Guiding Hand</h3>\n<p>As they leave, a slender teenage girl clad in a green cloak approaches the Characters and declares,<em> ‘ You’ll be needing a guide and that’s me.’</em> The Reeve protests,<em> ‘No Veronika!’ </em>and refuses to countenance it. Play it out with the Characters — the young hunter swears she knows the woods to the east like the back of her hand. The Reeve doesn’t wish to credit this, but if the Characters persist, admits that, despite her age, the girl is a gifted tracker. @Actor[mhPPnuqEN9RpDGxT]{Veronika} is a hunter and her father, who taught her all he knew of such matters, is among the missing. If the Characters side with the Reeve, the girl approaches them later to make another passionate pitch and reveal her missing father. If they still refuse, she slips after them soon after they leave.</p>\n<p>It is early afternoon by the time the Characters have spoken with the young hunter and they’re likely tired from the road. Determine whether they intend to set out immediately, or spend the night at the Floodstone first before getting underway in the morning. If they set out immediately they must make <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Tests to avoid taking a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition. However, they find the beast just before nightfall and before the Skaven Look-See Claw Team. If not, they arrive nearly simultaneously with the Skaven the following day.</p>\n<h3>That Hideous Warbling</h3>\n<p>The missing villagers have been torn to pieces by the injured Griffon. Griffons are normally proud and stoic beasts, screaming either to terrify their prey, or to signal to one another. This Griffon shrieks sporadically because the Warpstone-energy that seared its body is causing it to painfully mutate in twisted spurts.</p>\n<p>Its makeshift lair is a cave wound through the roots of a massive tree, beneath a hillock. It has dragged the corpses of a few of the villagers it has killed to its lair, but others still lie where they were slain — very atypical behaviour for a predatory beast.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/the-beast.webp\" width=\"249\" height=\"331\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[wTnmaQSzzxrGKUUu]{The Beast}</p>\n<p>Anyone tracking @Actor[wTnmaQSzzxrGKUUu]{the Beast} must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Outdoor Survival</strong> Test once they reach the woods 3 miles to the east of Gladbeich. While tracks appear prominently when they are first made here, the loamy ground soon covers them up, making tracking difficult. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Cat and Mouse</em></h3>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:119px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:35.4896%;height:17px\"><strong><em>SLs</em></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:63.6867%;height:17px\"><strong><em>Effects</em></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:35.4896%;height:34px\"><em>4 or more</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63.6867%;height:34px\"><em>The hunters find the Beast within an hour and can </em>Surprise <em>it, sneaking up under the cover of its pained cries.</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:51px\">\n<td style=\"width:35.4896%;height:51px\"><em>0 to 3</em></td>\n<td style=\"width:63.6867%;height:51px\"><em>The hunters find the Beast, but it takes a few hours.

It </em>Surprises <em>its foes on the first round of combat.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Look-See Claw Team</h4>\n<p>Not long tafter he Griffon was shot out of the sky, @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack} granted @Actor[xDjcPaQmT8Pq1iNJ]{Apprentice Warlock Engineer Krat Snagglefang} command of a team of 10 Clan Mange @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{Clanrats} and two @Actor[3rFSuyNlf6j93mBy]{Weapon Crew} armed with a @Item[lP0b4ATxULZBpIvD]{Warplock Jezzail}. He was ordered to find the dead creature in order to study the trauma caused by the shot using esoteric callipers and an odd device that measures Warpstone energy residuals.</p>\n<p>If the Characters visit Gladbeich before going to Unterfraus, they beat the Skaven to the Beast by a day. How much information the Look-See Claw Team can then derive depends on how much fighting the Characters effected the Beast’s cannon wound, whether or not they left the corpse to rot in the forest, or perhaps burned it. It may well be that the Characters killed the Beast, but still left everything the Look-See Claw Team needed (much to their chittering amusement — stupid man-things).</p>\n<p>If the Characters visit Gladbeich after going to Unterfraus, they find the Beast at about the same time the Skaven do. Have fun describing the two groups blinking at each other over the shrieking and apoplectic Griffon.</p>\n<p>@Actor[xDjcPaQmT8Pq1iNJ]{Snagglefang} promises vague and nebulous rewards to his troops, but threatens them with exceedingly clear and inventive punishments, if they fail to bring down the Beast. However, if things start to go poorly, Snagglefang certainly isn’t above retreating to let the Characters do the heavy-lifting, then immediately returning to retrieve the data by tricking the Characters away from the corpse, ordering his troops to engage them in a running battle as he assumes they won’t have any idea that he is interested in the corpse itself.</p>\n<h4>How it Went Down</h4>\n<p>If the Characters fight off the Skaven and kill @Actor[xDjcPaQmT8Pq1iNJ]{Snagglefang}, they’ll find his strange callipers and unusual device on his body, along with several parchments denoting various bizarre diagrams, covered with Skaven writing. The odd device starts making peculiar clicking sounds when brought near the Beast’s corpse, with higher pitched and faster ones, if it is brought near the charred wound, or the seared wing’s end. The blank spots awaiting notations across the papers surely indicate he was attempting to gather data. </p>\n<p>Presuming the Characters dealt with the Beast, the villagers, though grief stricken over their loss, still do their best to hold a small celebration in their honour. If @Actor[mhPPnuqEN9RpDGxT]{Veronika Troger} survives, Reeve Klein makes a very big deal of the young hunter’s bravery, in part, to give her people a little pride back after their losses. If the Characters played any part in directly saving Veronika, Ida quietly gives them a purse worth a Gold Crown apiece as they are preparing to leave Gladbeich along with her sincerest regard. The villagers are highly sceptical of any tails of ‘Skaven’, though they readily accept that the Characters defeated a pack of very rat-like Beastmen. </p>\n<h4>Scurry-Flee!</h4>\n<p>@Actor[xDjcPaQmT8Pq1iNJ]{Snagglefang’s} first priority is to survive, which predicates bringing back some data his master can use. If the Characters prove to be more than his <em>‘clearly bad-feeble disloyal-false underlings’</em> can handle, the Apprentice will take to his heels, losing some of his equipment and papers as he goes (which the Characters can retrieve if they follow his trail some). </p>\n<h4>Rewards</h4>\n<p>Good roleplaying and clever thinking should be rewarded, but there are additional XP for the following: </p>\n<p>@Exp[20, eliminated Krat and the Look-See Claw Team]{20-40 points for eliminating Krat and the Look-See Claw Team}</p>\n<p>@Exp[30, Slayed the Griffon]{30 points for slaying the Griffon}</p>\n<p>@Exp[15, Discovered the Griffon]{15 points for discovering the Griffon}</p>\n<p>@Exp[10, Dealt with the Villagers in Gladbeich]{10 points for dealing with the Villagers in Gladbeich}</p>\n<p>If Skaven bodies are taken from Gladbeich and exhibited in Middenheim, increase the Evidence Score by two.</p>\n<p>If Snagglefang escapes having observed the Griffon, his notes are of great help to Maliss Manrack who can devote more resources to the advancement of his plans, reduce the Evidence Score by two.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/frightened-villagers.webp","folder":"pZAhZdKgB7zuT7Aa","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Griffon Down","sort":100000}}}

Their troubled history and limited mineral deposits have left them sparsely settled, haunted by monsters and other dangers.</p>\n<h2>HISTORY</h2>\n<p>The Middle Mountains have a long and storied history, one that stretches back far earlier than that of the Empire which now claims it. Before ever Sigmar walked the Old World, the Dwarfs made homes there admitst the tall, unforgiving peaks.</p>\n<h3>Karaz Ghumzul</h3>\n<p>The earliest accounts of the Middle Mountains come from the Dwarfs who settled there during the expansion of the Golden Age. They called this realm Karaz Ghumzul, and the Dwarfs of the Middle Mountains declared their independence from the Dwarf heartland of Karaz Ankor during the War of the Beard (–2000 to –1600 IC). The reasons for this are disputed: some scholars (mainly Elven and Human) claim that the Dwarfs of Karaz Ghumzul were uncomfortably aware of their isolated position and their proximity to the Elven community of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-journals.NkZpd5a3259UqpXD]{Laurelorn Forest}. The Dwarfs themselves maintain that they had larger concerns than a quarrel between two distant kings, for their prospectors had discovered a Chaos gate beneath the mountains, and the realm needed all its strength to contain it.</p>\n<p>In addition to these dangers, the mountains did not yield the expected mineral wealth. When the Time of Woes (-1500 to -108 IC) began and the Greenskins and Skaven fell on Karaz Ghumzul, the Dwarfs abandoned their holds and fled the Middle Mountains to return to Karaz Ankor. They sealed the doors, buried them under rock, and destroyed the roads that led to them.</p>\n<p>To this day, the Dwarfs will not say what drove their people from Karaz Ghumzul, but as they left the mountains near where Castle Lenkster now stands, the Dwarf priests pronounced a curse on the mountains and everything within them. Since then, many prospectors and adventurers have searched for the lost Dwarf mines, but none have succeeded. When Karaz Ghumzul was abandoned, the Brothers of Grimnir were the only Dwarfs who remained behind. These Dwarfen Slayer-Monks became  the guardians of the Keep of the First Slayer, honouring his ancient vow to guard the Chaos gate beneath it.</p>\n<h3>Human Settlement</h3>\n<p>Centuries later, the expanding Humans had no more success in settling the mountains, treating them instead as a barrier that divided the lands of various early tribes. Ironically, this dangerous and monster-haunted terrain provided those early Human communities with a measure of protection from each other, for raiding parties could not cross the mountains in safety. This meant that some of the Human settlements nearby could flourish and grow — the most notable being Middenheim, Wolfenburg, and Bergsburg. While it was true that monsters came down from the mountains from time to time, the hardy folk of the region were well able to deal with them. As the centuries passed and the Empire was born, strategically placed fortresses at Roezfels, Castle Lenkster, and Brass Keep protected the settled lowlands, ushering in an age of peace and prosperity for the surrounding provinces.</p>\n<p>The Incursion of Chaos</p>\n<p>That peace came to an abrupt end in 2302 IC, when the forces of Chaos overran Kislev and poured into the northern provinces of the Empire. The Chaos threat was finally defeated more than 60 years later, but isolated pockets of Beastmen and Chaos Warriors still survive in the Empire’s remotest parts — despite all efforts to root them out. Brass Keep is one such place. It fell to Chaos in the early days of the incursion and has never been recaptured. The forces of Middenheim, Middenland, and Ostland combined to build a great circular fortification known as @JournalEntry[56cL3qsLbEtoY81L]{‘the Picket’} (see @JournalEntry[12lvOI4wQSBD4Lvx]{Brass Keep}), which serves to keep the defenders of Brass Keep contained, and acts as a base from which private expeditions can set out to try to reconquer the fortress.</p>\n<h3>The Gold Rush of 2497</h3>\n<p>Despite the Middle Mountains’ reputation for barrenness, and the fact that even the Dwarfs had failed to find any mineral wealth there in more than a thousand years of searching, there was a brief gold rush in the Middle Mountains in 2497.</p>\n<p>Thousands of hopeful souls set out into the mountains, most of them woefully under-equipped and all of them completely lacking in outdoor survival or prospecting skills. Hundreds died from accidents, bad weather, and monster attacks: those who returned came home poorer than when they had left.</p>\n<p>The birth of the gold hysteria was later traced to the Middenheim pamphleteer Oda Fortune, recently returned from a stint at the mining colony, who had been selling spurious maps at a crown apiece. Authorities found his house burning with an angry mob outside, but no trace of the miscreant was ever found. It was said that he departed for Marienburg the day after the last bogus pamphlet was sold.</p>\n<h2>TERRAIN</h2>\n<p>The Middle Mountains’ forbidding grey peaks rise abruptly from the surrounding forests, forming a barrier that can only be crossed by a handful of passes. It is a harsh and unforgiving environment, haunted by monsters of all kinds — including, some say, a small but stubborn community of Greenskins whose ancestors were not entirely wiped out by the Dwarfs of Karaz Ghumzul.</p>\n<p>While the natural terrain of the Middle Mountains is harsh enough, there are spots here and there — especially the area around Brass Keep — that have been further warped by the long presence of Chaos in the region.</p>\n<p>These lands are not as bizarrely twisted as those of the North, but they can still be deadly. Some folks believe the terrain knows the minute a newcomer sets foot on the land. Unwanted visitors will be received with freak and fierce weather conditions: for example, heavy hailstorms pursue travellers, pounding them with chunks of ice the size of a Human head. Mountain streams leap from their beds like great constricting serpents, striving to drag passers-by in to their deaths. Rocky paths are littered with stones as sharp as caltrops, whose wounds fester and sometimes warp into foul mutations.</p>\n<p>For the most part, though, the Middle Mountains’ terrain is harsh but natural. Ice and snow cap the peaks, razor-edged ridges divide one precipitous valley from another, and mountain tracks wash away in bad weather, becoming treacherous slides of loose rock and mud that can hurl incautious travellers to their doom on jagged rocks far below.</p>\n<h2>LOCATIONS</h2>\n<p>Barren though they are, the Middle Mountains are not entirely devoid of settlement. A few exceptionally hardy farmers scratch a living from the foothills, and there are a handful of other places of note.</p>\n<h3>Brass Keep</h3>\n<p>Originally one of three Imperial fortresses protecting the surrounds of the Middle Mountains, Brass Keep was overrun by the forces of Chaos two centuries ago and has never been recaptured. Chapter 5 of The Horned Rat includes more information on this seat of corruption.</p>\n<h3>The Picket</h3>\n<p>Built on the orders of Magnus the Pious to keep Brass Keep and its denizens contained, this great fortification consists of a ring-wall surrounding the keep and its hinterland, strengthened with wall-forts and supplied by two great depots in Middenland and Ostland. @JournalEntry[56cL3qsLbEtoY81L]{The Picket} takes place in the Middenland depot.</p>\n<h3>The Middenheim Mining Colony and Penitentiary</h3>\n<p>The Middenheim mining colony and penitentiary called Hope Square lies four days’ journey from Middenheim, in an area so remote and dangerous that most prisoners regard the brutal and dangerous existence of convict miners as safer and more comfortable than escaping into the mountains. You can read more about the mining colony on @JournalEntry[twaLkbAXOsDjbW6t]{The Middenheim Mining Colony and Penitentiary}.</p>\n<h3>Castle Lenkster</h3>\n<p>Another of the three great fortresses of the Middle Mountains, Castle Lenkster lies in the foothills to the south of Wolfenburg. It continues its ancient role defending Ostland from threats coming out of the mountains. It is an important staging-post for expeditions into the eastern arm of the mountains, and for troops and supplies bound for the Ostland depot at the Picket.</p>\n<h3>Roezfels</h3>\n<p>The third of the three ancient fortresses, Roezfels is said to have been founded on the site of an ancient Jutones stronghold dating back to before the time of Sigmar. Sometimes called ‘the fort that looks both ways’, it guards the entrance to the strategic Death’s Door Pass and the road to Bergsburg, as well as guarding against threats from the largely uninhabited western part of the Forest of Shadows.</p>\n<h3>The Keep of the First Slayer</h3>\n<p>The Keep of the First Slayer lies beneath the Nordberg, the tallest peak in the Middle Mountains. Part fortress and part temple, it is home to the Brothers of Grimnir, an elite order of Dwarfen Slayer-Monks. When the Dwarfs of Karaz Ghumzul abandoned the mountains, the Slayers remained behind, fulfilling their founder’s oath to guard the Chaos gate that opened beneath the mountain at the time of the Great Catastrophe almost eight thousand years ago, when Chaos first entered the world.</p>\n<p>The Brothers of Grimnir take little interest in the outside world, and are not known for their hospitality to outsiders. The only regular visitors are Slayers who make a pilgrimage to the keep in the hope of being found worthy to join the Brotherhood and finding the redemption they seek at the hands of some abomination of Chaos.</p>\n<h3>Other Remnants of Karaz Ghumzul</h3>\n<p>Sealed beneath heavy rock falls, their great gates rune-locked, and the roads leading to them destroyed, the lost holds of Karaz Ghumzul have long fascinated Human and Dwarfen scholars alike. Although the Dwarfen chronicles of the time are very clear that everything of value was packed up and taken away when the holds were abandoned, they still exert a powerful fascination for historians and treasure-hunters.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/slayer-wizard-wyvern.webp\" width=\"343\" height=\"453\" /></div>\n<p>No doubt, part of this allure is the fact that all the maps and records of Karaz Ghumzul — even their Books of Grudges — were deliberately destroyed as part of the curse the Dwarf priests placed upon their former realm when the holds were abandoned. Of all those who returned to Karaz Ankor in the Time of Woe, not one would speak the name of their hold, or speak of its history or inhabitants, or tell why the realm was abandoned. For a race of such meticulous record-keepers as the Dwarfs, this deliberate attempt to erase the history of an entire realm was completely unprecedented, and still runs counter to every Dwarfen value and social norm.</p>\n<p>No Dwarf living today will admit to knowing anything about Karaz Ghumzul, beyond the fact that it existed once, but was abandoned. Those Dwarfen scholars who study the lost holds do so secretly, under cover of some other research that just happens to take them into the Middle Mountains.</p>\n<p>After the events of The Horned Rat, this conspiracy of silence can no longer be sustained. The lost hold of @JournalEntry[92p1UuxbKSkJsKps]{Karak Skygg} has been found, and seen not only by any Dwarfs who helped defeat the Skaven plot, but also by a large number of manlings. Whatever shame or trauma has been motivating the Dwarfs to try to forget that the whole realm existed, the pretence is over, and they must confront some uncomfortable truths.</p>","folder":"JTeIyCtQuF0ycF4v","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"A Guide to the Middle Mountains","sort":100000}}}
{"_id":"Zk1cJmV9NRTkK6NC","name":"The Cover Up","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/the-dissection.webp\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Eunice Hasche}, professor of Bestiaria at the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica} is researching Skaven existence. She has come into possession of bodies from @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit’s} raid on the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.JAi2HLfYRkYwLC63]{Templar’s Arms} (see @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.YxDrghP4COZgvqSV]{Chaos Strikes By Night}). She plans to field a public dissection of the bodies in order to reveal the ‘newly discovered’ species of ratman. Unbeknownst to anyone, her assistants, @Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Karl Zeigenalter} and @Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Gaius Stummzunge}, are secret members of the Yellow Fang. They plan to swap the Skaven bodies for Ungor corpses with their heads replaced with giant rat heads — just before the dissection . Professor Hasche will be discredited, and the secret of the Skavens’ existence will remain. </p>\n<h4>A Publicke Demonstration</h4>\n<p>The following notices are being displayed around the city:</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/handouts/handout9.webp\" width=\"424\" height=\"250\" /></div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[4xf9xhWHdBgWQtho]{Handout 9}</div>\n<p>The flyer gives the date (whenever the GM prefers the demonstration to be held). </p>\n<h4>The Demonstration</h4>\n<p>An excited crowd gathers at the Theatre of Anatomy. There are scholars, of course, some enthusiastic; others dismissive of @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Professor Hasche’s} ‘ravings of a diseased mind’. But the event has attracted folk from all walks of life. There is also a sizeable mob of protesters, condemning Hasche’’s outlandish beliefs. The Watch prevents them from entering the theatre. </p>\n<p>Eventually, the theatre doors open and the crowd filters inside. </p>\n<p>Seating is arranged in a semi-circle, in high tiers, facing the podium where dissections take place.  @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Professor Hasche} stands by a table of sharp medical implements. Her assistants, @Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Karl} and @Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Gaius}, wheel in two dissection tables, each laid out with a corpse hidden by a white blanket. </p>\n<p>Hasche claps her hands for silence, and begins.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Ladies and gentlemen. Today is a momentous day, when a new addition to the Bestiary will be revealed to science. You are  honoured to be among the first to set eyes upon these marvels of nature. I will reveal two specimens, recently acquired, and examine them using the most sophisticated scientific techniques. Those of a nervous disposition should excuse themselves now. For the rest of you, prepare to be witnesses to a milestone in scientific discovery.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, one of the protestors ( Hasche’s arch-enemy, Dr Lindwurm – see @JournalEntry[oU0MtvOgNpDAMJgB]{Purrsecution}) stands and berates the professor. <em>‘You charlatan, fraud! You think you can hoodwink us into believing your mad theories about “man rats”. You seek to profit from spreading fear and lies — shame on you! Shame! Mark my words — those bodies are fakes!’</em></p>\n<p>Lindwurm is  standing next to the Characters. They might play a part in shutting him up and throwing him out of the theatre. When the drama is over, Hasche claps her hands and smiles. <em>‘There are always a few blind to science who seek to blinker us with their ignorance. Now, let us begin!’ </em></p>\n<p>What her assistants hope to happen next is that the corpses are publicly revealed to be crude facsimiles, Hasche is humiliated in front of the crowd, and ultimately the city, leading to the collapse of her career. </p>\n<p>However, the Characters have a chance to scupper their plans.</p>\n<p>As Hasche begins to unveil one of the corpses, any Character passing a <strong>Hard (–10) Perception </strong>Test notices that the ratman’s head is crudely stitched onto the neck, and is too small for the body. They have an instant to save Hasche’s credibility — leaping up and causing a commotion which makes her stop revealing the rest of the corpse. However, the angry audience forcibly eject the Characters from the auditorium unless the Characters flash the seal @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} gave them and shout out a reasonable excuse to stop the demonstration.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]</span>{H<span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">asche} is furious if her demonstration is stopped. She demands to talk to the Characters to berate them for the disruption. Her assistants glare at the Characters, fuming that their plan has gone awry. Once the auditorium is empty, it is safe to reveal that the ‘Skaven’ are fakes. Hasche forgives them as soon as she realises that they have saved her reputation, and seeks their help in figuring out what has happened to the real bodies. </span></p>\n<p>If the Characters do not act, they have a second chance to save her reputation. After poking the head for a bit, with a puzzled look on her face, Hasche pulls the sheet down the hairy torso and prepares to cut. A Character passing a <strong>Hard (–10) Perception </strong>Test can see that the build is wrong for a Skaven and that the bodies don’t quite match the heads, giving them another opportunity to stop the demonstration. </p>\n<p>If the dissection continues, Hasche cuts into the body. Sawdust scatters from the wound she creates. She steps back, mouth agape. A gasp emits from the spectators, followed by stunned silence. The professor turns slowly to face the audience, her face ashen. </p>\n<p>Instead of two undiscovered specimens, on the tables lie the hairy, hooved and clawed bodies of small beastmen, their heads replaced with those of giant rats, crudely stitched into place. The crowd erupts. <em>‘Shame! Lies! Forgery!’ </em></p>\n<p>Bedlam ensues — protestors surge past security  and begin trashing the theatre, tearing up seats and hurling them around. At the same time, many members of the audience attempt to leave, causing a crush at the exits. The Watch stream in to restore order, weapons drawn. </p>\n<p>Respected scholars of Bestiaria in the audience, infuriated by the apparent deceit of their peer, attempt to reach Hasche to vent their anger. The Characters should have the chance to waylay these individuals before they can cause her harm. Indeed, the Characters should be encouraged to help @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Hasche} escape as her life is evidently in danger. </p>\n<p>Eventually, the Watch takes control and clears the theatre. If the Characters help keep @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Hasche} from danger, she will try to retain their company until she is confident that she is safe from harm. During this time, the party  can try to figure out exactly what is going on. </p>\n<h4>The Scheme</h4>\n<p>When  @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Professor Hasche} announced that she had acquired Skaven specimens, their first instincts were to dispose of the bodies before she could display them to the public. However, this proved impossible, as she vigilantly kept watch over the bodies in her laboratory (stored in barrels and pickled in rum). When she shared her plan to hold a public dissection, her assistants hatched a desperate plan. </p>\n<p>They knew that the barrels would be kept backstage behind the anatomy theatre. They also knew that there was a trapdoor backstage — a refuse chute down which the remains of autopsies were dropped into the sewers below.</p>\n<p>A week before the demonstration, @Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Karl} and @Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Gaius} stole two stuffed Ungor corpses from a display in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica’s} museum. They purchased two giant rats’ heads from Piet Schädling, a local rat catcher, in exchange for a significant purse of silver and his silence. They removed the Ungor heads, and sewed on the giant rat heads. </p>\n<p>They got two similar barrels. They stuffed the Ungor bodies into the barrels and quietly positioned them backstage, the night before the autopsy was to take place. </p>\n<p>The switch took place smoothly. On the day of the demonstration, they followed  @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Professor Hasche’s} instructions and moved the barrels in her laboratory to the anatomy theatre, under her eagle eye, and prepared the dissection tables, laying out the Skaven corpses and shrouding them with white cloth. While Hasche was welcoming the audience, they simply swapped the Skaven for the Ungor and disposed of the Skaven bodies down the refuse chute. Job done!  </p>\n<h4>Heads Will Roll </h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]</span>{Professor Hasche} is utterly bewildered by what has happened. She checked on the bodies moments before stepping out into the auditorium. She swears by Verena that the bodies placed on the table by her assistants were Skaven corpses. She considers her assistants utterly faithful and takes a dim view of anyone accusing them without proof (she will be devastated if she learns of their betrayal). </p>\n<p>Her only explanation must be magic — she is convinced that a rival in the college has hired a wizard to magically replace the Skaven bodies with the cheap fakes, perhaps in order to humiliate her. Her assistants will do all they can to back up her theory. </p>\n<p>If the Characters can regain her honour by proving that she has been the victim of a ruse, @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Hasche} is indebted to them, and they will gain a powerful ally. </p>\n<p>The Characters have a number of clues to find and leads to follow to discover what happened, as follows. </p>\n<h4>The Theatre of Anatomy</h4>\n<p>Exploring backstage of the theatre of anatomy will yield a few clues. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can find the trapdoor that opens to the underground river. Those who work at the theatre can inform the Characters that this is used to dispose of corpses following anatomy demonstrations. The underground river itself is deep and swift, and impossible to navigate. Any evidence thrown down there will have been swept away. <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Apart from the two dissection tables, and drawers and shelves of various dissecting equipment, there are four barrels backstage. Two smell strongly of rum. The other two have traces of sawdust at the bottom. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Hasche} can confirm that the ratmen bodies were stored in those barrels of rum. She kept them in her laboratory, never leaving them out of her sight. The ratmen were still in there on the morning of the demonstration. She knows — she checked. Indeed, she supervised her assistants when they hauled the corpses from the barrels and laid them onto the dissection tables and covered them in cloth, just before the demonstration was to begin. The only time the ratmen were out of her sight was when she gave her introductory speech to the audience in the theatre. The assistants were guarding backstage at that time, and a short while later rolled the tables out to the audience. </p>\n<p>Employees of the theatre do not know where the other two barrels came from. No one ordered their delivery. If the Characters are diligent with their investigations, and offer drinks at the nearby student bar, they can find a young student, Vinzent Veltins. </p>\n<p>Veltins was working in the college library late a few nights before the demonstration, and while outside smoking his pipe, he saw two men manhandle a couple of barrels into the theatre’s back entrance. He thought nothing of it — simply a late night delivery. One man was short, the other tall and broad — but it was too dark to make out much more than that. He certainly doesn’t recognise the assistants, if asked, though their height and build were similar to the two he saw that night. </p>\n<h4>The Ungor Torsos</h4>\n<p>Examining the Ungor torsos reveals some interesting anomalies. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The corpses are actually examples of expert taxidermy — stuffed with straw and sawdust. They are quite old, the fur moth-eaten in places. If this is pointed out to Hasche, she comments that they are reminiscent of the exhibits displayed at the University Museum. <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Investigations at the museum reveal that indeed the Ungor did come from there. Clarita Neuzeller, the museum’s curator, an elderly but sharp-minded scholar, can tell them more. Alerted by the party, she discovers that two Ungor specimens, from the Bestiaria displays, have gone missing, a fact unnoticed until now. There is no indication how they were stolen, but a cleaner remembers they were there at least a week before the demonstration, as she remembers brushing them. The Ungor were originally fully formed — if the Characters can track down the missing heads, Neuzeller will be most grateful. Asked about Hasche’s assistants, Neuzeller recognises them, as they are regular visitors to museum archives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The Giant Rat Heads </h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The giant rat heads have been sewn onto the Ungor bodies using a strong, black thread. Characters of a medical background might recognise it as the type often used to suture wounds.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>The heads are quite fresh, but not rotting. They have been treated with formaldehyde to preserve them (the assistants did this after they acquired them — plenty of preserving chemicals in Hasche’s lab ). They are not stuffed like the Ungor corpses. Both have a mortal wound to the skull, probably a crossbow shot. Examining  the wound of one of the heads reveals the head of a crossbow bolt. If this is closely examined, a fletcher’s mark will be found. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elmo Flensburger, the fletcher who made this bolt can easily be identified, if this mark is shown to fellow fletchers. He is  a well-known weaponsmith in Middenheim. A fat, balding man with a fierce black beard, he’ll answer any questions if his palm is crossed with silver. He acknowledges that he manufactured the bolt, but he keeps no record of customer orders, and he makes dozens of them throughout the year. </p>\n<p>However, if the Characters mention that they found it in the head of a giant rat, Flensburger wonders whether it was a rat catcher client of his  — Piet Schädling — whom he regularly supplies with crossbow ammunition. </p>\n<p>Piet Schädling haunts a dingy @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} venue, @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.E5bSOrmCYUv3TCzn]{The Baiting Pit}, gambling and drinking. A bull is being worried by vicious Hobhounds to the cheers of the bloodthirsty onlookers. Money changes hands as the spectators bet on which dog will survive the bout, or which will bring down the bull. Piet is down on his luck and out of pocket, but if the Characters loan him some silver and ply him with drink, he’ll loosen his lips. He tells them that about a week ago, he was commissioned to hunt down a couple of giant rats and provide his customers with rat  heads. He promptly went down into the sewers and delivered — there are plenty of giant rats lurking down there. </p>\n<p>@Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Zeigenalter} and @Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Stummzunge} were his customers (of course they deny all involvement). However, Piet refuses to describe them, as he was paid to keep schtum. A  significant bribe will help— Piet has had a run of bad luck in this gambling den. </p>\n<p>@Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Zeigenalter} is worried that he has left a loose end in his scheme. He has informed the Yellow Fang of the Piet’s identity — they have sent a hired thug to dispatch him. The thug is among the crowd at the bullpit, intent on doing away with Piet with a swift dagger between the ribs. Perceptive Characters might notice the undue attention he’s giving Piet, and intervene before the thug’s dagger strikes. Any scuffle sparks a mass brawl among the drunken and riotous crowd, and as well as deal with the would-be assassin, the Characters must ensure the rat catcher’s safety in the tumult. After 5 rounds the Watch intervene and drag people away to the cells, Piet being one of them. The Characters have to try to negotiate his freedom before Piet will talk to them.  </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/eunice-hasche.webp\" width=\"256\" height=\"301\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Eunice Hasche}</p>\n<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-around\">\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column\">\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/gaius-stummzunge.webp\" width=\"260\" height=\"351\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Gaius Stummzunge}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column\">\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/karl-zeigenalter.webp\" width=\"338\" height=\"347\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Karl Zeigenalter}</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>The Assistants</h4>\n<p>If interviewed, @Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Karl Zeigenalter} does all the talking. @Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Gaius Stummzunge} simply nods or shakes his head impassively. Karl does all he can to ingratiate himself with the party and play innocent. </p>\n<p>The assistants claim that they have no idea how the Ungor bodies appeared. They say that just before they wheeled the dissection tables out to the auditorium, there was a flash that temporarily blinded them and a smell of sulphur. They quickly recovered but had no time to locate the cause, as they needed to wheel the tables out to the auditorium. </p>\n<p>Both are seasoned liars. It will be difficult for the Characters to detect that they are telling lies . </p>\n<p>The assistants are confident that nobody will discover their plot, and remain at the Professor’s side — should they make a run for it, suspicion will undoubtedly fall on them, so they stay put. </p>\n<h4>The Assistants’ Lodgings</h4>\n<p>@Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Karl} and @Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Gaius} share lodgings in the college’s halls of residence. Unless they can persuade the college authorities (especially Hasche) that her assistants were responsible for the disappearance of the Skaven corpses (for example, by tracking down Piet the rat catcher, or providing evidence that the Ungor bodies were stolen by the assistants from the museum), access to their lodgings will be forbidden. </p>\n<p>Determined Characters can try to break into the lodgings, dodging the college security — retired watchmen or the like employed as porters. Though elderly, they can still put up a bit of a fight, and if they sound the alert the Watch prove a more difficult adversary. </p>\n<p>Keys to the lodgings are held by the porters at the halls of residence reception, and can be pilfered by sneaky Characters (or they can hire a thief to do the deed), or they  can trick their way in some way. The lodgings are on the third floor, so only an accomplished cat-burglar can access the rooms through the outside windows. A Halfling Character might brave access via the chimney. </p>\n<p>At night, the lodgings are occupied by the assistants, but by day @Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Karl} and @Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Gaius} are at work, helping the professor, and the lodgings are unoccupied. </p>\n<p>Karl likes to keep his residence immaculate, and everything is kept in order. In contrast, Gaius’s room is a complete mess. There are several important clues here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It was on the kitchen table that the work assembling the fake Skaven was done, a Character passing a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception </strong>Test spots sawdust under the table, which matches the colour and texture of the sawdust used to stuff the Ungor bodies. <br /><br /></li>\n<li>A box under @Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Zeigenalter’s} bed contains a sewing kit, including a roll of suture thread identical to that used to sew the Giant Rat heads. <br /><br /></li>\n<li>A mounted Ungor head on the top of a coat stand can be seen in the corner of @Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Gaius’s} room, from where it glares down with beady glass eyes. The head is stuffed with the same type of sawdust found on the kitchen floor and used to stuff the Ungor bodies.  It is a perfect match for one of the stuffed beastman corpses – this is surely enough to prove that the assistants were involved with the sabotage of Hasche’s demonstration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Revealing the Culprits</h3>\n<p>If the Characters amass enough evidence to reveal that the assistants were the culprits, they need to use the information carefully.</p>\n<p>If they confront the professor alone, she is shocked at the revelation and upset that her assistants have betrayed her. However, they have not committed a crime as such — they have simply dented her scholarly reputation. All she can do is dismiss them. Their only criminal behaviour is stealing and damaging the old Ungor exhibits from the museum, which is due cause for dismissal. </p>\n<p>If the assistants are confronted with evidence of their scam, they deny what can be denied, but if pressed will claim that they were paid by Dr Arnau Dinkelacker, one of Hasche’s rivals,  to disrupt her demonstration. Knowing that their game is up, they will try to disappear, pack their bags and leave their lodgings for an undisclosed location. </p>\n<p>Dr Dinkelacker is indeed a bitter rival of <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Professor Hasche}, decrying her field of expertise, cryptozoology, as a mere pseudoscience. Whilst he is glad that her ‘foolish’ demonstration came to nought, he has no idea who her assistants are and certainly did not pay them to disrupt her work — he is an honourable man and would not stoop so low to discredit a fellow scholar, no matter how vehemently he disagrees with their theories. By the time the Characters have finished talking to him, the assistants are long gone. </span></p>\n<p>The Characters are unable to draw any information from the assistants except by threats. Holding them against their will is not a legal option as they have committed no crime. However, if the Characters manage to corner the assistants, they will not be captured without a fight. @Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Karl} tries to scurry away while @Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Gaius} stands and fights like a bull — to the death if necessary. Of course, if Gaius is captured it’s pointless trying to interrogate him — his silence is not voluntary: his tongue has been torn from its roots a long time ago (a self-inflicted trauma, done to prove his loyalty to the Yellow Fang). </p>\n<p>If @Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Zeigenalter} is somehow pinned down, he concocts all manner of false stories to cover his tracks. He never discloses his allegiance to the Yellow Fang however. There is a reason the cult chose these two to shadow @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Professor Hasche} — they are fanatically loyal to the Yellow Fang and would rather die than reveal its existence. @Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Zeigenalter} is an expert of escape, and when the Characters have their guard down, he can slip his bonds and vanish into the shadows. He’ll leave @Actor[uHv3JCT7sIJxJ4Z3]{Gaius} behind, knowing the secrets are safe with him. </p>\n<h3>Rewards</h3>\n<p>Good roleplaying and clever thinking should be rewarded, but there are additional XP for the following:</p>\n<p>@Exp[40, Fingered the culprits]{40 points for fingering the culprits}</p>\n<p>@Exp[30, Stopped the demonstration]{30 points for stopping the demonstration}</p>\n<p>@Exp[10, Investigated wheret he fakes came from]{10–50 points for investigating where the fakes came from}</p>\n<p>If Eunice is discredited in public reduce the Evidence Score by three.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-rat-torch.webp\" width=\"278\" height=\"417\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/the-dissection.webp","folder":"N77D1pRfRoOTueNx","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Cover Up","sort":100000}}}
{"_id":"aLnkS8QcTYXWLapv","name":"The Second Stratum — Axe Halls","content":"<p>These Halls once housed the Throng of Karak Skygg, regiments of Dwarf warriors devoted to defending the Hold. Across these levels, the walls are carved with a repeated axe motif. A ruined Temple of Grimnir is completely lost under mountains of slag from the Warpstone refineries above. These floors are dominated by the Great Hall, once the audience chamber for the King of the Hold, it has become a mustering place where Clan Skryre engineers select slaves for their work.</p>\n<h4>Barracks</h4>\n<p>There’s an irony that the chambers once used by stoic Dwarf warriors are now inhabited by filthy Skaven troops, huddled in stinking nests awaiting the orders of their Clan Skryre superiors. At all times, there are Clan Skryre @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{clanrats} and @Actor[DcBGKJTI6xFzE4PK]{Stormvermin} feeding, bickering and patrolling the corridors. Clan Skryre infantry are better equipped than that of other clans, utilising missile weapons such as the @Item[lP0b4ATxULZBpIvD]{Warplock jezzail} and @Item[YnFYheNBrpDmDtZ3]{poison wind globes}.</p>\n<p>If the party ventures into this area, describe the smell of close-packed Skaven bodies in crowded barracks rooms. Here and there, the lurid glow of a forge and the smell of smoke and hot metal indicate a workshop where weapons and armour are repaired. Gangs of slaves carrying food to the troops and suffering abuse are thrown rubbish as they pass through.</p>\n<p>The northern levels of the old barracks have been smashed through to incorporate a gigantic slag heap, where spoil from the refineries is dumped through holes from above. The old Temple of Grimnir is completely buried, and excess spoil falls from a ragged hole in the side of the mountain.</p>\n<h4>The Great Hall</h4>\n<p>When the King of Karak Skygg received guests, they would attend him here in his granite throne flanked by his Hammerers and advisors. The hall is dominated by a grand staircase leading upwards, though in places the masonry and stonework has fallen away leaving gaps in the staircase. All around are pillars supporting the ceiling above, each carved in the typical Dwarf manner, with ornate knots and runes. </p>\n<p>Now the throne is surmounted by a crude wooden platform where Warlock Engineers oversee the crowds of slaves ushered into the hall by their Packmasters. They pick work teams for their endeavours in the refineries or workshops, preferring those who they think are least likely to die before the job is done. At times, the hall is crowded with packs of slaves shoved towards the throne platform by their overseers.

Kratz was commander of the Clan Mange mercenaries betrayed by Clan Skryre, and it is his fate to watch the sorry remains of his forces enslaved and humiliated by the greater clan.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[322W7XoWqKEy7kWk]{Warlord Kratz}, Clan Mange General</h4>\n<p>Kratz was born from the same litter as Clawleader @Actor[gx1Nvw8AYjZdPPOi]{Rikkhin} who was trapped beneath @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt} during the events of @JournalEntry[Dj4BkkwyitJfK0NZ]{Black Hunger}. While Skaven have no real affection for their siblings, Clan Mange have a little more loyalty than most. If the party can tell him anything of Rikkhin’s fate, or the events of Brass Keep, he may believe them — and becomes both angry and frightened… a deadly combination in a powerful Skaven. The party will need to pick a moment when the @Actor[KAB3UZ20z9m8fUQ3]{Warlock Engineers} are distracted to talk with Kratz.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you doing here?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘What you care Man-things? Maliss great-great betrayal. Now he rub my snout in it — to shame-humble Clan Mange. How he chittered! “Great Warlord Kratz a slave now! Watch-watch, suffer-shame!”’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Do you know Rikkhin?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Clawleader Rikkhin? Brood-mate Rikkhin? Best of the rest of our litter, only tried to kill-kill me once. Why you ask man-thing?’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>We met him below Middenheim, betrayed by the other Skaven there.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Ah! Always Mange abused by rotten-bad clans. Too much trust-trust!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>What would happen if we freed you?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Gather Mange slaves, find Maliss, squeeze-squeeze neck until head pop off. Feed head to Wolf Rats. No… feed head to Mange slaves. Or eat head myself… will decide later.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Then what?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Conquer man-thing Empire, rule world.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If freed, Kratz will race through the hall and rush down to the slave pens to start freeing his Clanrats. This creates a major distraction, but he won’t ever reach @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Maliss} to squeeze off his head… nor will he conquer the Empire.</p>","folder":"DTYjZfJMc8xgYikO","sort":187500,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Locations","sort":187500}}}
{"_id":"afv76pWaAOK9O9VK","name":"They Grey Seers","content":"<p>The Grey Seers are powerful sorcerers, capable of channelling eldritch energies and unleashing them in scaring bolts of destruction. Their fur is typically grey, though some have white pelts or are albino. The bony horns sprouting from their heads mark them as the chosen of the vile Skaven God, the Great Horned Rat. The favour of the Horned Rat is not without its price however, and Grey Seers are often sickly and frail. These prophets also act as the Council of Thirteen’s chief agents and emissaries. These twin roles mean that Grey Seers wield tremendous influence in the Under-Empire. They possess a rank and position greater than all other Skaven barring the Lords of Decay themselves. This is not to say that Grey Seers are above the self-serving manipulations and treacherous scheming of the Skaven — indeed, they epitomise it. The Seers guard their power jealously, and it is a foolish Warlord indeed who does not immediately prostrate themselves at the feet of a Grey Seer and humbly acquiesce. The Rune of the Grey Seers is enough to strike fear into the hearts of friend and foe alike.</p>\n<p>After the Council of Thirteen, the Grey Seers are the most essential power base within Skavendom. They interpret the will of the Horned Rat, and through preaching his commandments they seek to provide Skaven society with drive, cohesion and common purpose. </p>\n<p>Without their influence it is doubtful that Skavendom could function. The Grey Seers’ guidance ensures a semblance of Skaven order. Skaven by their nature are chaotic and unruly: without the Seers they would be even more riven with violent dispute and acts of betrayal. Grey Seers are not benevolent in their ministrations. They are as likely to make their point though lethal demonstrations of the sorcerous power they possess through the Blessing of the Horned Rat as they are by proclaiming their god’s commandments.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/grey-seer-skrittar.webp\" width=\"298\" height=\"401\" /></div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[KFH0AfMtMRGNUU3b]{Grey Seer Skrittar}, Herald of The Council of Thirteen</h3>\n<p>The Grey Seer Skrittar is vain and power-mad — even for a Skaven. He travels with an  army of Skavenslaves, whose sole duty is to bow down before him. As Skrittar’s palanquin passes, these wretches stand up and run forwards so that wherever Skrittar looks there are at least a few dozen underlings abasing themselves. Any who are too slow or who dare look upon the Grey Seer’s horned form are consumed by searing bolts of sorcerous lightning that leap from Skrittar’s outstretched fingertips.</p>\n<h4>Palanquin Rules</h4>\n<p>Some important Skaven travel around atop litters borne by slaves and guarded by Stormvermin. Such platforms offer protection, extra fighters, and a more elaborate and visible display of power. There is a satisfying pomp about being carried around that appeals to a certain type of Skaven. Even better if the platform is bedecked with clan trophies, enemies’ skulls, and the relics of defeated rivals.  </p>\n<p>Characters mounted on a Palanquin Higher gain all of the usual bonuses for Mounted Combat, such as the +20 bonus to Melee Tests against smaller targets.</p>\n<h4>Palanquin Guards</h4>\n<p>Skrittar’s palanquin is borne aloft by four hulking Stormvermin. Each only needs one hand for the palanquin, so may use their free hand to attack. </p>\n<h4>Two Heads are Better than One</h4>\n<p>Skrittar is usually accompanied by a huge giant rat with two heads. Skrittar is not particularly sentimental about his pet, referring to it merely as ‘the Rat’. If anyone should be so obstinate as to ask which rat he refers to he blasts them with Warp Lightning.</p>\n<h4>Using Skrittar</h4>\n<p>Skrittar and his attendants travel widely throughout the Under-Empire ensuring that all lairs and strongholds are aware of the Council of Thirteen’s authority and the need to abide by the 169 Commandments of the Horned Rat. In particular, he is a promoter of the laws dictated by the Council that deny the practice of magic to all Skaven other than the Warlock Engineers and the Grey Seers. Therefore, there is something of the Witch Hunter about Skrittar, though his main motive for searching out and destroying other magic users has less to do with the fear of untrained magical practice, and more to do with megalomania and professional jealousy.</p>\n<h4>Skrittar and Under-Middenheim</h4>\n<p>Skrittar’s presence in Under-Middenheim would cause problems. @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Gnawretch Skrray} is a proud Warlord who would likely clash with the arrogant Seer. Gnawretch is one of the few Skaven in the Under-Empire who Skrittar could not merely execute with impunity: he is the favoured emissary of Warlord General Paskrit the Vast, who sits on the Council of Thirteen. As a herald of the Council, Skrittar could not merely despatch the favoured servants of those he calls master.</p>\n<p>But the two Skaven do have a common enemy in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.6FPPs62CQl2IRMJl]{Kanker Flett}, whose secretive worship of Nurgle would enrage the Grey Seer. If @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Gnawretch} could somehow set Skrittar and Fett on to each other, it would no doubt prove fatal for Fett. Then Gnawretch would have rid himself of a powerful rival and won the regard of the Seer with one stroke.</p>\n<h4>Skrittar and Clan Mange</h4>\n<p>Skrittar regards Clan Mange with wearied disdain. The fact that the clan place an emphasis on loyalty and professionalism disgusts the Grey Seer, who sees such qualities as distinctly unnatural. Skrittar may come to believe that the attack on Brass Keep is not a forlorn hope, but will actually result in the puny clan becoming a major player in Skavendom. He would therefore be desperate for anything that might contribute to Clan Mange’s downfall, or be grateful for news that the assault is hopeless (in which case he will become an enthusiastic supporter of the plan).</p>\n<h4>Skrittar and the Cult of the Yellow Fang</h4>\n<p>Skrittar loathes Humans, but understands their value as covert agents. He would be keen to leave the Yellow Fang at arm’s reach and let them help those Skaven who are more willing to interact with Humans.</p>\n<p>In their turn the Yellow Fang understand enough of Skaven society and lore to recognise that Skrittar is an authority to whom the other Skaven owe their obedience. As such they would treat him to fawning obedience if they were to learn of his presence.</p>\n<h4>Skrittar and Maliss Manrack</h4>\n<p>Skrittar is aware that the Council of Thirteen have granted @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack} the right to carry out Project Moonbreaker, and he has also been told by Seerlord Kritislik that the more resources are funnelled into the project, the more it will embarrass Clan Skryre.</p>\n<p>But Skrittar has a personal revulsion to the plan. To him Morrslieb is a sacred thing: he has bathed in the light of the moon on Vermintide and finds its baleful green light invigorating and calming. He regards damaging the moon as the highest form of sacrilege, and cannot understand why the Council of Thirteen have allowed Maliss to go ahead with his plans.</p>\n<p>So Skrittar might become an unlikely patron to the Characters, if he thinks they are set to destroy the Moonbreaker. If he can get them to disrupt @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Maliss Manrack’s} project without letting any of his fellow Skaven know about his involvement then it will be all the better for him. Skrittar’s goals are to look like a supporter of Maliss Manrack as far as his fellow Skaven are concerned, but protect Morrslieb from harm.</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/grey-seer-skrittar.webp","folder":"4D0HQOOQGBbb6EN3","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"History of the Skaven","sort":300000}}}
{"_id":"b3IUWHv3Td9hFvKK","name":"The Council of Thirteen","content":"<p>Skaven politics are labyrinthine and convoluted. Their society has been described by Bagrian, a Bretonnian Taalite priest who is an authority on the Skaven, as ‘a tyranny moderated through assassination’. For the teeming multitudes who make up the Warlord Clans this is effectively the case, but there is a higher order directing the grander schemes of Skavendom: the Council of Thirteen.</p>\n<p>The Council has antecedents. Shortly after the first Skaven emerged from Skavenblight they were met by twelve Grey Lords who directed them to spread across the world, and throughout the history of the Skaven leaders known as the Lords of Decay have remained their supreme commanders. The individual lords who made up this group changed, but there were always twelve of them, with the thirteenth place reserved for the Horned Rat — the monstrous god of the Skaven.</p>\n<p>After the poor performance of the Red Pox in 1850 IC, Skavendom descended into a civil war that was finally brought to a stop in 2302 IC. Sensing the rising tides of magic that accompanied the Chaos invasion of Kislev, the Grey Seers summoned representatives of the major clans to Skavenblight, and called on the Horned Rat to put an end to the conflict.</p>\n<p>The Horned Rat is said to have revealed the Black Pillar of Commandments. This unholy monument is made from purest Warpstone and has thirteen sides, each bearing thirteen dictats to be followed by his children. The 169 commandments vary from the ambiguous to the contradictory. The Horned Rat must have intended for the system to be as complex and intricate as possible. Scheming and plotting come naturally to Skaven, and the Great One draws endless amusements from the machinations of the Lords of Decay as they twist and turn within the convoluted laws.</p>\n<p>The Black Pillar of Commandments was also a test for any aspirants to the Council, as only the favoured of the Horned Rat could touch its rune-inscribed surface and survive. However, those that lived became the most powerful of all Skaven, gifted with unnatural longevity and imbued with dark power. The Horned Rat ordered all Skaven to obey his new Council, or else feel his wrath. The Skaven — notoriously craven — dared not defy their god or his favoured servants. The seats on the Council were occupied by the most wicked and cunning of Skaven. In times past any clan leader strong and devious enough could seize power if only he could depose a rival and ‘create’ a vacancy. However, not since the Second Civil War and the intervention of the Horned Rat at the Great Summoning have any challengers defeated, disposed of, or else supplanted any of the existing Lords of Decay.</p>\n<p>The current members on the Council of Thirteen have remained the same since the Great Summoning and subsequent unification of the Skaven in 2320 IC. Their position has waxed and waned with the power of their clan, and with the success and failure of their machinations. Indeed, as Clan Pestilens has risen in influence so has Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch’s position, and he currently sits on the tenth seat. However, Lord Kiltislik, Seerlord of all Skavendom, has sat as the right-hand claw of the Horned Rat since before the Great Summoning. He remains the most powerful of the Lords of Decay.</p>\n<p>The positions on the Council command a descending order of precedence. The first and twelfth places (the right and left hand of the Horned Rat) are the most important seats, and the sixth and seventh places are the least. However, any Lord of Decay can abstain, and by so doing veto a command from his opposite number. Hence, Lord Kritislik, the Seerlord, can (and frequently does) veto the orders of Lord Morskittar, the Lord-Warlock of Clan Skryre. This means that the Lords of Decay often need the help of others to set their schemes in motion. Thus the circle of maze-like plots continues, encouraging ever-shifting dynamics, blackmail, bribery, and all manner of corruption. Assassination attempts amongst the Lords of Decay are considered rather crude, but are not unheard of. It is more likely that the lower clans or even outside kingdoms are manipulated, which in turn affects the Council of Thirteen’s actions.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<p><em>The Council of Thirteen rune depicts the twelve Lords of Decay arrayed in order of influence. The personal runes of Lord Morskittar of Clan Skryre and Seerlord Kritislik can be seen to either side of the symbol of the Horned Rat. The runes for the other Lords of Decay run down in descending order until the 6th and 7th places, occupied by the relatively wretched thrall clan warlords, Pontifex Sitch of Morbidus, and Arch-Brutelord Hesh Vrakspine of Krizzor.</em></p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/council-of-thirteen.webp\" width=\"265\" height=\"283\" /></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>The Lords of Decay are always twelve in number, being completed symbolically by the Horned Rat. The first order of the Council of Thirteen prohibits the study of magic, so only Clan Skryre and the Grey Seers could pursue its use. (The enforcement of this law is not terribly exacting; Eshin Sorcerers and Pestilens Plague Priests often flout it, to the dismay of the Grey Seers.) It is the council’s role to unite the clans against the Skaven’s enemies and interpret the will of the Great Horned Rat. In truth, the Council of Thirteen is far more interested in pursuing its own nefarious plots and schemes, manipulating the lesser clans, and assassinating those who pose them the slightest threat.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Council members identify their position with an elaborate rune. In most cases, these sigils are adapted from a Lord of Decay’s Clan-symbol. But it is not unknown for a clan to adopt the personal icon of its leader. These runes, and endless subtle variations of them, are seen throughout each Lord of Decay’s clan. Similar markings are also seen amongst Thrall clans and other ‘allies’. Having links to a Lord of Decay is not something to keep secret — it is something to inspire dread and fear into rivals, and as such should be emblazoned as prominently and as often as possible.</em></p>\n<h3>The Council Ratifies Project moonbreaker</h3>\n<p>When @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack} informed Lord-Warlock Morskittar of Project Moonbreaker he received muted encouragement in response. Morskittar said he would raise it with the Council, but doubted it would receive support due to many Grey Seers prophesying a role for Morrslieb in years to come. At the next meeting of the council in Skavenblight Morskittar proposed the plan, hoping that the others would veto it. This is because he wanted to table an alternate plan by Warlock Bombadier Gnawlitch Shun to send a rocket to Morrslieb and commence mining operations on its surface. Morskittar had thought that if he proposed Maliss’s plan first the other lords would veto it, and he could then use their objections to justify this plan. He imagined they would veto the second as well, and therefore be wholly out of objections to his favourite plan, which was to sponsor the development of a teleportation device proposed by his most talented Warlock Engineer, the prodigious Ikit Claw.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Morskittar, Seerlord Kritislik immediately and enthusiastically supported @Actor[UUYKmNFjiMe4hw4j]{Maliss’s} plan to blow Morrslieb apart with the Moonbreaker. In truth, Kritislik hated the plan, but one of his spies had told him supporting it would lead to dismay amongst several senior Warlock Engineers to whom Morskittar had promised rewarding commissions.</p>\n<p>So Morskittar was left in the embarrassing situation of having to veto his own plan, which he did, saying he had second thoughts and now considered that imperfections in the execution of Project Moonbreaker could result in Morrslieb being hurled through space away from the world, or broken up into pieces that remained aloft rather than raining downward. Kritislik refused to accept Morskittar’s argument, and re-proposed the plan in turn, so it was up to the rest of the Council to break the deadlock.</p>\n<p>Lord Gnawdwell of Clan Mors leapt on the suggestion that Morrslieb might be knocked into space rather than shattered. Lord Kratch Doomclaw pointed out that Lord Gnawdwell predictably opposes anything Seerlord Kritislik suggests. This enraged Lord Gnawdwell’s sense of honour — because it was true — and he fired back that Kratch Doomclaw predictably opposes anything he deems to be in the interest of Clan Mors — which was also true.</p>\n<p>Grand Nightlord Sneek of Clan Eshin rarely advances his own opinions in council meetings, but this time his whispering voice hissed in support of Lord Gnawdwell. This enraged Gnawdwell further because he felt that the Nightlord was so widely distrusted by the other Lords of Decay that his support could only undermine Gnawdwell’s position. Warlord General Paskrit the Vast and Arch-Sealord Vrisk Ironscratch more or less proved his point by immediately and vociferously siding with the Seerlord.</p>\n<p>He-who-is-eleventh, Packlord Verminkin of Clan Moulder, held a conference with himself for a while, but his heads came to a consensus and effectively vetoed Gnawdwell’s objections to the Seerlord. </p>\n<p>Lord Gnawdwell became apoplectic, accusing the Packlord of possessing such heedless greed for Warpstone that it had robbed him of reason, the Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch VII of having addled the council’s wits with a magically induced fever, and Vrisk Ironscratch of harbouring parasitic barnacles in his brains. This loss of temper heralded the end of negotiations as Gnawdwell effectively lost what little support remained for his position. Paskrit the Vast, Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch and Vrisk Ironscratch immediately voted to approve the plan.</p>\n<p>Arch-Pontifex Sitch pretended to ponder his position for a while, before doing exactly as he always does and voting in support of Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack} was granted permission to assemble a small army and occupy the lost hold of Karak Skygg in the Middle Mountains in order to construct and test his Moonbreaker cannon.</p>\n<h4>Embittered Engineers</h4>\n<p>So Morskittar returned to Clan Skryre’s holdings in Skavenblight and informed his engineers of the news. Chief Warlock Engineer Ikit Claw was bitterly disappointed that his planned research into the construction of a teleportation device was being shelved. To cope with his feelings of rejection, he has turned his attention once again to Project Doomsphere, a mighty Warpbomb that could engulf the world in nuclear fire (a project that has Seerlord Kritislik’s approval, though he would never be so lacking in diplomacy as to actually voice his enthusiasm for it).</p>\n<p>Gnawlitch Shun was contacted via Farsqueaker and told to stand down his preparations for a rocket to the moon. Gnawlitch was outraged, but promised not to interfere with Maliss’s plans for the Moonbreaker cannon. He was pacified mostly by the promises that when Maliss eventually did harvest a rain of Warpstone meteors Clan Skryre would be enriched and in the position to fund research into many new exciting projects.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/council-vote.webp\" width=\"388\" height=\"771\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/moonbreaker.webp","folder":"4D0HQOOQGBbb6EN3","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"History of the Skaven","sort":200000}}}

He finds the Characters at @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.JAi2HLfYRkYwLC63]{The Templar’s Arms}, or wherever else they are staying. Alphonse has various contacts at the court, especially among the kitchen staff, and has heard rumours of the Characters’ problem-solving abilities.

{"_id":"c0DYAS0qQIR3hiXl","name":"Hovelhof","content":"<p>Hovelhof is a small impoverished village, perched atop a high hill with spectacular views eastward to the mountains and southward to Middenheim. The air is sweet and clear, the upland meadows lush, and the sky is a vibrant, cloudless blue. A handful of squat huts clusters around the green, and the village is ringed by goat and cattle pens.

Characters who are used to being able to bribe inn staff for information on other guests, access to their rooms, or other dubious purposes find themselves facing a polite but impregnable show of incomprehension when they ask for such things at the <em>Fox and Crown</em>. Those who become angry or troublesome will be politely asked to leave, or their food is drugged with both @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-items.XhzxqkiSTuOFaLJN]{Schlafenkraut} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-items.kTRVWXs9H5K4Zfir]{Slowmind} so that they fall into a deep sleep and awake many hours later on a distant hillside with all their belongings set down beside them — and a case of hypothermia, if it happens to be winter.</p>\n<h3>Hohenfahrt</h3>\n<p>The tiny hamlet of Hohenfahrt is ruled directly from Middenheim, being part of the City-State. It is not wealthy, but its people make a little money harvesting timber from the surrounding forest, quarrying slate in the foothills of the Middle Mountains, and serving travellers at the inn.</p>\n<p>The village has shrines to both Sigmar and Ulric. There is no sign of the religious strife that is so evident elsewhere in Middenland, and if they are asked, the villagers will simply reply that it is better to get along with everyone and be good neighbours rather than bad. The followers of Sigmar and Ulric fought side by side in the Great War, and with mutant births and Beastmen activity on the rise, it is unwise to let anything divide the Empire’s people. The Graf, the Emperor and the priests are wise and educated men, so surely they can resolve any religious differences reasonably, without any need for unpleasantness.</p>\n<p>Notable buildings along the main street include a lumberyard surrounded by a 6-ft plank palisade, another yard with cut slates piled up to more than the height of a man, a carter’s stable with four heavy carts in the yard and about a dozen draft horses resting in stalls. There’s a small tavern called the Mill, where only locals are welcome; a slightly larger tavern called the <em>Foresters’ Arms</em>, which is friendlier, and a village shop that sells everything from tools to preserved foods. A local market is held on Marktag and Angestag afternoons, dealing in fresh meats and vegetables from surrounding farms.</p>\n<p>Smaller side-streets lead off to either side of the road, leading to clusters of modest cottages where most of the villagers live. After a hundred yards or so, the buildings peter out and the road begins to climb into the foothills.</p>\n<h4>The Foresters’ Arms</h4>\n<p>The first building the Characters come to is an inn called the <em>Foresters’ Arms</em>. It is a two-storey building, the lower level made of stone and the upper floor of timber, with a walled courtyard containing stables, various outbuildings, and a well.</p>\n<p>If the PCs arrive in Hohenfahrt late in the day, they should be able to find lodging here: room rates and all other prices are 10% above normal as the innkeeper takes advantage of the heavier traffic on the road as Carnival-goers return home from Middenheim. As the PCs sit down to their evening meal in the inn’s bar-room, begin the event <em>Suspicious Behaviour</em>.</p>\n<h3>Suspicious Behaviour</h3>\n<p>Quartermaster Habicht at the Picket is corrupt, and he has been purchasing poor quality gunpowder from a contact in Salzenmund to disguise the fact that he is passing on the Picket’s much better powder to Sergeant Brantner, who in turn passes it on to the Skaven. Habicht has paid for the services of a woman called @Actor[5UlC6nsMTnzN9ZHB]{Valeria Roth} to ferry the different grades of gunpowder to their intended destinations. She knows Karl and Gaius at the Collegium Theologica, who pass it on to the Skaven.</p>\n<p>@Actor[5UlC6nsMTnzN9ZHB]{Valeria’s} cover is that she regularly delivers kegs of ale to the picket, and returns with the empty kegs. A few extra barrels of gunpowder amongst her stock are easily overlooked. Valeria is staying at the <em>Foresters’ Arms</em> when the Characters arrive. She is a professional smuggler, and a follower of Ranald. She knows that her work could be linked to sinister activities — gunpowder is dangerous stuff after all — but were she to learn that her work assists the Skaven she would be very confused and upset.</p>\n<p>The last time she was in Middenheim, @Actor[5UlC6nsMTnzN9ZHB]{Valeria} was told to look out for people of the Characters’ descriptions. Karl and Gaius warned her that the Characters were working for Middenheim’s Watch, and might investigate the activities of a smuggler such as herself. Once the Characters have settled in the inn Valeria approaches them, pretending to be a friendly local. Curious about an unusual group of armed strangers travelling along this quiet route, she attempts to engage them in conversation and find out their business. If Valeria is rebuffed or provided with an unconvincing story, she becomes suspicious, and tries to eavesdrop on their conversation without being detected.</p>\n<p>If she confirms her suspicion that the Characters are on the way to the Picket, @Actor[5UlC6nsMTnzN9ZHB]{Valeria} leaves the inn hurriedly and rushes to there to warn Habicht. If a Character is looking at Valeria and passes a <strong>Hard (–10) Perception</strong> Test, they notice that she seems to be alarmed. If the Characters try to question her, she makes some excuse about feeling unwell. If she must, she tries to sneak or fight her way from the inn, steals a horse — perhaps from the Characters — and rides towards the Picket. What she lacks in guile, she more than makes up in agility, and she will be very difficult for the Characters to catch.</p>\n<p>If she is caught, @Actor[5UlC6nsMTnzN9ZHB]{Valeria} claims that she ran because she is a deserter from the Picket and does not want to be taken back there. If the Characters force her to return to the Picket, she does cooperate sulkily — though a successful <strong>Hard (–10) Intuition</strong> Test reveals that her mood is feigned, and she is actually eager to reach it — she hopes to slip away and warn Habicht.</p>\n<p>@Actor[5UlC6nsMTnzN9ZHB]{Valeria Roth}</p>\n<h3>The Mountain Road</h3>\n<p>Along the road to Lindenheim, the Characters may encounter villagers travelling to Middenheim for supplies, trappers bringing meat and furs to sell, or herders driving sheep or goats out of the foothills to market.</p>\n<p>More rarely, they may meet with military personnel heading to or from the Picket on a number of errands: carts carrying supplies, new recruits being marched out from Middenheim, or the few lucky officers who secured passes for Carnival Week returning to their posts after a spell in the city. If the Characters talk about their mission to any military types, though, there is a chance that whatever they say finds its way back to Quartermaster Habicht or worse, Sergeant Brantner, which could make their lives considerably more difficult.</p>\n<h4>Lindenheim Trading Post</h4>\n<p>Lindenheim is a small trading post with a surrounding community of smallholders and foresters. There is a simple inn here called the <em>Orchard View</em>. No orchard can be seen from the inn, and food served here is poor quality, if served at all.</p>\n<h4>Ferlangst Tower</h4>\n<p>Ferlangst Tower is a small fortification used as a waystation on the supply route to the Picket. It is one of the forts in the area owned by the Kärzburdger family where the Characters can get a meal and a safe place to spend the night. However, Heinrich von Kärzburdger is currently in residence. If the Characters upset him during their audience with the Graf, he does not allow them to rest at the castle, even if they present him with the Todbringer charter.</p>\n<h4>Mittler Castle</h4>\n<p>Mittler Castle is another way station. However, it is just an old ruin, destroyed and scavenged for stone that was used to build Ferlangst Tower. It is an eerie spot and only relatively sheltered in comparison to the rocky mountain sides that surround it. The Characters could camp here for the night, but it is a forlorn sight, and the perfect place for any pursuers to spring an ambush.</p>\n<h4>Hope Square</h4>\n<p>Hope Square is a penal colony; wretched chain gangs make their way through the clustered buildings and into the mines. A statue of Sister Hildegunde, the Shallyan reformer who promoted prison as an alternative to execution, stands in the middle of the square. Travellers are not encouraged to stop at Hope Square, but the guards at the penal colony find a place for the Characters to sleep if they show the Todbringer charter.</p>\n<h4>Rewards</h4>\n<p>Good roleplaying and clever thinking should be rewarded, but there are additional XP for the following: </p>\n<p>@Exp[20, Interrogated the Smuggler]{20 points for interrogating the Smuggler}</p>\n<p>@Exp[20, Dealt with any Yellow Fang agents following on the road]{20 points for dealing with any Yellow Fang agents following on the road}</p>","folder":"qPSOCqWeY1xLP2vT","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Road East","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"cKxMqupzYtcrYJPH","name":"Proponents of Controversy","content":"<p>This section of the adventure revolves around an audience with Middenheim’s Graf. One way or another he has heard of the Characters’ investigations and seeks to learn more. </p>\n<h2>Facing the Facts</h2>\n<p>It is up to the GM to decide when the call is put out to the Characters to present themselves at the palace. The best option would be for them to exhaust the leads and challenges described in the first part of the adventure, whereupon @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann} informs them that the Graf wishes to hear their report. If the Characters have made slow progress, then this development can still occur in order to prevent the adventure grinding to a halt, though the Characters are at a disadvantage when it comes to getting the Graf to take them seriously.</p>\n<p>Even if the Characters have done a poor job uncovering evidence and confronting their enemies, the Graf still wishes to see them, though in such a circumstance he will be more motivated to have them account for the mess they have created than listen to them make a case for their investigation.</p>\n<p>The Characters could also instigate this meeting themselves by suggesting the authorities in Middenheim take direct action against the Skaven. If this is the case, Schutzmann can have them chase up any remaining leads whilst he arranges for them to see the Graf. After all, Middenheim’s  ruler cannot be presumed to meet with adventurers at the drop of a hat — even if they did save his life.</p>\n<h3>The @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.16KsfNTgXYLtRib9]{Middenpalaz}</h3>\n<p>As the Characters enter the waiting room they are shown to their seats by a page in Todbringer livery. The anteroom is grand in and of itself — draped in slate-blue tapestries depicting the legends of Ulric in fine silver embroidery. Richly upholstered chairs line the room. A middle-aged man with a long full silver beard wearing sumptuous clothing sits with impeccable posture in one of the chairs. He stares intently at the party. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Heraldry) </strong>Test identifies him as wearing icons associated with the von Helstein family, who own small estates at the Graf ’s pleasure throughout the Grand Duchy of Middenheim.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Hausmeister Breugal} is the cold and formal Chamberlain of the Graf, and it is he who decides who gets to see Middenheim’s ruler  and when, if at all. Just as the Characters are ushered into the anteroom, Breugal opens the great door to the audience chamber and in stentorian tones says, ‘ <em>Your excellency, I present to you the Count von Helstein</em>’. At this the man in the chair rises gracefully and enters the audience room with purposeful strides. Breugal closes the door behind him leaving the Characters alone.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FAMILIAR FACES</em></h3>\n<p><em>Many of the NPCs in this chapter have featured prominently in the events of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, and you may find more details on their personalities and goals in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> and its Companion volume. The essential details have been presented here, so if you don’t have access to those books don’t panic! If you do be sure to pepper in further details and idiosyncracies, and call back to earlier interactions the NPC may have had with the Characters.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Eavesdropping</h3>\n<p>Characters can listen at the door. On an <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test they catch snatches of the conversation through the wall, enough to tell that the Graf is gently chastising the Count for swelling his retinue of armed men beyond the number they had previously agreed, whilst von Helstein is apologetic, he complains that his estate must be allowed to defend itself. <em>‘My lord, our holdings around Nordringen are beset by plagues and reavers from Nordland, and we worry about arguments with the Reikland that may need, ultimately, to be settled upon the field.’</em></p>\n<h4>A Diplomatic Incident</h4>\n<p>At this point an elderly nobleman enters the anteroom and takes a seat near the Characters, he wears his white beard long and wild, and is dressed in fine puffed and slashed clothing made from red taffeta that has become faded and worn. A successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Heraldry) </strong>Test identifies him as wearing icons associated with the Kärzburdger family, who enjoy hereditary tenure of a large estate to the north east of the Grand Duchy of Middenheim. This is Henricus von Kärzburdger, who the Characters may have met at the @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.7mDua1hGnhaa92uU]{Garden Party} as described in the <strong>Power Behind the Throne Companion</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A CURT KÄRZBURDGER </em></h3>\n<p><em>Henricus tips his hat to the Characters and strikes up a conversation. Whilst he seems friendly, he is a touchy man who tends to take offence at the smallest slights, and the Characters may unwittingly cause trouble.</em></p>\n<p>‘A good day to you all, so you are here to meet with his Excellency the Graf?’</p>\n<p><em>Allow the Characters to respond.</em></p>\n<p>‘And you are here at the right time? Breugal has arranged it so that you may speak to him once he is finished with the Count?’</p>\n<p><em>If the Characters say yes he responds:</em></p>\n<p>‘Are you ennobled and sincere in your devotions to Ulric? Where do you keep your estates?’</p>\n<p><em>If the Characters cannot convince Henricus that they are both devoted Ulricans and landed aristocrats, he grows angry, lurches to his feet and proclaims:</em></p>\n<p>‘By the claws and teeth of the White Wolf! Do they think I will abide by this disgrace? My line may have diminished as the fortunes of the Todbringers have waxed, but I will not be obliged to wait as the Graf gossips with the likes of you. Poxes and agues upon thee!’</p>\n<p><em>Henricus is determined to storm off in a self-righteous huff (he enjoys playing the part of persecuted scion of a once great line), but it would be wise for the Characters to try to mollify him as much as possible. If they insist he take their place in the queue he assents, though they must then wait for a while whilst he gripes to Graf Boris about nothing in particular. Their treatment of him might affect how they are treated in turn later in the adventure.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/boris-todbringer.webp\" width=\"223\" height=\"296\" /></div>\n<h3>An Audience with the Graf</h3>\n<p>Finally the Characters are admitted to the audience chamber. The Graf is seated on his throne and there are several other people in attendance.  An honour guard, three Knights Panther and three Knights of the White Wolf, are arrayed about him. @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{‘Princess’ Katarina} sits to one side. She is quiet throughout the audience, but anyone who pays her attention sees she is listening intently. Middenheim’s snobbish Knight Eternal @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll} is also in attendance, resplendent in his bright armour, and @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal} remains by the main door, which is also flanked by two Knights Panther. </p>\n<h3>The Role of Prunkvoll</h3>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Prunkvoll} may be something of an ignoramus, but in this circumstance he has been encouraged to speak. He is not easily impressed, especially if the Characters performed badly under @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulric Schutzmann’s} direction. He is here because he makes a perfect, if unwitting, devil’s advocate. He is such a snob that even if he comes to find the Characters credible he still finds fault in their account. </p>\n<p>But @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Prunkvoll} is also developing a distrust of Altdorf, the Emperor, and Sigmarites — similar to the distrust that has been growing in Middenheim recently. He is all too ready to believe, as Graf Boris does, that the plot the Characters thwarted in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> had nothing to do with Chaos, but was part of a Sigmarite conspiracy to seize control of northern provinces, suppress the cult of Ulric, and see to it that Karl-Franz is made an absolute ruler with the cult of Sigmar as an established state religion.</p>\n<p>@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Prunkvoll} stands beside the Graf throughout the audience, making sarcastic remarks that support the Graf’s doubts and fears, while undermining whatever the Characters say. The GM can use him to complicate the Characters’ task, and also to show the darkening mood that is growing in the region.</p>\n<p>A few comments are given below as examples, and the GM should feel free to improvise more during play. While it may be enjoyable for the GM to play @Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Prunkvoll} to the hilt, and ridicule everything the Characters say, he stops short of open heckling. If necessary, the Graf will issue a stern word and Prunkvoll settles into a resentful silence, expressing his opinions with tuts, sighs, eye-rolls, and muttered words like ‘Altdorf,’ ‘likely story,’ and ‘must think we’re stupid’.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/siegfried-prunkvoll.webp\" width=\"273\" height=\"296\" /></div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[6yFVH9mzC5VoQAUh]{Siegfried Prunkvoll}</div>\n<h3>The Graf’s Questions</h3>\n<p>Questions that the Graf might ask initially are listed below. There is no firm script for this scene, and the GM should feel free to let the conversation go where it will. The Characters’ answers prompt the Graf to ask further questions. Whenever the discussion begins to lose steam or veers too far from the immediate topic, the Graf can switch to another question. The conversation should touch upon all of these topics, at least in passing, before the scene ends.</p>\n<h4>Did you recover the stolen relic?</h4>\n<p>Mindful of eavesdroppers, the Graf does not name the Helm of the Ratslayer himself, and tries to prevent any of the Characters from doing so. His disappointment is obvious if the Characters admit that they were unable to catch the thieves, his relief restrained if they did.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘So what you’re saying is, you failed and you have no idea where the relic is.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Skaven, you say? Surely they are extinct — or never existed?</h4>\n<p>The Graf is taking the official line in denying the existence of Skaven, but if the Characters are detailed in their descriptions of the creatures they encountered, and tell of their previous run-ins with the Ratmen, he may be convinced. If he is told of the stolen documents, and shown any fragments that the Characters recovered with text that concerns Skaven, his mood grows grim. The thought that the Ratmen are real, that they can move freely in Middenheim’s Undercity without detection, and that they take deliberate pains to ensure that the surface-dwellers know as little as possible about them — all these are deeply worrying.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘So what you’re saying is Mandred didn’t kill them all? So he didn’t deserve to be Emperor? Sounds like Sigmarite propaganda to me.’</p>\n<p>‘Oh, yes, Skaven — no doubt. I’ve seen them dancing at the Laughing Jackass on a Festag night.’</p>\n<p>‘So Middenheim’s sewer jacks are all blind, stupid, or paid off — is that it?’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>The other books were about warpstone and Morrslieb? What do you make of that?</h4>\n<p>The Characters can explain about the Skaven who stole warpstone from Castle Wittgenstein, if they have not already done so. They may also recall Dagmar von Wittgenstein’s notes on Morrslieb’s movements  and the falls of warpstone meteorites, and infer that there is some connection. The Graf listens to their arguments, nodding gravely, and tugs on a bell-pull that hangs beside his chair. When a liveried flunkey appears, he orders the servant to ‘get Helseher back here, along with anyone from the Collegium who had documents stolen.’</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Clever, that — leaving a few clues behind so we know what they took. Almost as though they wanted us to think they were Skaven.’</p>\n<p>‘Warpstone falling from the sky? Of course. Couldn’t be gold or bread, now, could it?’</p>\n<p>‘ You’re sure it wasn’t cheese they took? The two can look an awful lot alike, you know.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>You say that these Skaven plan a major attack? Why do you think so?</h4>\n<p>If the Graf is told any information that might indicate the Skaven are drawing up plans to attack Brass Keep or making other aggressive military moves, he will try to get the Characters to divulge more information and elaborate on their investigation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Oh, so not only have we walking rat creatures living beneath our feet, but they have been reading Allurian’s War Studies.’</p>\n<p>‘Whipping the Kärzburdgers up against us would certainly please Altdorf.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Ehrlich tells me you played a role in exposing Wasmeier and saving the city. Tell me what you know — briefly. As far as you know, are any conspirators still at large?</h4>\n<p>The Graf is serious about wanting a brief report, and cuts off any Character who goes into too much detail. His main question concerns surviving conspirators, which is the Characters’ cue to tell him about the Purple Hand. </p>\n<p>Of course, in your version of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> the Characters may already be known to the Graf, in which case he takes a brief moment to acknowledge their accomplishments.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘My lord, we’d know about a Chaos cult that size in the city. Altdorf ’s pointing the finger away from itself again.’</p>\n<p>‘ You met agents of this Purple Hand in Altdorf, did you? So how do you know that’s not their headquarters? I’d believe that sooner than Middenheim.’</p>\n<p>‘Where did Wasmeier study law? I bet it was Altdorf.’</p>\n<p>‘So you’re saying half the court was blackmailed, hypnotised, and — what, generally magicked — into betraying the city and murdering the Graf ? You’ve not been in town long, have you, or you’d know Middenheimers aren’t so easily swayed.’</p>\n<p>‘Be careful what you say about Ar-Ulric. Talk like that will get you burned — if you live to see the stake.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What do you know of Wallenstein? Is his disappearance somehow a part of all this?</h4>\n<p>The Graf will also be interested in anything the adventures can tell him about the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.2MRaArPormiaINVZ]{Jade Sceptre} and the fate — and true identity — of @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.7b3n85kojlLKSpkT]{Gotthard von Wittgenstein}. He makes plain his intention to root out these two cults from every part of the city.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Another cult? And the Temple of Ulric’s full of Beastmen, too, I suppose?’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>A Chaos cult in Middenheim? No — wait — two of them? That’s impossible. As the Knight Eternal says, no cult could grow so large and powerful without being detected. No — this comes from Altdorf.</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘They always wanted to control you, my lord. Middenheim and Ulric dominate the north, and Altdorf doesn’t like that.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Making the Case</h4>\n<p>At the end of this interview, it is time for the Characters to see how well they have made the case for the existence of Skaven and the degree to which they have convinced Middenheim’s rulers  that Chaos cults and Skaven activity trouble the area.</p>\n<p>In order to see how well they have performed, ask each of the Characters who spoke at the meeting to make  <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test.

She is becoming increasingly aware of her ability to influence events, and seeks to avert disaster. In particular, she does not share the suspicion of Altdorf and Sigmar held by her father and Prunkvoll. As a worshipper of Shallya, Katarina  finds Ulrican chauvinism rather alienating. She cannot muster much political or military support without her father’s cooperation, but her backing can help the Characters procure resources and open doors.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.czIY275tUC4VGDWp]{Boris’s} support is a true watershed — if he is won over the Characters are well on the way to proving their case to wider Middenheim society.

Middenheim’s noble lords would not be so foolish and vulgar as to merely hand over sacks of gold crowns, but if the Characters were to wish to go shopping they could spend the listed amount at the expense of their supporters.</p>\n<p>The type of gear available to buy depends on the supporter.</p>\n<p><strong>Katarina</strong>: Tools and Kits, Books and Documents, Packs and Containers, Clothing and Accessories, Rations, Herbs and Draughts, Prosthetics, Miscellaneous Trappings.</p>\n<p><strong>Graf Boris</strong>: The same as Katarina’s list plus Animals and Vehicles, Weapons, Ammunition, Armour.</p>\n<p><strong>Prunkvoll</strong>: The same as Katarina’s and Boris’s list plus various Alchemical treatments and Poisons (not that Prunkvoll is a procurer of such things, but more that his level of support indicates that the situation is desperate enough to employ them as measures).</p>\n<h4>Encounters Allayed</h4>\n<p>During the final stages of the adventure the Empire begins to descend into the chaos of internecine conflict, and agents of the Skaven try to prevent the Characters from achieving their goals.</p>\n<p>There are eight different encounters detailed in @JournalEntry[u9r9bXmLPG5No92t]{Encounters}, and whilst it is up to the GM to decide exactly how and when to spring them on the party, we recommend at least six of them are employed as the Characters home in on the situation at Brass Keep.</p>\n<p>However the more support they get from powerful NPCs, the greater the collective effort to curb unruly elements and suppress Skaven activity. This means that the Characters are less likely to face additional difficulties during their investigations.</p>\n<p>So if @Actor[PrkWVIr7Go4u1QWp]{Katarina} is the only supporter, the Characters should face six to eight encounters; whilst if Prunkvoll is brought on board, they should only face three to five encounters.</p>\n<h4>Middenheimers’ Attitudes </h4>\n<p>The final effect of making a good (or bad) case is that word starts to spread through Middenheim, causing a general improvement (or regress) in people’s willingness to face up to the scale of the Skaven threat.</p>\n<p>This is not a sudden shift, but occurs over the week following the interview as news of the Characters’ report spreads throughout the city.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>WE RIDE FOR BRASS KEEP!</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Characters may well feel at this point that they have justified reasons for heading to Brass Keep with all possible haste. There is a problem though, the lands around Brass Keep are part of the Duchy of Middenheim, but they are not ruled by Boris Todbringer. The keep lies within the Kärzburdger estate, and the Kärzburdger family are not on friendly terms with the Todbringers.</em></p>\n<p><em>If the Characters suggest that they should head for Brass Keep at this juncture, Prunkvoll explains the issue.</em></p>\n<p><em>‘We must exercise restraint. Hereditary tenure of the lands around the keep is held by the Kärzburdgers. They used to be Grafs of Middenheim before the ascent of the Todbringers, and they would not take kindly to those they perceive as being agents of the Graf poking about in their estates. We must respect their rights to manage their lands, and approach them according to protocol. Were you to journey there before we have explained the situation to them — they may hang you as spies.’</em></p>\n<p><em>The Characters may try to wrangle, but the view of those in power is that more must be done to illustrate an existential threat before troubling the Kärzburdgers.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>The Investigation Continues</h4>\n<p>Within a few hours of their meeting with the Graf, the Characters are summoned to another meeting with @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann}. Once they are within his office, he sits down and says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘ You must have impressed someone, I have been given permission to inform you of three local cases that bear marked similarities to the phenomena you have been investigating. I have been holding off on sending the Watch in to deal with these matters, as I believe you are better equipped to work out what is going on.’</p>\n<p>‘Speaking unofficially, I have received word that a charter is being arranged to send you to Brass Keep as official envoys of the Graf in order to observe conditions there, but it is a tricky process negotiating with the von Kärzburdgers. In the meantime, if you look into these three sites and recover more evidence, it will be of great assistance in securing this permission.’ </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Schutzmann then outlines the three cases the party should look into:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘There have been complaints about odd smells emanating from an area to the north of the Altmarkt, the sort you might associate with vermin. We spoke with the Ratters’ Guild about it, but they complained that it wasn’t worth visiting the place because there were no rats to be caught. Given that a number of storage facilities are there this seems strange indeed.’ <em>See @JournalEntry[Dj4BkkwyitJfK0NZ]{The Black Hunger}.}<br /></em></p>\n<p>‘A man has been brought to the Temple of Morr with strange green-tinged injuries. He was a miner from Unterfraus in the Barony of Holzbek, two days hard ride to the east. The Pedlar who brought him to Middenheim is still in town, lodged at the Regent’s House. We have told him not to leave until you have spoken with him.’ <em>See @JournalEntry[VUzXBxceijEeDp2a]{The Stolen Village}.}</em></p>\n<p>‘Finally, his Lordship Baron Holzbek has beseeched the Graf for assistance. He claims his own troops are tied up protecting his lands from raiding Goblins, but that recently he has heard disturbing reports of roaring noises near the village of Gladbeich, and a creature described as a rat-faced mutant seen nearby. Holzbek has been less than honest in the past, but you could stop off on the way to Unterfraus and see if there is any justification for concern.’  <em>See @JournalEntry[YwqPynt8yn40maei]{Griffon Down}.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-shield-rat.webp\" width=\"263\" height=\"203\" /></div>","folder":"8qYTCLGQezkZT0n9","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Proponents of Controversy","sort":0}}}

{"_id":"eKyqk9CWnuaJgUFV","name":"Undercity Encounters","content":"<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Middenheim’s Undercity} is a sprawling complex of ever-changing tunnels. It has never been adequately mapped, and any attempt to do so would be out of date before it saw print. In more than 2,500 years, no attempt to clear the tunnels has been successful: every few generations a Graf tries, and many lives are lost in the attempt. This is not a dungeon to be cleared room by room until the monsters are dead: it is a living environment whose inhabitants react to intruders; a food chain whose top spot is certainly not occupied by anyone from the surface.</p>\n<h3>The Sewers </h3>\n<p>The sewer system is cut through the rock of the Fauschlag. Because of the hard granite, the culverts are narrow, and rarely built with walkways or bridges. Architects have taken advantage of natural fissures in the rock, and the sewers twist and turn. In places the sewage seeps through pre-existing formations, opening into natural caverns where the water is wide, still, and fetid.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere the system is lined with walls constructed of rock left over from excavations.</p>\n<p>Most sewer courses terminate at the face of the Fauschlag, so despite its labyrinthine complexity, following the simple rule of heading downhill usually leads to the light of day. The locations where the sewage emerges are easily found from the outside. They are marked by long, brown stains smeared down the Fauschlag, and are guarded by iron grilles that are regularly inspected.</p>\n<h3>The Upper Tunnels</h3>\n<p>Dating back to Dwarf excavations for Artur’s original settlement, this network extends beneath the city. Parts of it are home to Dwarfs and much of it is utilised by Middenheimers. The long, dead-straight passages, vaulted cellars, massive cisterns, and spacious warehouses are as impressive as any construction above ground. Neatly cut Dwarf structures are easily distinguished from later human works. Much of the network has been forgotten, even by the Dwarfs.</p>\n<p>Though not intentional, the sewer network often intersects with the structures of the upper tunnels. This is caused by previously unknown natural routes through the rock, by cave-ins, or by deliberate tunnelling through to the sewers for illicit reasons.</p>\n<h3>The Lower Tunnels</h3>\n<p>Apart from the deeper digging of ancient Dwarfs, the Fauschlag’s lower tunnels are naturally formed from ancient faults, the upwards flow of hot springs, the drainage of rainwater, and even the mysterious venting of magical winds.</p>\n<p>The deepest tunnels beneath the Fauschlag eventually link to the vast Skaven Under-Empire that reaches every corner of the Old World. The rat-men know these routes almost instinctively; otherwise they are unknowable and unmappable.</p>\n<p>The Under-Empire is the Skaven’s greatest secret and greatest weapon, allowing them access to every corner of the Old World without risking exposure to their surface-dwelling enemies. Warbands regularly patrol the commonly used tunnels, outposts are set up at strategic locations, and spies are everywhere.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/sewer.webp\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/sewer.webp","folder":"Dl2LHPFH2e0EVlZ0","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Undercity Encounters","sort":100000}}}

Sliding double barn doors open from the yard, and there is a smaller personal door on one panel of the sliding doors and on one side of the warehouse. All are closed and secured with <strong>Difficult (–10)</strong> locks.</p>\n<p>Inside is a maze of crates and barrels, all labelled for delivery around the Empire. Most are fakes, awaiting use as containers for contraband. In an open area at the rear of the warehouse, a wooden trap door in the floor is closed but not locked, leading to the basement lair of @Actor[Sy0829M1A3fxm57R]{Vizier Bhar}. By the back wall, partially hidden behind boxes, a rope leads from the office in the loft down through the floor. @Actor[jgxJGa2BF4yyh1p7]{Theodor} uses this to communicate warnings to Bhar.</p>\n<p>Also at the rear, wooden stairs climb to a loft where the office and dovecote are. Unless the Characters pass an <strong>Average (+20) Stealth</strong> Test, they disturb the pigeons, which leads to the noises of panicked birds that awakens @Actor[jgxJGa2BF4yyh1p7]{Theodor} and his dogs on a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test.</p>\n<p>The office doubles as @Actor[jgxJGa2BF4yyh1p7]{Theodor’s} living quarters, which he  shares with three large mastiffs (@Actor[kM3M2goakQWEqrXB]{Brute, Force, and Bettë}) he keeps in case one of Bhar’s experiments goes berserk.

He rarely leaves, instead passing orders through @Actor[jgxJGa2BF4yyh1p7]{Theodor}.

Characters with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent automatically see a heavy presence of Dhar.</p>\n<h4>The Laboratory</h4>\n<p>The stairs lead to Bhar’s laboratory, a mad combination of Necromantic and Daemonological equipment. A rectangle 30 by 40 ft in size with a grey stone floor and thick walls, there are three dissection tables, each with a flayed cadaver strapped to it, one weakly struggling against its bonds. Worktables are laden with alchemical equipment all filled with colourful bubbling liquids. At the far end is an octagonal summoning star, drawn in blood and surrounded by a large copper ring. Two solid wooden doors on the right-hand wall lead out.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[jgxJGa2BF4yyh1p7]{Theodor} warns @Actor[Sy0829M1A3fxm57R]{Bhar}, he summons the @Actor[DXEQ6kiKpNGVcj4W]{Blue Horror} bound to the octagram and releases the zombies from the cold storage room. Casting an initial round of spells, he flees to his private chamber and through the secret door into @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Middenheim’s Undercity}, to seek refuge with his Skaven allies.</p>\n<p>If not warned, the Horror forms of its own volition and attacks, while the zombies only act at Bhar’s command. Once Bhar realises the danger, he flees and sacrifices the daemon to buy time.</p>\n<h4>Cold Storage</h4>\n<p>This grisly room, 20 ft by 20 ft, contains six slabs, each holding corpses preserved by the cold and Bhar’s magic for later experiments. Two enhanced zombies are also kept here awaiting orders. If Bhar has not sent them into battle, they remain here, motionless, until a Character enters the room. They use the same profile as @Actor[Qqb8P2q29vGNUMQt]{Bhar’s Enhanced Zombies}.</p>\n<h4>Where the Magic Happens</h4>\n<p>Bahr’s bedchamber is also his study, a room of 20 by 20 ft. Decorated in an Arabyan fashion, there is a large, opulent bed, a comfortable chair, a desk, and a large bookcase. The bed is covered in pink, blue, and black silks. A large array of skulls engraved with mystic sigils, some of them decidedly not human, adorn niches in the room’s walls. The hollow sockets all face the party. A sickly-sweet heavy scent lingers in the air.</p>\n<p>If not killed or captured, @Actor[Sy0829M1A3fxm57R]{Bhar} flees for his life through the secret door hidden behind the bookcase. While the Undercity side of the door requires a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test to find, from inside Bhar’s chamber it is <strong>Average (+20)</strong>. </p>\n<p>If he does escape, Characters on a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception </strong>Test hear footsteps fading away. If they wish, they can pursue the Magister into the Undercity, itself.</p>\n<p>Also here are Bhar’s records, abandoned in his flight. In addition to his spell book and forbidden works on Daemonology and Necromancy, there is a bundle of correspondence between Bhar and @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.b5sXx8PO9Jj8og2w]{Brunhilde Klaglich} in the same code as the message the pigeon brought.

The first is to try to retrace the trail of @Actor[juqHhVyUHAXN2zf2]{Snikkit’s} warband from the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.JAi2HLfYRkYwLC63]{Templar’s Arms}. This is a convoluted trail through the sewers and Upper Tunnels and requires a <strong>Very Hard (–30) Navigation </strong>or <strong>Challenging (+0) Track</strong> Test in order to determine which Hazards are encountered on the way to the post. The other way is to follow the tunnel down from the secret passage found behind @Actor[Sy0829M1A3fxm57R]{Vizier Bahr’s} bookcase. This is a much more direct route, requiring an <strong>Average (+20) Navigation</strong> Test in order to determine which Hazards are encountered on the way.</p>\n<p>The Staging Post is situated in a narrow, vertiginous cavern which drops several hundred feet, straight down. The cavern is lined with scrap-wood platforms, old ropes, and make-shift ladders. Several iron chains are attached to cranks and ratchets near the top of the cavern.  Iron cages are attached to each of these chains, around fifty feet below, which are used to hold their captives. The warband is always on the lookout for potential slaves and also careful to kidnap anyone who could give their existence away. </p>\n<p>The cages can be raised and lowered using the winches near the top of the cavern. They are usually raised to receive prisoners and then lowered to the bottom of the cavern to be released. The mechanisms are so old and rickety that they take a good few minutes to drop the full depth of the cavern.</p>\n<p>The vertical cavern links several underground routes and cave systems making it strategically important to the Skaven. There is only one main route into the top of the cavern, which is always guarded by a group of 6 Clan Mange @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{Clanrats}. Other ways in the Skaven are not bothered about, as they believe only they could know of them.</p>\n<p>There are a pair of prisoners currently in the cages, beggars who have been lifted from the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.NDbT1IWPeXXqHOlZ]{Altquartier} streets late at night. One, Delberdt, is suffering badly from @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.QiHMX5OyXBhWCYoF]{Ratte Fever}, delirious and fading fast. The other, Götz, is able to talk. If he is rescued, he can give an account of his abduction. Men with gap-toothed smiles coerced him and his friend to place sacks over their heads, and then led them along the streets to the Freiburg, then down some stairs where they were handed over to the ratmen, and dragged through the sewers and placed in cages. He says the ratmen mostly just squeaked to one another, but that when he had demanded to know what was happening to them, one had said they were ‘<em>going to the mountain’ </em>and that they would ‘<em>help kill the moon’</em>.</p>\n<p>Leading from this cavern, about halfway down, there is a side cavern that is barred by a makeshift door made from an old triangular jezzail shield and other scraps. Snikkit’s chamber is behind the door, which amounts to little more than a few furs strewn about the place and some mouldy cheese sitting on an incongruously finely crafted side-table. Snikkit uses this room for briefing his warband. On the smoothest part of the cavern wall is his latest effort. For the elucidation of his gang, Snikkit has drawn a charcoal street plan of the Wynd. One of the buildings has been marked with a large X, with the words FIZZY FIZZY next to it. Characters with knowledge of Middenheim, and a successful <strong>Difficult (–20) Navigation</strong> Test, might be able to work out that the map refers to Windhund Haulage.</p>\n<h4>Wrapping Up</h4>\n<p>Though not pleased if the Characters made a deal with @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{The Man}, @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} accepts it as necessary to a more important goal: crushing the Purple Hand and uncovering its plots.

The urgency of this will only be underscored when @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} informs them that the Convenor has recently vanished without trace. At a time like this that could hardly be a coincidence — could it?</p>\n<p>There are two natural places to start investigating: Gotthard’s home or the Komission. </p>\n<h3>Gotthard’s House</h3>\n<p>The Wallenstein residence in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.t1vYezDY0dOlA2yQ]{Brotkopfs} is in disarray. Gotthard rushed out in the middle of the night over a week ago, and the servants don’t know where he went. If Characters approach the front door, the party is greeted by Adolphus, a nervous butler who tries to put them off. If they mention their connection to the Watch, or pressure him another way, he reluctantly lets them in. The other servants stay out of their way, but if questioned, they can reveal that Gotthard was a cruel master who liked entertaining unpleasant guests from out of town. They explain that he returned from carousing in the early hours of the morning, went to his room and then stormed from the house in a rage. None know anything about Gotthard’s cult activity. </p>\n<h4>The bedchamber</h4>\n<p>Gotthard’s bedchamber is untouched since his disappearance — the servants are so scared of him that they dare not disturb its contents. It’s locked, but Adolphus can give them the key. The room is lavishly decorated, with a leather chaise longue and silk-hung four poster bed, the underside of the canopy decorated with a tasteless scene of cavorting figures. The wardrobe contains expensive courtier’s clothing and fine travel clothes, suggesting Gotthard did not intend to leave the city.</p>\n<p>A letter has been screwed up and tossed onto the writing desk. It’s addressed to ‘Gotthard von Wittgenstein. </p>\n<p>On the wall is a portrait of the Wittgensteins in less-mutated times. @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.ihG2gFIFF6Ai5Gik]{Ludwig} stands beside the imperious @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.ySbdLyidudlMwGhU]{Lady Ingrid}, along with three children, @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.CYQmOXaBgNR1PvD9]{Kurt}, @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard}and @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.fmUd7AtbJckbiWo6]{Margritte}. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/handouts/handout5-alt.webp\" width=\"444\" height=\"253\" /></div>\n<p>All appear untainted, but Margritte has a disturbing stare. Behind the portrait is a safe (Hard Lock –20). This contains Jade Sceptre robes, letters from Margritte (rather disturbing, but nothing new), and an amulet shaped as a symbol of Slaanesh. </p>\n<h3>The Convenor’s Office</h3>\n<p>At the Merchants’ Guild or Convenor’s Office at the Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation the party discovers that Gotthard has not been seen for a week. A clerk suggests they try his home. If Pendelwert replaced Gotthard, the party finds the blackmail letter on his desk. The clerk is worried and remembers the Convenor asking if he knew anyone called ‘Wittgenstein’.</p>\n<p>All appear untainted, but Margritte has a disturbing stare.

Entry is for members and their guests only. There are several private rooms where patrons can socialise away from the crowd, each named after an astronomical phenomenon. Gotthard (or Hans) came here in the early hours of the morning, met ‘Herr Gelb’ (an alias of the Yellow Fang cultist @Actor[wjDbXxeNT20qoiCd]{Karl Zeigenalter}), and failed to produce Dagmar’s research. After a brief struggle, the Convenor was taken through a concealed tunnel into the Undercity.</p>\n<p>Three people can provide clues on what happened that night. </p>\n<h3>Martina Graf — Proprietor</h3>\n<p>Martina is the imposing owner of the club. She is wary of sharing information about her patrons, but with persuasion she reveals the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gotthard was a regular patron. He was over-familiar with the servants and cabaret performers, and none liked him.</li>\n<li>‘Herr Gelb’ became a member a week before the Convenor disappeared. She knew ‘Gelb’ was an alias, assumed he worked for the Low Kings, and left it there.</li>\n<li>‘Gelb’ arrived at the club before midnight and went to the ‘Verdra Room’, where Heidi was serving. She didn’t see Gotthard (or Hans) arrive.</li>\n<li>She didn’t see Gotthard or ‘Gelb’ leave that night. She was busy with a big win on the gambling tables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Galzara — Bouncer</h3>\n<p>Galzara Voloshar worked the door on the night in question. She is a tall woman of Dolgan origin and perfectly capable of handling difficult patrons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‘Gelb’ arrived late in the evening. She didn’t know him, but he was a member, so she let him in.</li>\n<li>Gotthard arrived a few hours after midnight. He was furious; did not make his usual obscene proposition and demanded to see Gelb.</li>\n<li>She doesn’t remember either Gelb or Gotthard leaving, which she realises is odd, given she was on the door until the last patron left</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Heidi — Servant</h3>\n<p>The serving girl who attended the Verdra Room remembers that night well. She’s a precocious young Middenheimer from @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.06LuFlBESLckr28m]{Ostwald} who is happy to talk.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‘Herr Gelb’ was quiet when he arrived, quite twitchy. He’s nothing to do with the Low Kings — when you grow up in Ostwald you can recognise that kind of person. </li>\n<li>Gotthard arrived in a bad mood. She dreaded his visits, but he was preoccupied, and kept his hands to himself.</li>\n<li>‘Gelb’ and Gotthard didn’t seem to know each other. She served them two glasses of Pritzstock white wine and left them to it.</li>\n<li>She soon heard them arguing. Listening at the door, she caught a few snatches of conversation. Gotthard said, ‘he couldn’t care less what Dagmar was doing’. Gelb replied, my masters won’t take no for an answer’.</li>\n<li>About quarter of an hour later, Heidi returned to take another order. After knocking and receiving no answer, she opened the door. The room was empty. There was a smell of sewage and something like damp fur.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>WHAT ABOUT PENDELWERT?</em></h3>\n<p><em>If Hans came to @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.ZdbXOUNVLyP5W2pg]{The Heaven’s Lament}, it was his first time here. Martina knew of him as Convenor and was surprised to see him in a drinking establishment. Galzara says he was nervous and admitted him as a guest of Herr Gelb. Heidi felt sorry for him — he seemed out of place.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Verdra Room and Beneath</h3>\n<p>The small private room is oak-panelled with comfortable green upholstered chairs. It is named after Verdra, the green planet associated with abundance. The door is the only way in or out. If the party examines the room, they find the wall panels are solid. If they pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test they realise that one of the flagstones has been recently moved. When prised up (<strong>Hard (–10) Strength</strong> Test), they find a narrow tunnel leading underneath the building. Anyone with the Tunnel Rat Talent knows it was dug recently… with claws rather than spade or pick. The tunnel descends 10 yd to a sewer and the Undercity. @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard’s} (or Hans’s) story continues in @JournalEntry[eKyqk9CWnuaJgUFV]{Undercity Encounters}.</p>\n<h4>Harried Gotthard and the Cavern of Secrets</h4>\n<p>This section assumes @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.7b3n85kojlLKSpkT]{Gotthard von Wittgenstein} is the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.lKBVAnqIzL2Cvuos]{Convenor of the Komission for Commerce, Trade, and Taxation}, and he has been captured by the Skaven. If Gotthard is dead or fled, and Hans Pendelwert has been kidnapped instead.</p>\n<p>The torture chamber is a vaulted, stone, Dwarf construction whose original purpose is long-since forgotten. The Skaven torturers are cowardly even for Skaven, so as soon as they are disturbed they flee down through narrow escape routes. However, they try to summon reinforcements, so the longer the Characters stay here, the greater the chance of a Skaven counterattack (roll on the @Table[undercity-hazards]{Under-Empire column} of the Undercity Hazards table for every 15 minutes the Characters spend in the chamber). </p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FINDING THE TORTURE CHAMBER</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Torture Chamber is a location in the Upper Tunnels of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.v77YJsyHUxL3KNWz]{Middenheim’s Undercity}. Characters can access it by following a trail from beneath the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.ZdbXOUNVLyP5W2pg]{Heaven’s Lament}. If they follow the trail as soon as they discover it, they must pass a <strong>Difficult (–10) Navigation</strong> or <strong>Average (+20) Track</strong> Test in order to determine which Hazards are encountered on the way. If the Characters delay their expedition (in order to better prepare) this becomes a <strong>Very Hard (–30) Navigation</strong> or <strong>Difficult (–10) Track</strong> Test.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the middle of the room, Gotthard is attached to the roof and walls by rusting chains that force him to stand. The Skaven have not been kind to Gotthard, and depending on how slow the Characters were in reaching him he may have been partially consumed or, mercifully, dead. The torturers, in their haste to flee, left behind several pages of notes. These notes include a diagram created from their understanding of Dagmar Wittgenstein’s work, and their own odd scratchings on rat skin.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image\" style=\"justify-content:space-around\">\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/handouts/dagmar-map.webp\" width=\"394\" height=\"394\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[NqTNpdDIaLcLoFLB]{Dagmar Map}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/handouts/pelt-diagram1.webp\" width=\"306\" height=\"389\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[gzxKQZRxDfGrp4fh]{Pelt 1}</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Questioning Wallenstein</h4>\n<p>The Characters may have the chance to rescue @Actor[54rz079B0PFUaDWp]{Gotthard Wallenstein}. He is severely wounded from the torture he has endured, and half out of his mind with fear and pain. At first, he is unable to speak coherently, but if the Characters treat his wounds he is able to tell them what little he knows.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘They kept asking about stone. “What stone?” I asked. “From the castle,” they said. “What castle?” I asked. I would have told them anything if I only knew what they were after. I think they had me confused with someone else, but they wouldn’t listen when I tried to tell them that.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Gotthard realises that the Characters know that he is really a von Wittgenstein, and that they will not be put off with denials and protestations of innocence, Gotthard changes his tack.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘There was some Warpstone in the castle — I knew that. But I’m no wizard or alchemist. All that reading — no, thanks! I don’t even read my own contracts — no need if you’ve got a good staff. My sister Magritte, that’s the one you should talk to. She has all of old Dagmar’s books — knows all about that stuff. I almost sent them her way, just to make the torture stop.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the Characters have played <strong>Death on the Reik</strong>, they may decide to tell Gotthard that his sister and the rest of the Wittgensteins are all dead, and the castle destroyed by Skaven who found and removed the remaining Warpstone. A brief flicker of emotion crosses his face, especially if the Characters admit to having any role in the deaths of his family. Then, a thought clearly occurs to him.</p>\n<p><em>‘Wait… so I’m the last of the Wittgensteins?’</em> He takes a moment to consider this. <em>‘So, whatever’s left — not much, by the sound of it — but whatever’s left, it’s all mine?’</em> His expression brightens considerably.</p>\n<p><em>‘I tell you what,’</em> he says, turning to the Characters with a broad smile that he clearly believes is charming, ‘<em>you get me out of here — safely back to the city — and I’ll make it worth your while. I won’t even ask why you were down here in the first place. Two hundred Crowns apiece sound reasonable?’</em></p>\n<p>Gotthard expects the Characters to escort him to the surface — to his home, or to the headquarters of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.V7U6gDNDGGa2D1Ha]{Merchants’ Guild}. If they explain that they have other plans, his expression changes to one of petulant disappointment. He will stick with the Characters — at least until he finds someone else to lead him out of the Undercity, or until he is killed — but he will be something of a liability.</p>\n<p>Gotthard assumes that he is in command of the party, unless one of the Characters is a noble who clearly outranks him. Even so, he will question every decision, demand that every side-tunnel be investigated for a way to the surface, and grumble constantly. </p>\n<p>He is completely unused to the underground environment, making noise when it is most inconvenient, walking into almost every hazard before the Characters can avoid or neutralise it, and throwing loud tantrums every time his clumsiness gets him hurt. The Characters may be sorely tempted to kill him, or at least to abandon him in some dark passage.</p>\n<p>He does not have two hundred Crowns to give the Characters, promising that the money will be theirs ‘<em>as soon as I can access my estates, and collect some excise from the peons’. </em>He does all he can to collect his remaining riches and disappear to pastures new.</p>\n<h3>Rewards</h3>\n<p>Good roleplaying and clever thinking should be rewarded, but there are additional XP for the following:</p>\n<p>@Exp[20, Dealt with the Jade Sceptre ]{20 points for dealing with the Jade Sceptre }</p>\n<p>@Exp[15, Recovered artefacts from the torture chamber]{15 points for recovering artefacts from the torture chamber}</p>\n<p>@Exp[10–15, Uncovered the events of the night Gotthard disappeared]{10–15 points for uncovering the events of the night Gotthard disappeared}</p>\n<p>@Exp[10, Found the tunnel]{10 points for finding the tunnel}</p>\n<p>@Exp[5, Discovered the blackmail attempt]{5 points for discovering the blackmail attempt}</p>\n<p>If the Characters return from the Undercity with Gotthard or Pendelwert increase the Evidence Score by 2.</p>","folder":"mfdr9Fdj6RMvr7nM","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Missing Convenor","sort":0}}}

Tales of ratmen living under the city! Are you insane? Speak no more of it, or you’ll find yourself locked up, or worse. Let’s go before someone hears us.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Empire’s most remote villages and the glorious Reikland’s bustling cities, and in the long, dark corridors of power, spies lurk, shadowing Humans’ every move, just waiting to strike. Their assassins blackmail and murder officials across the Empire. Most atrocities occur without a trace. Entire villages disappear overnight. The Imperial armies have even fought them in open battle. Yet, the Empire’s majority deny the Skaven’s existence. One might ask how can such a wide-ranging threat escape notice — let alone survive, flourish and thrive — for so long? Those that speak out find themselves dead, or keep the knowledge of Skaven existence to themselves after witnessing the public humiliation and subsequent elimination of their outspoken peers. Denial and fear are lethal emotions, and combined provide the optimum conditions for the Skaven to move freely. </p>\n<h3>A Lifetime of Deceit</h3>\n<p>Skaven society, for want of a better term, is the epitome of ‘cutthroat’. Skaven have no concept of honour, ethics, or friendship: there are no alliances, only strategically delayed betrayals. Every Warlord is one misstep away from an underling stabbing him in the back and taking his place. Every underling knows that if <em>they </em>don’t do it, their peers <em>will</em>. The constant jostling for personal status and power is all-consuming.</p>\n<p>After nearly destroying themselves in civil war, the Horned Rat gave his children the Black Pillar of Commandments, 169 laws for Skaven society. But these laws are ludicrously complex and open-ended to the point where the only true law is ‘<em>Don’t get caught.’</em> Everything else is merely pretext. Surviving Skaven have become <em>experts </em>in clandestine murder, shifting blame, hiding or destroying evidence, and framing rivals to take the fall for it all. This expertise serves them well in hiding their plans from the surface world.</p>\n<h3>Those Who Know Too Much</h3>\n<p>A scholar may happen across lost records of Skaven activities, or a city guard may notice a pattern to certain thefts and unexplained deaths, which may lead down avenues of investigation the Skaven want left alone. Occasionally an operation goes wrong and the Skaven are forced to leave a target alive, or they leave a body behind in their haste. The Skaven watch the surface closely, searching for people who come too close to discovering the truth.</p>\n<p>Murder is usually the most practical and efficient solution to this problem. A peasant or burgher rarely has any security of note, and it is a trivial matter to infiltrate their home and kill them in their sleep. The nobility and other powerful individuals, with better security (and a great deal more paranoia about being murdered by rivals), may warrant a visit from @JournalEntry[XzJenEYTArBENmQA]{Clan Eshin’s} assassins, who can infiltrate almost any stronghold with ease.</p>\n<p>Skaven are cunning and wily, and ensure that most of the time they get others to do the killing for them. Suddenly the authorities receive an anonymous tip, conveniently find indisputable proof that someone who was about to go public about the Skaven was a heretic or other heinous criminal, and that person is swiftly put to death. Their records on Skaven are subsequently either burned as blasphemous ravings or soon stolen from libraries and evidence rooms, and people quickly forget all about it. The only thing that lingers is the memory of the discredited or feeble-minded deceased. (For more see @JournalEntry[Zk1cJmV9NRTkK6NC]{The Cover Up}.)</p>\n<p>Sometimes a target’s elimination would cause more problems than it solves. Killing particularly powerful nobles or well-known, established or even notorious persons who know too much could bring multiple investigations, each with a chance of discovering the truth. In such cases, the Skaven may still turn the situation to their advantage. The target might be coerced into silence, or the Skaven might use family or loved ones to ensure cooperation. The threats are invariably horrific; Skaven see all other races as slave labour, test subjects, or food, and their threats match their callous disregard for ‘lesser’ races.</p>\n<p>Blackmail is also incredibly effective. Many officials have dirty secrets that could ruin them, and the Skaven are experts at sniffing out and benefiting from such scandalous or prurient secrets. Anything from petty corruption to consorting with Daemons is used to silence a witness. A target might even be exposed to Warpstone to cause mutation, leaving the witness to be killed by an angry mob. Of course, the Skaven could offer to cure their target’s deformity, if they agree to do their bidding …</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A POORLY KEPT SECRET</em></h3>\n<p><em>There are parts of the Old World that do not have the luxury of pretending the Skaven don’t exist. In particular, Tilea has long suffered open attacks from the ratmen. As a result, the city-states spare little expense in defending against them. A famous mercenary company called the Rat Catchers, anti-Skaven veterans all, protects the city of Miragliano, personally financed by the prince. The Empire’s refusal to acknowledge the Skaven frustrates the southern nations. Taverna gossip on the subject ranges from the grim to the absurd:</em></p>\n<p>‘The Imperials, they pretend the ratmen are a myth because they are in league with them! Look how hairy they are, why they’re halfway to being Skaven themselves!’ </p>\n<p>‘The Empire is so lacking in manners and proper civilisation, I say it is no wonder the ratmen have infiltrated so deeply without their knowledge.’</p>\n<p>‘Skaven sorcerery, mi amico. They have cast a mighty spell of ignorance across the Empire to hide their presence! This is also why their men do not bathe and their wine is terrible!’</p>\n<p>‘They know, but they do not tell the people. Why? Look at them, they are gripped by panic already. If they were to admit there was yet another threat beneath their very feet, their society would collapse!

The Ruinous Powers wax strong, Greenskin hordes ravage the land, and the Empire’s old social order crumbles in the face of a rising middle class, feckless nobility, and destabilising cults. The latter are the greatest danger, with members often not realising they are in thrall to dark powers. The vilest cults are fully aware, and even work to speed the coming end. @JournalEntry[jOtzoEfZ7JaOW7uK]{The Yellow Fang} cult is among the most secretive and despicable of these. The cult has branches across the Old World, continuing to carry out Skaven deeds with abominable cruelty fuelled by intimidation and manipulation. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">‘I hate elves, and I make no secret of it. I’ll split an elf ’s skull as soon as I look at him. But what I saw in the Raki slave pens the day we wiped out their nest … It … Those evil … By Valaya, there are some fates you shouldn’t wish on any foe, and I’ll speak no more on it.’ </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Fenna Gromheld, Karak Ranger on cooperation with Elf Skaven hunters</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@JournalEntry[jOtzoEfZ7JaOW7uK]{Yellow Fang} members actively help to bring Skaven schemes to fruition in a similar cunning and clandestine manner, but not as cutthroat or conniving. They see Skaven supremacy as inevitable, and their hope is that when the ratmen finally topple the Empire, they will be allowed to rule the ruins. Better to survive with the fates the Skaven have promised than all others.</p>\n<p>The Skaven task the cult with many odious deeds, including  disposing of evidence, covering up thefts and murders, and providing scapegoats for what they can’t conceal. The Yellow Fang gnaw at the foundations of Human civilisation by spreading propaganda in public, cleverly couched as ‘acceptable’ prejudice — <em>‘All this panic over mythical talking rats is a distraction from the TRUE enemy of the Empire: those blasted Bretonians!’</em>. Emulating Skaven treachery, the cult is extremely careful to hide its involvement, operating from behind complex lies, outrageous rumours, and unknowing proxies continuing the clever ruse of obfuscation. The Skaven make excellent use of yet another layer of obscurity. They consider the cult a useful tool, when they consider it at all.</p>\n<p>All these tactics and more ensure that when evidence of the Skaven does surface, that proof rarely goes far. @JournalEntry[jOtzoEfZ7JaOW7uK]{Yellow Fang} members and blackmailed officials mock and discredit those who warn society. Any who persist soon wind up dead, after they have been stripped of their dignity and their reputation is left in tatters; their friends unwilling to investigate, lest they suffer a tragic ‘accident’. Disappeared relatives are presumed dead even as they toil under cruel Skaven lashes, never to see sunlight again.

{"_id":"iqCqAdzoFAJwsPsJ","name":"The Return of the Gravelord","content":"<p><strong>The Return of the Gravelord</strong> continues the adventures of the necromancer @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Hans Gräber}, which began in the <strong>Death on the Reik Companion</strong> with @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-journals.wIbYy6PUBKFdJvPF]{The Vengeance of the Gravelord} and continued in the <strong>Power Behind the Throne Companion</strong> in @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.u0jibG3CVNoLK6GT]{'Flying Death Skulls'}. In this instalment of this optional B-plot to <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>, Gräber pops up to annoy the Characters several more times and becomes convinced — quite wrongly —  that they have taken on a quest to defeat him.</p>\n<h3>THE STORY SO FAR</h3>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Hans Gräber} was a junior monk at a Sigmarite monastery near Dunkelberg, renowned for its scholarship into the history and legends of the First Emperor. It was in the monastery’s library that he first read of Heinrich Kemmler, the infamous Lichemaster. The young Hans burned to know more about the forbidden Lore of Necromancy and those who practised it.</p>\n<p>His studies eventually led him into the forbidden rooms of the monastery’s library, and after several warnings he was expelled. He swore revenge against @Compendium[wfrp4e-dotr.dotr-actors.bUxA8zyayMarTXP7]{Father Marcus}, the head of the monastery, and when the Characters first encountered him in ‘The Vengeance of the Gravelord’, he planned to exact it.</p>\n<p>Although he survived that encounter, fate decreed that he should cross paths with the Characters again, on the road to Middenheim at the start of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>. Gräber had another slight to avenge, this time against the population of the remote, vine-growing village of Pritzstock. His @Actor[FRS2PzhU3H98XfTX]{Flying Death Skulls} caused panic for a while, until the Characters defeated him and destroyed them. They may even have thought him dead — but as the many people who have claimed the head of Heinrich Kemmler can readily attest, one can never trust a necromancer to stay dead.</p>\n<p>Like the Characters, Gräber was on his way to Middenheim before he was distracted by his petty revenge on @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.O8KVZuY0yk5a5Lxa]{Pritzstock}. His original purpose was a darker one. Among the names he encountered in his studies were those of Dieter Helsnicht, the Doomlord of Middenheim; Melkhior the Ancient, the first Necrarch; and Zacharias the Everliving, who had studied under both of them. The forbidden tomes he consulted disagreed on whether these legendary necromancers had been destroyed, but every account agreed on one point: all had been active in the Forest of Shadows to the north of the Middle Mountains.</p>\n<p>@Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} set out for Middenheim, determined to learn more — and to make his way to this ancient hotbed of necromancy, find these legends if they still lived, and make an alliance with them. In his overheated imagination, such great necromancers could not fail to recognise him as an equal, and they would surely not refuse to share their secrets.</p>\n<p>As usual, @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} has overestimated both his own powers and the respect which he believes is his due. He has never been one to let reason or reality stand in the way of his glorious imaginings, though, and by this stage he is even willing to believe that the Characters are dogged archenemies who have devoted their lives to defeating him. Of course, their encounters with him take place completely by chance and they probably see them as an inconvenience rather than a sacred quest.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>FOR GROGNARDS: DIETER HELSNICHT</em></h3>\n<p><em>The name of Dieter Helsnicht will be familiar to <strong>Warhammer Fantasy Battles</strong> grognards from the Undead and Vampire Counts army books. A powerful Middenheimer wizard during the Age of Three Emperors, Dieter read the legends of Nagash and made the unholy pilgrimage to Nagashizzar. He returned to Middenheim a changed man, and it was only a matter of time before grim rumours led the authorities to his door.</em></p>\n<p><em>Helsnicht escaped on the back of a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.XtVkAVgZRIIgrBXb]{Manticore}, and it was widely thought he established a hidden fortress deep in the Forest of Shadows, where he conducted his foul research and trained junior necromancers as apprentices. He returned a few years </em></p>\n<p><em>later at the head of an Undead army, ravaging the north and striking terror into the populace until he was stopped at </em><em>the Battle of Beeckerhoven in 1244 IC. His @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.XtVkAVgZRIIgrBXb]{Manticore} mount fled the battlefield carrying his fallen body, which was never recovered.</em></p>\n<p><em>Helsnicht survived his wound, and would threaten Middenheim and the north many more times from his secret fortress deep in the Forest of Shadows, mounted on his @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.XtVkAVgZRIIgrBXb]{Manticore} and carrying a Chaos Runesword. He became one of the world’s most dread necromancers, and many deluded souls sought his tutelage.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">FOR GROGNARDS: MELKHIOR AND ZACHARIAS</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Grognard players of <strong>Warhammer Fantasy Battles</strong> will recall that Melkhior the Ancient is the first of the Necrarch line of Vampires. Created by Nagash’s student W’soran, ‘the Father of Vampires’, Melkhior learned all he could of necromancy at the court of Nagash before betraying and destroying W’soran and taking the great Book of Nagash from his former master’s library.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Melkhior fled north, establishing himself in a hidden fortress in the Forest of Shadows and devoting himself to dreams of a world where there are no living creatures, only the Undead. Many were drawn there by ambition and curiosity: the most promising of them became his apprentices, while the rest died slowly and painfully in his increasingly crazed experiments. Of all those who studied the necromantic arts with Melkhior, the most ambitious, the most powerful, and the most unscrupulous was Zacharias, whom some call the Everliving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Little is known of his life before he succumbed to the lure of necromancy. He studied under the tutelage of Dieter Helsnicht, and it was while under this great necromancer’s mentorship that Zacharias discovered the location of Melkhior’s hidden tower. Crossing the Forest of Shadows in secret, he planned to break into the tower and steal the dread Book of Nagash — the same accursed tome that Melkhior had stolen from his own master W’soran. Zacharias was caught before he could make off with his prize, but he had impressed Melkhior, who bestowed vampiric immortality upon him and made him his pupil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Melkhior taught his acolyte almost everything he knew, but never let Zacharias near his precious Book of Nagash. One night, as Melkhior was feasting on the blood of his unfortunate servants, Zacharias boldly crept into his master’s chamber, where the unholy Book of Nagash rested in a great lectern. Unfortunately for Zacharias, Melkhior returned unexpectedly, invigorated by the blood of his dead slaves and at the height of his strength.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Gravely wounded, Zacharias fled into the Middle Mountains. For a year, the minions of Melkhior searched for him without success. Creeping from one cave to another, weakened by his wounds and starving from lack of blood, Zacharias succumbed to a deathlike torpor that lasted for more than a decade. It ended only when a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.LZttdCIxmFr1sGsS]{Dragon} made a nest there, unaware of his presence. Awaking, Zacharias </span><span style=\"font-style:normal\">bit deep into the soft, exposed flesh of the Dragon’s underside, draining its life to fortify his own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Refreshed by this feast, Zacharias raised the Dragon from death, and flew on its back to Melkhior’s keep. The tower was all but destroyed, and what became of Melkhior, no one knows. Some say Zacharias drank his blood as he had drunk the blood of the Dragon, and gained his master’s powers by doing so. Others believe that Melkhior escaped and is in hiding, preparing his revenge. Since then, Zacharias has remained in the Forest of Shadows, shut in the restored tower and poring obsessively over the Book of Nagash.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>RUNNING THIS ADVENTURE</h3>\n<p>This adventure falls into five parts, which take place at various points during The Horned Rat.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[onAzmWqyt35DC8k1]{Part One: The Shadow of the Gravelord} takes place during the events of @JournalEntry[0Vz07cD1Twe2VB1Z]{Mysterious Thefts}, chapter 10 of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. As reports of various missing items are investigated, curious news reaches the Characters — the Library of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica} has been robbed for the second night in a row.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[YBPafHM4RHv3I44m]{Part Two: The Restless Dead} takes place during the next chapter as the Characters make their way to the @JournalEntry[56cL3qsLbEtoY81L]{Picket}. While they have yet to catch sight of the Gravelord, there is no doubt he is nearby.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[IV3IUZKE7N7kmRSR]{Part Three: Lindenheim to the Skin} takes place shortly thereafter as Gräber discovers the inhabitants of Lindenheim are not like other villagers. So, too, might the Characters.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[V1iOTAFhXWJMrdp3]{Part Four: Don’t Picket} takes place during @JournalEntry[56cL3qsLbEtoY81L]{The Picket}, chapter 18 of The Horned Rat. As the party approaches the Picket, Gräber realises they are nearby and convinces himself that they are going to the Picket to raise an army so they can hunt him through the mountains. His efforts to prevent this add to the Characters’ already complicated lives.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[MPy8SrTVRveJyXLe]{Part Five: Carrion Over the Mountains} takes place as <strong>The Horned Rat </strong>concludes. Knowing nothing of the battles at Brass Keep and Karak Skygg, Gräber assumes that @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Baron Heinrich’s} Dwarf balloon is scouring the Middle Mountains for him, and takes action to thwart his supposed pursuers.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>BUT HE’S DEAD!</em></h3>\n<p><em>By the end of @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.u0jibG3CVNoLK6GT]{Flying Death Skulls}, it is possible that the Characters may have captured or killed Gräber. If that is the case, never fear. He is both a necromancer and an archenemy, and either count is sufficient to justify his return. The conclusion of that scenario gives some suggestions as to how Gräber could get around the inconvenience of dying and be able to return for this adventure.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"xzib7Wt4bGWxCCv6","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Return of the Gravelord","sort":100000}}}
{"_id":"jOtzoEfZ7JaOW7uK","name":"The Yellow Fang","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/yellow-fang-cultist.webp\" /></div>\n<p>Many Humans hold dim views of the future. They believe that the Empire is failing and that the Old World itself is coming to an end. It seems that whatever Humans build or create crumbles into ruin and corruption: rulers care nothing for their subjects and family members betray each other for coin or a jug of cheap beer. Witch Hunters burn the innocent, crops fail, and prayers fall on deaf ears.</p>\n<p>Most keep such grim thoughts to themselves, and do their best to get through one more day. Others, though, are certain a new order is coming and have decided to throw in their lot with it. They want to be atop the pile when the Empire finally collapses. For such people, the Cult of the Yellow Fang and its worship of the Skaven offer a means of survival, and the promise of a place in the coming new order.</p>\n<h2>Origins of the Fang</h2>\n<p>It is not known when exactly the Yellow Fang was formed. It is possible that a rat-worshipping cult of some kind — not unheard of in the Empire and beyond — was somehow co-opted by an opportunistic Skaven. It is also possible that the creation of the cult was a Skaven plan from the very start, with Humans slowly inducted into an organisation entirely of inhuman making. In either case, the idea of using Human pawns came quite naturally to the Skaven. They consider themselves superior to every other species, and manipulating a few Humans into doing their bidding would therefore prove trivial. Over time this practice of bribery and intimidation of a few useful Human spies gave way to something much closer to outright indoctrination. The best part of all is that the cult is now self-sustaining. From time to time the Skaven step in to guide it in directions they find useful, but mainly the Yellow Fang has grown and maintained itself. </p>\n<p>The cult has branches across the Old World, wherever Humans live with Skaven beneath them. For the most part the cult has maintained its secrecy admirably. Even in Tilea, where Skaven existence is more commonly known, few could guess that their Human followers are not the occasional wayward soul or blackmailed sewer jack, but instead a fervently devoted sect of worshippers. </p>\n<p>The cult now eagerly awaits the day when its secret masters will rise up, throw down the corrupt Empire, and grant their favoured servants first pick of the spoils. This is almost certainly not going to happen, and indeed to most Skaven not used to dealing with Humans — which is the vast majority of the creatures — there is little difference between one Human and another, and surely all will be devoured when the great day comes and the Children of the Horned Rat rise up to take their rightful place atop the carnage of a ruined world.</p>\n<h3>Organisation</h3>\n<p>The Yellow Fang is a secretive and clandestine organisation, preferring to work from behind the scenes. Its members are skilled at manipulating others without revealing their own goals. Thus, when a plot is foiled, few recognise the hand of the true conspirators behind it. Even when the authorities make arrests, the false leads and double-blinds left by the cult keep its role unseen.</p>\n<p>Cells of the cult do not follow any particular pattern. The Yellow Fang is not a terribly discerning group when it comes to membership, save that those who can’t keep quiet find themselves quickly silenced, so anyone who is sufficiently disillusioned and convinced of the Old World’s impending collapse can find a place. The structure of the cult is very fluid, as individual leaders rise and fall through cunning, manipulation, violence, and alliances with any Skaven they encounter. In this way, the cult mirrors Skaven society, although the ratmen themselves tend to regard these Man-things as dupes to be used and discarded rather than as allies — especially since the concept of alliance is a hazy and highly mutable one in the Skaven mind.</p>\n<p>The cult is currently battling a schism. The traditional wing of the cult maintains its gloomy view that the surface world is doomed, and the surface-dwellers along with it, and the best that can be hoped for is some kind of survival under Skaven masters. The other faction, which arose fairly recently and is expanding rapidly from its base in Carroburg, maintains that the cult is destined to overthrow the Skaven and rule the surface world when the Empire inevitably crumbles. After all, did not Mandred prove Human superiority — and is betrayal not pleasing in the eyes of the Horned Rat? Until the new order has been established and it is time to seize power from the ratmen, though, they practise utter obeisance and lay their plans, just as all good Skaven do. In recent years this faction has been led by @Actor[NpymoZchG7iGVZsJ]{Mila Raast}.</p>\n<h3>Symbol</h3>\n<p>A stylised Skaven triangle with one of the lower points longer than the other and coloured a dirty yellow is the cult’s symbol. A curved dagger favoured by the cult is used for rituals and assassinations, its shape suggestive of a fang. Particularly devout members have a small yellow fang tattooed under their upper arm; while others go so far as to have an incisor knocked out, stained yellow, and hung from a string to wear around their necks. The missing tooth excites no comment in the Old World, where almost no one keeps a full set of teeth throughout adulthood.</p>\n<p>The truly devoted take things to an even greater degree, modifying their own bodies to look as ratlike as possible. Teeth are filed to points and ears are sewn to better resemble those of a rat. Some take on the affectations of Skaven speech and behaviour, repeating words and adopting twitching, jerking movements. The Skaven, of course, find this rather amusing, and further proof that theirs is the superior species — after all, why else would lesser creatures seek to emulate them? To some Yellow Fang members this is just so: they wish to look more like the creatures they worship. To others, especially among the faction that knows of and worships the Horned Rat directly, this is done not to emulate the Skaven, but in homage to their chosen god. A few of these fervent Yellow Fang extremists have even taken to wearing horns. While the average Skaven will think little of this, perhaps finding it mildly amusing, most Grey Seers would view it as a grievous insult. While a few Grey Seers do have dealings with the cult, none have yet to witness this brazen blasphemy directly — undoubtedly a blast of Warp lightning would end such an encounter rather quickly.</p>\n<h3>Methods</h3>\n<p>The Cult of the Yellow Fang can be surprisingly effective. It uses direct action to attack and undermine the existing order. It is particularly fond of public acts of sabotage that spread fear and dismay through the populace, such as the despoilment of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.jGfyLhox6OTD75oi]{Nordtor} wells in 2420 that resulted in an outbreak of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.txeLd7R13qxSvmsr]{galloping trots} that festered in the district for months. If they cannot find a convenient dupe to carry out an assassination, the Cult will send one of its own to complete the assignment — but they are careful to remove all cult tattoos and other identifying marks from the assassin’s body. Undertakings such as these are invariably suicide missions, so there must be no evidence leading back to the Yellow Fang.</p>\n<p>Typically the Yellow Fang are dispatched to either clear the way for a Skaven incursion, or to clean up after such an attack has gone badly. Beyond the more general goal of preparing human cities to fall, the Under-Empire is always on the lookout for areas where it might gain an advantage. Human engineering is watched carefully, for example designs and plans are often copied or adopted by Yellow Fang cultists inserted among the student body at Engineering colleges. The Skaven have learned much by closely observing human cultures as far afield as Cathay or Araby, and excel at putting this knowledge to use.</p>\n<p>When more direct action is called for, such as killing someone in the Empire who has learned too much of the Skaven’s existence, the Yellow Fang are sometimes used to lay the path or gather intelligence for a more skilled Skaven assassin — such as the one dispatched to kill @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Eunice Hasche} in <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. The Yellow Fang excel in this role, as their understanding of human culture means they are better equipped to predict a target’s movements, for example, attend a Middenball game next week or a play this weekend (sport and the theatre being two concepts with which most Skaven would struggle). </p>\n<p>The Yellow Fang are always on the lookout for opportunities to advance their position. This often takes the form of requesting greater authority or autonomy from their secret masters. The Skaven think this quite understandable, if undesirable, behaviour, but such is their view of Humans that even their most devoted servants are rarely trusted with any truly important task. Still, from time to time the Yellow Fang are given a task to which the Skaven would consider themselves better suited, such as a raid or assassination. In all such cases a Skaven team will be on standby in the sewers below, ready to rush in and set things right if the humans have failed in some way. Should the humans succeed, the Skaven credit the victory to their own watchful oversight of the bumbling cultists.</p>\n<h3>@JournalEntry[G9RPEQcICRM3zkKp]{Yellow Fang Cultists}</h3>\n<h2>THE HORNED RAT, GOD OF THE SKAVEN</h2>\n<p>The Humans of the Yellow Fang vary in their knowledge of the Skaven and their foul deity, the Horned Rat. Most know very little of this deity, or perhaps think of him as some kind of living overseer or leader of the Skaven. Some, however, have come by greater knowledge and give praise to the Horned Rat directly, granting his foul children due respect but not worshipping them outright. The Skaven themselves have not yet realised that this distinction exists, as they are prone to underestimating even those Humans who serve them.</p>\n<p>These cultists of the Horned Rat adhere to their faith a little differently from the Skaven themselves. Instead of worshipping the Horned Rat out of fear, like some stern parent, some cultists of the Yellow Fang dare to hope for his favour. By working actively to destroy the Old World’s civilisation, and thereby speeding the inevitable dawn of the new age, they hope to be rewarded with power and position — or at the very least, to be spared the slaughter that awaits the other surface-dwellers. Their conception of the Horned Rat is more rational, more compassionate than the dire god of the Skaven: in addition to withholding punishment, this Horned Rat might also reward those who please it.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/filler-skaven4.webp\" width=\"380\" height=\"112\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/yellow-fang-cultist.webp","folder":"rPvLMyaTjjDryUKZ","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Yellow Fang","sort":0}}}

He is a self-satisfied merchant who enjoys berating other grocers as too lazy to make something of themselves.</p>\n<p>Lachmann’s warehouse is in the northern streets of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt}, with a well-appointed storefront for customers. Above ground, there are cured meats and fresh produce in crates and hanging from the ceiling. In the extensive cellars Lachmann stores salted goods and even a small icehouse. </p>\n<p>Unknown to Lachmann, his cellars adjoin a stretch of the Skaven’s tunnels — where Fangleader Hisskar’s Stormvermin have trapped the Patchclaw Clanrats in a bottle-shaped chamber. The stench of death, decay and concentrated musk of fear emanates from several small fissures in the walls. It is so powerful that it permeates the entire warehouse and shop above.</p>\n<p>As the party enter Lachmann’s, they see celebrated chef Harrani Busuk storm out, followed by two worried kitchen boys, Kale and Dill. Lachmann is behind a counter, protesting that his lobster was fresh from the Nordland shore only two days ago. Anyone entering the warehouse is struck by the smell from below despite Lachmann’s attempts to cover it by burning aromatic herbs, which just makes it more nauseating.

The one on the west is older and somewhat cracked. The pungent smell is much stronger here. From the other side of the wall chittering, frantic scrabbling, and noise that can only be described as writhing can be heard. Occasionally there is a louder squeal of distress. The noise is unmistakably the sound of rats, but perhaps an octave deeper than usual. Lachmann notes that it’s never been this loud before.</p>\n<p>The party may want to break through the wall somehow, but Lachmann objects strongly should they suggest or try this.<em> ‘Are you insane?

He rents it out, but tenants never stick around. Krummer went travelling I think.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Krummer’s Place</h3>\n<p>Adjoining Lachmann’s warehouse is a townhouse owned by landlord Leo Krummer. He rented the place out to travelling merchants who wanted to base themselves in Middenheim, but few stayed long. </p>\n<p>The Skaven’s access tunnels run under the property and the ratmen realised that residents here might discover their presence. Leo Krummer was lured here by a Yellow Fang cultist posing as a ‘potential long-term tenant’. The Skaven then bricked him up in the walls to die. His desiccated corpse has gone undiscovered for 13 months. Now the property remains abandoned, the windows shuttered and door locked. The Yellow Fang keep an eye on it to ensure nobody breaks in.</p>\n<p>Getting into Krummer’s property is easy. The door has a <strong>Challenging </strong>lock. Inside is dark and eerie. A light source reveals wooden furniture covered in an inch of dust, burnt-out candles in pools of wax and wind whistling through a broken upstairs window. There are no footprints in the dust, suggesting that the property has been undisturbed for some time.</p>\n<p>The smell is strongest in the kitchen and the sound of agonised squeals comes from below the stone-flagged floor. There is a doorway which was once the larder, but is now bricked up. Anyone inspecting the brickwork realises it is relatively new, but hastily and crudely done. If the party breaks down the bricks <strong>(T6, 10 W)</strong>, Krummer’s corpse falls through. It is hideous: emaciated and dried out; it’s fingers scratched to stubs as he clearly tried to escape. His face is the most disturbing part — his mouth stretched wide in a permanent expression of terror. Test for @Fear[2]{Fear (Rating 2)}. </p>\n<p>On the wall of the larder, Krummer scratched a sentence in the last hours of his life.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/krummer-scratches.webp\" width=\"372\" height=\"330\" /></div>\n<p>In the corner of the kitchen is a wooden cabinet. The noise is loudest here, and if they destroy the wooden base, they’ll find an iron grill. Beneath is a 1-ft shaft opening into the stone chamber where the Patchclaws are trapped. The stench here is unbearable. Characters ought to pass a <strong>Hard (–10) Endurance</strong> Test or suffer –1 SL to all tests until they leave the area. </p>\n<p>If they shine a light through the shaft, they see a hideous sight. A mass of furred bodies are crushed together, writhing in agonised frenzy. Countless red eyes stare back at them from the dark. Sharp, yellow teeth gnash, bloodied spittle flying through the air. The ratmen are weak, but struggle in torment. Some tear at their own bodies, devouring their own flesh. Others set upon their kin, gnawing the flesh from their exposed heads and limbs. There are dead Skaven amongst the crush, flesh and gristle almost stripped to the bone. Those who survive have been sustained by the dead.</p>\n<p>This warrants a <strong>Hard (–20) Cool</strong> Test and 1 Corruption Point if failed. The party have several options.</p>\n<h3>Observe</h3>\n<p>If the party decides to watch the chamber, they’ll be spectators to a particularly unpleasant spectacle. The Clanrats are crushed together in their own filth. They cannibalise one another, throw themselves at the walls and scramble desperately at the barricades. Against one wall, a larger Skaven seems to be holding himself together, mostly by eating his weaker brethren. This is @Actor[gx1Nvw8AYjZdPPOi]{Clawleader Rikkhin} of Clan Mange.</p>\n<p>Beyond the barricades, they see large, black-furred Skaven in heavy armour, chittering in delight as the Patchclaws suffer. Occasionally Rikkhin tries to negotiate with an unseen Skaven beyond the barriers. The conversation is in Queekish, but a <strong>Challenging (+0) Intelligence</strong> Test suggests that @Actor[gx1Nvw8AYjZdPPOi]{Rikkhin} is both beseeching and berating another Skaven. If by some chance the party can understand Queekish, they learn that Rikkhin is trying to bargain with Fangleader Hisskar by promising him a fortune in warpstone, which Rikkhin believes he will soon receive from Karak Skygg.</p>\n<h3>Chats With Rats</h3>\n<p>If the party shine a light through the shaft and speak, they come to @Actor[gx1Nvw8AYjZdPPOi]{Clawleader Rikkhin’s} attention. He doesn’t care who they are — he knows he’s going to die — and will sell out the whole Skaven species to live another 24 hours. He speaks broken Reikspiel and offers to bargain with them if they come down and help. It’s possible to conduct a conversation and learn something of the Skaven plans, but only if he believes that they can help him out of his predicament.</p>\n<h4>Who are you?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Man-things! Servants of Horned One, yes? Here to help man-friend Rikkhin? I am Clawleader of Clan Mange. You are wise-mighty man-things.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What are you doing here?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Betrayed. Trapped by turntail Scrutens. They not like-like Mange work for great Master Warlock Maliss. We are loyal-trusted. Mange never traitor. The Horned One will gnaw the entrails of Scrutens.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What’s going on?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘The rage-hunger. The eat-kill. No food. Save Rikkhin. I help-help man-things. Gift with blessed stone. Tell all you want to know.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4> What are you doing in Middenheim?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘We follow orders of Maliss Manrack, great Warlock and Fabricator. Mighty among Clan Skryre. He order us to steal. Abduct weak-mewling man-things.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What are your orders?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Clan Mange soon-soon attack brass tower in mountains. Big attack. Man-things outside, plague-things within. Mange win.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What else can you tell us?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Warlock Master Maliss works a great scheme. Bring down great bounty from the Horned One. Rain of blessed stone. Clan Skyre pay great-great reward to Clan Mange. Plenty-much stone to me. Lay waste to all! Lay waste to all! But-but but leave you mighty man-things safe.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Enter the Chamber</h3>\n<p>If the Characters lever up the iron grill, they can drop down into the stone chamber one at a time. There is an 8-ft drop from to the ground but their fall is broken by Skaven corpses. On landing they are set upon by two frenzied Patchclaws.</p>\n<p>The stone chamber is a bottle-shaped room, blocked at both ends by a barricade of rubble and wood.  The Stormvermin of Clan Scrutens peer through spy holes and chitter in delight to see the fate of the Clan Mange Clanrats. If the Players enter the chamber, the Stormvermin leave to fetch their leader Hisskar.</p>\n<p>There are 15 living @Actor[Pm1UDikD8zXNrRPe]{Clanrats} in the chamber, including @Actor[gx1Nvw8AYjZdPPOi]{Clawleader Rikkhin}. While his pack fling themselves at the party, he backs away to save himself.</p>\n<p>If the party overcome a Clanrat, the others immediately set upon it and tear to pieces in a beserk hunger. If they kill more than five Clanrats, Rikkhin speaks with them as above — he sees an opportunity to escape.</p>\n<p>While talking, the other Clanrats continue to attack the party. If they kill the remaining Patchclaws, the Stormvermin from the barricades attack. These are tougher opposition. Three enter from each end of the chamber. Use the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.kl4qHg0mqWOApBqH]{Stormvermin} profile. These trained Skaven have a simple objective, to kill every human who witnessed their existence. Hisskar stays out of harm’s way and flees — if the party beats his Stormvermin.</p>\n<h3>Kill from a Distance</h3>\n<p>If the Characters decide to eliminate the Patchclaws from the shaft (for example, dropping incendiaries or explosives, or using magic) then the wretched ratmen die pretty easily with blood-curdling squeals. The Stormvermin withdraw, disappointed that their entertainment is over. If the party is overzealous, they may damage the foundations of Krummer’s property and Lachmann’s.</p>\n<h3>Tell Someone</h3>\n<p>The party may want to summon help or use this as the perfect opportunity to prove the existence of the Skaven.</p>\n<p><strong>Lachmann</strong>: The merchant is horrified and asks them to deal with it. He doesn’t quite believe them, but will pay an extra 10 GCs to the party, if they can make the problem go away without alerting the authorities. </p>\n<p><strong>The Ratters’ Guild</strong>: If the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.I86oiOppQimWvWaP]{Ratters’ Guild} is consulted their response depends on who is manning reception. There is a 50% chance that either Hauke Ayinger (assuming he hasn’t been unmasked) or Isaak Köstritzer is on duty during opening hours. Köstritzer is aware of the Skaven, but knows better than to advertise the fact. He is wary and encourages the party to keep it to themselves. <em>‘Sounds like the sort of thing that got Old Magda killed last month. Best wait it out to see what happens…’</em> Ayinger scoffs at the notion but, with feigned reluctance, agrees to note down as much information about the trapped Skaven as he can. Half an hour later he heads off to meet with a Sewer Jack captain (@Actor[uL6CLyF3u6QpRDQ9]{Raina Müs} if she lives). He explains the situation. The Sewer Jack then descends into the Undercity and informs a Clan Scrutens scout that the starving Skaven have been discovered. Clan Scrutens quickly kill any remaining members of the Patchclaws and clean the cavern of any remains.</p>\n<p><strong>The Authorities</strong>: Most officials dismiss the stories as fanciful nonsense. @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} is concerned, and encourages them to find more proof of the Skaven to make their case stronger. He suggests they ensure the starving Skaven all are dead.</p>\n<p>If they leave the scene, use ‘Other incidents’ below to move the situation on while they are away.</p>\n<h3>Help the Skaven</h3>\n<p>It’s possible the party decides to help @Actor[gx1Nvw8AYjZdPPOi]{Rikkhin} and the Patchclaws in some way. The @Actor[Pm1UDikD8zXNrRPe]{Clanrats} are too far gone to resist attacking them, but Rikkhin suggests they storm one of the barricades with him. If this works, the Clawleader and any remaining Clanrats flee, and never see the party again. Clan Mange ‘loyalty’ does not extend to man-things.</p>\n<h3>Other Incidents</h3>\n<p>If the party leaves the scene, events unfold without them.</p>\n<p>A Clanrat becomes so insanely hungry and desperate to escape that it leaps up the shaft and squeezes through the bars, a sickly cracking echoing in the tight space as it snaps its own bones to do so. If a Character returns to Krummer’s house, it springs at the first Character to enter the kitchen, ruined bones grating in a pain it entirely ignores. Use the @Actor[Pm1UDikD8zXNrRPe]{Starved Clanrat} profile and the element of surprise. </p>\n<p>The Yellow Fang are watching the property and saw the Characters enter. When they later investigate, the cultists don’t know what to do. There are masters dying while other masters look on and watch. If the party returns, four Yellow Fang cultists ambush them, and throw anyone they defeat down the shaft for the Patchclaws to eat.</p>\n<p>If more than half a day passes, the situation comes to a head. The remaining Patchclaws become so insanely famished that they lose all sense and storm the barricades. It’s a massacre, and @Actor[gx1Nvw8AYjZdPPOi]{Rikkhin} is killed in moments. The Clan Scrutens Stormvermin clear the chamber to remove evidence of Skaven presence.</p>\n<h4>Rewards</h4>\n<p>Good roleplaying and clever thinking should be rewarded, but there are additional XP for the following: </p>\n<p>@Exp[20, Eliminated the Skaven in and around the chamber]{20–40 points for eliminating the Skaven in and around the chamber}</p>\n<p>@Exp[20, Talked with Rikkhin]{20 points for talking with Rikkhin}</p>\n<p>@Exp[15, Discovered the chamber beneath Krummer's property]{15 points for discovering the chamber beneath Krummer’s property}</p>\n<p>@Exp[10, Dealt with Lachmann successfully]{10 points for dealing with Lachmann successfully}</p>\n<p>If Skaven bodies are removed from the chamber and exhibited in Middenheim increase the Evidence Score by two.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-skaven-shield2.webp\" width=\"283\" height=\"270\" /></div>","folder":"iXB5QNNSLed8fMke","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Black Hunger","sort":0}}}
{"_id":"klTaRQ8ujZG1mQwH","name":"Skaven Denial","content":"<p>In the years following the Black Plague of 1111 IC, the Skaven roved openly throughout the Empire, but at Middenheim they were thrown back, and ever since they have been exceedingly cautious in how they approach this nation. Whilst the Skaven are hidden and secretive in general, they go to enormous lengths to keep the people of the Empire in a state of ignorance.</p>\n<p>Their campaigns of misinformation, cover-up, and even mind-bending sorcerous ritual have been so successful that it has become something of a tradition, even an artefact of national identity, for folks in the Empire to doubt the very existence of Skaven. Openly discussing ‘Rat-Headed Beastmen’ is a good way to ruin the buzz in a tavern, or cause an awkward silence to descend upon a high-class dinner party. Agitators pushing for recognition of the fact that an Under-Empire exists beneath their feet can find themselves charged with causing pernicious mischief.</p>\n<p>The denial comes in many forms. A hard-line fringe insists that there is no such thing as Skaven, and that phenomena that might prove their existence can be put down to freak mutation or sorcerous illusion. Such people can be surprisingly creative and vociferous when faced with evidence that conflicts with their beliefs.</p>\n<p>More common is an acceptance that mutants with ratlike features do crop up, and may even band together in underground lairs, but that they do not form a coherent species with a populous society — let alone that they have mastered arcane sorcery and technology.</p>\n<p>There are sections of Imperial society that do not deny the Skaven. Dwarfs have suffered greatly from their depredations, and find themselves caught between feeling frustrated at the ignorance of Manlings and feeling embarrassed to admit to how badly they have fared in their struggles. Scholars of History and Bestiaria know there is more to the Skaven than occasional freaks in the sewers. Mercenaries and adventurers also swap stories of having faced bands of Skaven on their expeditions.</p>\n<p>During <strong>The Horned Rat</strong> the characters will have a number of opportunities to expose the Skaven to increasing scrutiny, and the degree to which they do so has an effect on the preparedness of the Skaven at a number of junctures in this adventure. The more evidence of Skaven activity the Characters produce, the more effort the Skaven have to expend on covering their tracks and avoiding repercussions, and the more inhibited their schemes become.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the Characters fail to prevent operations carried out by the Skaven and the Yellow Fang then things become more difficult for them, and Skaven operations benefit from an increasing head start.</p>\n<p>At the end of many sections of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, alongside experience awards, a modifier is given to a running total of Evidence. If the Characters do efficient work of exposing Skaven activity and foiling their schemes this number grows higher, but if they miss vital evidence or let the Skaven get away with their schemes it diminishes. The GM should keep track of this score, but keep it and its implications secret from the players.</p>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:346px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:28px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.6415%;height:28px\" colspan=\"2\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">EVIDENCE SCORE TABLE</h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.6415%;height:34px\"><strong>Evidence Score</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:85.3585%;height:34px\"><strong>Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:106px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.6415%;height:106px\">3 or more</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.3585%;height:106px\">\n<p><strong>Undeniable</strong>. The Characters are doing a fine job of exposing evidence of the existence and activities of Skaven. More people in the region maintain vigilance and act against the Skaven on their own initiative.</p>\n<p>Later parts of the adventure make note of how the performance of Skaven is negatively impacted by the efforts of the Characters.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:89px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.6415%;height:89px\">-2 to 2</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.3585%;height:89px\">\n<p><strong>Plausible Denial</strong>. The Characters are causing a bit of a stir due to their efforts, but by and large people remain ignorant of the Skaven.</p>\n<p>There is no major effect from this result, but keep the score in mind as it will modify certain tests, such as convincing Middenheim’s rulers to accept the Characters’ findings.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:89px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.6415%;height:89px\">-3 or less</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.3585%;height:89px\">\n<p><strong>Deeper Denial</strong>. The Characters’ bungling is playing into the hands of the Skaven and even lending apparent credence to those who suggest the Skaven are a myth.</p>\n<p>Later parts of the adventure make note of how the Skaven benefit from the poor performance of the Characters.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>MIDDENHEIMERS AND THEIR OPINIONS OF SKAVEN</h3>\n<p>By the time they commence <strong>The Horned Rat</strong> the Characters may well know many people in and around Middenheim, and they may try to sound out their opinion on the Skaven. See the table below for their baseline attitudes.</p>\n<p>NPCs marked with an * are people who have the ear of the Graf. (<strong>Note</strong>: He is rather more open to well-formed arguments than he was in <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>.) For each that is brought to a state of Full Acceptance, the Evidence Score increases by 1 point. On the other hand, if they are reduced to a state of Overwhelming Denial, it decreases the Evidence Score by 1 point. Other NPCs have no effect on the Evidence Score, but are given as examples of how folk in Middenheim think. NPCs brought to a state of Full Acceptance may also do what they can to help the Characters expose the Skaven, whilst those in a state of Overwhelming Denial may well try to complicate matters for them.</p>\n<p>In order to move an NPC from one level of acceptance to another, a Character must do one of two things: give a coherent and sincere account of their experience with Skaven and pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm Test</strong>, or produce physical evidence of Skaven existence or activity — for example, show a Skaven corpse or skeleton, or a Skaven in captivity. Skaven footprints and other evidence (bits of fur, claws, whiskers and teeth marks) do not have the same impact. </p>\n<p>So @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.1UPIDtrSuQv4zUVg]{Dieter Schmeidehammer} (Bare Acceptance) could be brought to a state of Full Acceptance (and therefore contribute to a positive Evidence Score) if the Characters showed him a single Skaven corpse and told him of one encounter. @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.f9GN3PQGUp9tjSCT]{Breugal} (Overwhelming Denial) would need to see five separate corpses and/or be convinced of five accounts in order to reach the same level.</p>\n<p>If the Charm Test is failed by 3 SL or more, the Characters might actually contribute to denial, and if the evidence they produce turns out to be faked, the person they are hoping to convince will become even more of a denier. For example, the Characters may take Dieter Schmeidehammer to see @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Eunice} Hasche dissect a Skaven corpse (@JournalEntry[Zk1cJmV9NRTkK6NC]{The Cover Up}), but if her subject turns out to be a hoax, Dieter moves from a state of Bare Acceptance to Bare Denial.</p>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:170px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td

Skaven rarely fight without seeking additional reinforcements. </p>\n<p><strong>Alarm Call</strong></p>\n<p>Unless they are surprised, Skaven encountered in the Lower Tunnels or the Under-Empire give warning shrieks to alert nearby patrols of the threat.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting Help</strong></p>\n<p>Skaven are not proud fighters. If a fight is going badly for them (for example, if half of a Skaven patrol has been killed without inflicting casualties on the other side), they scamper away and try to summon assistance.</p>\n<p>In order to see what occurs as a result of a call for reinforcements, consult the table below whenever an alarm is called, or Skaven leave to seek help. The number in brackets is the number of turns it takes for help to arrive. Generally speaking, weaker forces will respond sooner to alarms, and stronger forces respond eventually as a result of getting help.</p>\n<p>Calls for reinforcements can become an avalanche. When reinforcements arrive the first thing they do is call for more reinforcements, and if they fare badly in a fight they also run off to summon more help. Only so many reinforcements can be summoned in a particular area before they are exhausted. </p>\n<p>@Table[skaven-reinforcements]{Skaven Reinforcements Table}</p>\n<p>In the Lower Tunnels only 1 alarm call and 1 get help can be made per hazard. In the Under-Empire 5 alarm calls and 10 attempts to get help can be made per hazard.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Astrid, Gottri and Benni encounter a Skavenslave Gang, who raise an alarm. The GM rolls a 6, indicating that a further Skavenslave gang arrives in 20 Rounds. After some of the first Skavenslave gang are slain they run off to get help. The GM rolls a 10, indicating that a Clanrat Patrol will arrive in 10 Rounds.</em></p>\n<p><em>Because this encounter takes place in the Lower Tunnels only 1 alarm call and 1 get help can be applied. The Characters face two groups of Skavenslaves and a Clanrat patrol before the hazard is finally negotiated. If they persist in exploring the Lower Tunnels, and encounter another Skavenslave Gang, the process begins anew.</em></p>\n<h3>In Pursuit Of Skaven</h3>\n<p>The Skaven move easily and comfortably in the Undercity. They are able to leap chasms in a single bound that the Characters might hesitate to risk, they can squeeze through gaps that the Characters are not able to get through, scamper past patches of mould without triggering them, and do not care in the least about becoming besmirched. Obstacles may be used to mount an ambush on Characters who draw close in their pursuit.</p>\n<p>Any pursuit of Skaven quickly confirms that they are in their element. GMs should notice that entering the Under-Empire is deliberately punishing. The point of this adventure is not to pursue Skaven in the Undercity, but to find and stop @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack}. Reckless Characters may be doomed to end their days in a corner of the Under-Empire in a fog of poison-wind with venomous blades stuck in their backs, which could bring a sudden halt to the campaign. </p>\n<p>If circumstances are such that the party is overwhelmed by Skaven, the GM can offer them the chance to spend a number of Fate Points equal to the members of the party. In this instance a fortuitous event occurs that sees the Characters spared death, but that also leaves them far from the Under-Empire. An example might be discovering a vertical shaft left by a spring now run dry, that leads back to the surface (but which caves in after the last Character has scaled it). Or the party could be captured and enslaved, stripped of their gear, put to work in part of the Undercity, and rescued by Dwarfs or Sewer Jacks.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>ENTERING THE UNDER-EMPIRE</em></h3>\n<p><em>Should the Characters find their way to the Under-Empire, be sure to impress upon them what they have uncovered. The stench is overwhelming, a lethal mix of urine and animal musk that stings the eyes and constricts the throat. There is a constant background hiss of thousands of clawed feet on stone and packed earth. Every wall is lined with warrens and hiding places. Glinting unblinking eyes watch every move. The tunnels grow wider with each step forward and eventually open out to huge caverns packed with Skaven and their prisoners. The caverns are lit with the ominous glow of Warpstone lamps, and filled with shrill squeals of torment. Towering structures stretch from floor to ceiling, lined with machines of unknowable purpose that crackle with green lightning. The Under-Empire is the work of a civilisation so divorced from the understanding of those who live above as to be almost unfathomable. It is the impressive result of a species-wide effort to build a home for itself beneath the feet of the ignorant surface dwellers. The only fates possible for those who find themselves here are immediate escape, merciful death, or tormented enslavement.</em></p>\n<p><em>This description serves a single purpose — get the Characters to run screaming back into the light of Middenheim, leaving any thoughts of confronting the Under-Empire behind them. They should come away with the realisation burned into their minds that they can no more defeat the Skaven beneath the city than they can invade Bretonnia. More subtle means must be found.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"Dl2LHPFH2e0EVlZ0","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Undercity Encounters","sort":400000}}}

They are typically led by a forceful individual and fight hard if engaged, but they are not dedicated to the point of suicide.

{"_id":"lU8JzeJmeTknebl2","name":"The Apprentice","content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/dirty-rat.webp\" width=\"178\" height=\"153\" /></div>\n<p>@JournalEntry[XzJenEYTArBENmQA]{Clan Eshin} is known throughout Skavendom for its excellence in the art of assassination and subterfuge. There are a number of ranks of death-dealing agents within the clan, from the lowest Night Runners to the Warp-grinder, all of which are feared by other Skaven. Of those trained in the art of stealth killing, Night Runners are the lowest-ranking and least experienced. Viewed as expendable fodder by their masters, they often serve as scouts on exposed flanks, the bait for ambushes, or are thrown against superior foes to provide a useful delay or distraction. Those that manage to survive, proving their cunning and resourcefulness, are looked at in a slightly better light. While some Night Runners are marked as potential leaders, those with a true knack for stealth and killing become Gutter Runners.</p>\n<h2>GUTTER RUNNERS</h2>\n<p>These Skaven work in teams, assassinating Clan Eshin’s targets, leading surface dwellers and rival Skaven factions alike into conflict with each other, and generally sowing discord and utter fear wherever they go. Among the Skaven it is supposed that every accidental death and associated misfortune can be blamed on the work of Clan Eshin’s Gutter Runners. There is never any evidence of this, but it is often true all the same.</p>\n<p>Some among the Gutter Runners further exceed their master’s expectations. These few are taken aside and given further instruction in the deadly secret arts of Clan Eshin. A handful are apprenticed to true Clan Eshin Assassins, there to better learn the art of blade, poison and shadow — should they survive the harrowing apprenticeship in the first place.</p>\n<h3>Becoming Prey</h3>\n<p>Gutter Runner Dricht Skuttlespite is one such apprentice. He was told to stand back and watch as his much more experienced master, Fleer Twitchkill, set upon some hapless surface dwellers in the Man-thing city of Middenheim. As fate would have it, the Characters have seen off Twitchkill, leaving his apprentice Skuttlespite in a rather awkward position.</p>\n<h2>DRICHT SKUTTLESPITE</h2>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/dricht-skuttlespite.webp\" width=\"305\" height=\"286\" /></div>\n<p>The life of an apprentice assassin is a harrowing one. Kindness is not a trait enjoyed by any Skaven, but Clan Eshin’s Assassins  are cruel even by the measure of their kin. Many die during their training, more than a few at the hand of their master. @Actor[A91mGI6tqksBf25n]{Dricht Skuttlespite} is Master Assassin @Actor[hEeKB7frieZ7ru74]{Fleer Twitchkill’s} last remaining apprentice. There was no love lost between the two; nevertheless, he will eventually come after the Characters.</p>\n<p>The Gutter Runner has no interest in ‘revenge’ per se; if anything, the Characters did him a favour by eliminating his master. However, @Actor[A91mGI6tqksBf25n]{Dricht} considers Twitchkill’s Shadow Cloak to be his by rights and will do nearly anything to get it. @Item[62ygcYULNNU70r4J]{The Shadow Cloak} is made from greasy human hair, tattered cobwebs, and strands of Ulgu. It is not a matter of want, but rather need. By outliving his master, Dricht has attracted the attention of his clan’s higher-ups. It is quite likely that Lord Sneek, Clan Eshin’s leader and a Lord of Decay, will turn his beady eye towards Dricht.</p>\n<p>All Eshin Assassins are elevated to that position by performing a task set by Lord Sneek himself. This is inevitably an incredibly difficult mission of some kind — the assassination of a high-ranking Skaven or Empire official, for example — and it must be completed to a very strict timetable. If Dricht wishes to complete this task and live, he must have every advantage he can get his skilled and stealthy paws on. Recovering his master’s enchanted Shadow Cloak would be an excellent start to securing his own long-term survival.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>ASSASSINATION ASSUMPTIONS</em></h3>\n<p><em>During the events of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong> the Characters are almost certain to gain the unwelcome attention of Master Assassin @Actor[hEeKB7frieZ7ru74]{Fleer Twitchkill}, a Clan Eshin Assassin possessed of, or perhaps by, an enchanted Cloak of Shadows, and with a desire to kill most creatures he happens across. The assassin has been sent to silence the enemies of the Skaven in Middenheim — especially those who have stumbled across evidence of Skaven activity, or otherwise may reveal the Skaven to the wider world. </em></p>\n<p><em>It is presumed that the Characters will have to kill Twitchkill or themselves fall beneath his poisoned blades. While it is possible that the Characters avoided him in some way instead, such relief can only be temporary — he will search for them across Middenland if he must. He is impossible to bargain with, and ceaseless in his pursuit.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Shiny-Shiny</h3>\n<p>Much like his master, Skuttlespite doesn’t think much of other species, but he knows that most of them seem to be obsessed with gold. The Gutter Runner will study the Characters from a distance for a time, before setting up his <em>‘clever-cunning’</em> ambush: a pile of <em>‘shiny-shiny’ </em>gold placed in a discreet location, like on a box at the end of an alley, or on a stump in a shadowy clearing. Skuttlespite reckons that the fools won’t be able to resist such a lure. It consists of only a couple of actual gold crowns, with the bulk of it being pyrite. </p>\n<p>Once the Characters go for his bait, he’ll try to shoot one or more targets with a bolt coated with Foolmaker (see his stats), then demand answers to his questions from the shadows (he speaks passable Reikspiel). He will find it impossible to believe that all the Characters willingly gave up the Shadow Cloak, but anything that indicates their superiors have it (<em>‘Ah, yes-yes, taken by your Clawleader’</em>) will see him sharply questioning them on where it would be stored. </p>\n<p>Once @Actor[A91mGI6tqksBf25n]{Skuttlespite} secures the cloak or, to his horror, discovers that it was destroyed, he’ll withdraw to return at a time of his choosing so as to silence the Characters forever, as they now know far too much about the Skaven for Clan Eshin’s comfort.</p>\n<h3>Using Skuttlespite</h3>\n<p>When and where to deploy the apprentice is something that must be handled with care. He will not attack the Characters too soon after they defeat his master. A sense of cautious restraint, not to mention fear, will prevent him from acting immediately. Instead he will watch the Characters carefully, if less expertly than @Actor[hEeKB7frieZ7ru74]{Twitchkill} had done. The Characters’ sense of relief at having killed the assassin will soon fade as they realise they are being closely watched from the darkness again.</p>\n<p>Equally, @Actor[A91mGI6tqksBf25n]{Dricht} cannot wait too long before striking. Word will get out that Twitchkill is dead, if it hasn’t already, and he will be summoned before Lord Sneek and assigned his trial. Therefore, he cannot dawdle and will have to make his move against the Characters, even if they fail to fall into one of his clever traps.</p>\n<h4>Before Leaving Middenheim</h4>\n<p>Middenheim’s streets provide ample cover and opportunities for @Actor[A91mGI6tqksBf25n]{Skuttlespite} to strike. He is unlikely to attack during the day, but if the Characters are out and about at night he will attack them if he can. Areas like @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{the Wynd} would be best — winding narrow streets with many abandoned buildings and a lack of patrols will provide the would-be assassin with many opportunities. He may find that his display of ‘gold’ is snapped up before he has time to get into position, however. The Characters may well come across piles of pyrite inexplicably left in their path, a nearby street urchin vanishing into an alley, gold crown in hand, unable to believe their luck.</p>\n<h4>On the Road to the Picket</h4>\n<p>The road is long and Middenland isolated, giving @Actor[A91mGI6tqksBf25n]{Skuttlespite} plenty of opportunities to attack the Characters. He may leave some bait on the road ahead of them, or wait until night to attack them while some are asleep. He will avoid attacking them in an inn, however, as the noise will undoubtedly bring unwanted attention.</p>\n<h4>At the Picket</h4>\n<p>@Actor[A91mGI6tqksBf25n]{Skuttlespite} cares little for the Yellow Fang, and is completely, perhaps wilfully, unaware of their activities at the Picket. The presence of so many armed soldiers does give him pause, however, and unless the Characters are very careless about their own personal safety he will avoid attacking them while they are at the Picket.</p>\n<h4>On the Way to Karak Skygg</h4>\n<p>This is @Actor[A91mGI6tqksBf25n]{Skuttlespite’s} last chance to get the Characters, as by now a summons will surely have reached him from Lord Sneek. He will have to attack the Characters somewhere in the mountains, risking even his own life to extract answers about the cloak from them.</p>\n<h4>Flipping the Script</h4>\n<p>If the Characters are having too difficult a time with his master, it may well be wise to deploy @Actor[A91mGI6tqksBf25n]{Dricht} in a different role entirely. Instead of ‘avenging’ his master post-mortem to retrieve the coveted cloak, have Dricht approach the Characters earlier and offer to help ambush Fleer Twitchkill and kill the troublesome assassin. This is entirely keeping with the trecherous nature of Skaven, and does not at all preclude Dricht returning to attack the Characters later on. After all, better to tie up any loose ends before they become a nuisance.</p>\n<h3>Too much of a good thing</h3>\n<p>If the Characters do away with Skuttlespite, avoid the temptation to send yet another assassin against them. At least for now. Having one stealthy assassin followed by another is quite enough, and if you simply send another apprentice after them you will be trying the Players’ patience. Worse still, you may distract them from the main plot! </p>\n<p>By defeating a Clan Eshin Assassin and his apprentice Gutter Runner, the Characters have signalled to the denizens of the Under-Empire that these particular surface dwellers are resistant to Clan Eshin’s usual tactics. While the assassins themselves would never admit as much, the price of any contract on the Characters’ lives will shoot up as the supply of assassins willing to take them falls dramatically.

{"_id":"lVB8iBc0iaIzWS4u","name":"Empire on the Brink of Turmoil","content":"<p>War is coming to the Empire; everyone can feel it. Whilst the subject of the violent period of turmoil into which the nation is soon to descend is the focus of the next part of the <strong>Enemy Within</strong> campaign, <strong>Empire in Ruins</strong>, it should be clear throughout <strong>The Horned Rat</strong> that outbreaks of fighting are occurring in various quarters and that troops are being recruited, trained, and despatched to the front. In particular, the following flashpoints are the subject of gossip on every street corner and barroom in Middenheim. </p>\n<p><strong>The Reikland</strong>: The Emperor’s decision to relieve the von Jungfreud family of their right to rule Ubersreik has spread panic. Revolts have occurred in the city, and state troops from Altdorf are being sent there in increasing number. Nobles swell their retinues with regiments of hastily recruited ‘mean men’ in fear that they may be treated like the Jungfreuds. These hastily formed private armies are undisciplined, and their habit is to raid neighbouring estates. Bögenhafen is also a site of unrest, either due to Daemonic incursion or mysterious deaths of wealthy citizens, depending on the actions of the Characters there. </p>\n<p><strong>Nordland</strong>: Nordland’s independence from Middenheim is being sought with increasing ferocity. Rumours of corruption and incompetence amongst Middenheim’s rulers help to fuel the case for secession. A nobleman named Gausser seeks the overthrow of the Nikses who he claims are puppets of the Graf.</p>\n<p><strong>Averland</strong>: Averlanders are becoming increasingly frustrated with the rule of Iron Countess von Alptraum. Responding to complaints about recent food shortages, she is quoted as saying, <em>‘Why are people so obstinate as to insist on bread when it is so scarce?’</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ostland and Talabecland</strong>: Claims that Crown Prince Hergard von Tasseninck of Ostland was slain due to the machinations of the von Krieglitz family of Talabecland refuse to go away, and the two provinces seemed destined to make war on one another.</p>\n<h2>MIDDENHEIM IN RECOVERY</h2>\n<p>Whether or not the Characters played through <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong>, the events described there have certainly occurred. @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Karl-Heinz Wasmeier}, one of the city’s three Law Lords, sought to usurp power by compromising and corrupting several of the most influential people in the city. Whilst disaster was averted Middenheim is reeling from the effects of his schemes.</p>\n<p>Graf @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.RTu5HVkESXJFlF7f]{Boris Todbringer} still mourns the death of Anika-Elise Nikse, though he realises now that his dark moods contribute to Middenheim’s vulnerability, and is slowly becoming a more actively involved ruler.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.XY9dT0a5Tin6KKAs]{‘Princess’ Katarina} has grown confident and curious. She takes a more active part in politics, supporting her father’s recovery, and taking an interest in the findings of the Characters.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.spofHAzgwmx7bdQL]{Chancellor Sparsam} retains his position, despite suffering from a previous addiction to stimulants. He is deeply ashamed of the part he played in Wasmeier’s schemes, and is keen to make amends. He devotes himself to his work, but is inhibited by mood swings resulting from his withdrawal.</p>\n<p>Deputy High Wizard @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhauer} prepares to journey to Altdorf on a diplomatic and fact-finding mission. </p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.VqvKKvGm7y1XzDUe]{Ar-Ulric} has stepped back from public life. During the adventure he spends time preparing his successor for the role before departing on a solitary quest for spiritual atonement that will take him to the far north. His secret lover, Lady-at-Court @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.puFBI6fLMjn68Ab2]{Emmanuelle Schlagen}, decides that she wishes to return to the acting life, and soon relocates to Altdorf.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.36cfXI6iq58zebUl]{Dieter Schmeidehammer} prepares to retire as Graf ’s Champion. Though if Dieter was never diagnosed as having been hypnotised, and treated accordingly, he still occasionally voices rather surprising opinions about taxation.</p>\n<p>Law Lord Hofflich is dead. Law Lord @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.lYEKyCpaihHON6Gz]{Wasmeier} is missing, presumed dead. Law Lord @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.SpheWCQbn1PuhUdL]{Erlich} is in a state of profound shock and cannot carry out his duties. For now the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.npvkLprEILbQafzs]{Worshipful Guild of Legalists} steps in to maintain legislative processes in Middenheim, and new Law Lords are selected from their number in time.</p>\n<p>Middenheim’s citizens are largely kept in the dark about the reason for the sudden spate of resignations and disappearances amongst Middenheim’s leadership. A number of lurid conspiracy theories are quickly invented and circulated to explain things. Many of them point the finger at the perfect scapegoats — Sigmarites.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/empire-soldiers.webp\" /></div>","folder":"eA89rusrishKp5h8","sort":650000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Introduction","sort":650000}}}

While this claim may be exaggerated, it is certainly true that the monstrous population of the Middle Mountains rivals even the denizens of the fearful Drakwald.</p>\n<p>In addition to beasts of Chaos and the occasional small band of Greenskins, many kinds of monstrous beasts make their lairs among the peaks, feeding on each other and the occasional foolish traveller, and are largely untroubled except for the occasional Human noble on a trophy-hunting expedition.</p>\n<p>The mountains are home to all manner of dangerous creatures, made hungrier and more aggressive by the barren environment and severe weather conditions.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-undead-rat.webp\" width=\"435\" height=\"167\" /></div>\n<h3>Common Creatures</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.KtYgLHcSLpHmnGI2]{Bears} hunt and scavenge in the remote mountains, preying on mountain goats and upland flocks in the summer, and hibernating in caves through the winter. In spring half of all encounters with bears will be with a mother and two or three cubs: the mother will react with extreme violence to any approach or perceived threat.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.VPVnyae6VHeD9cEP]{Giant Spiders} of all sizes make their lairs in small caves and rock piles, venturing out to hunt. One particular species, the @Actor[BuMyyn0LTNj1JtCR]{Cliff Spider} is highly specialised in this environment.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.AAiKqD1IoweDpJI7]{Snakes} of all sizes can be found in the mountains, especially in the warm summer months when they can be found sunning themselves on the sun-warmed rocks. The Rock Serpent is particularly dangerous, with its deadly ambush technique.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.lSvYEInG8sZ03vqd]{Wolves} are as common in the mountains as in every other wild place. They tend to be smaller than their more prosperous forest-dwelling relatives, but are no less aggressive. Many are intelligent enough to use the remote terrain to their advantage, driving prey into caves or blind canyons.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.z8f3vySKIpTxGr62]{Basilisks} are exceedingly rare, but may be encountered in the remotest parts of the mountains, especially places that have been strongly and recently affected by Chaos — like the area within the @JournalEntry[56cL3qsLbEtoY81L]{Picket}, for example.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.VMceSpLje0J7lfP0]{Cave Squigs} are unknown in the Middle Mountains, where their Goblinoid masters have failed to establish a lasting presence. However, in other mountain areas, such as the southern Worlds Edge, they are a constant threat.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.LZttdCIxmFr1sGsS]{Dragons} are also unknown in the Middle Mountains, although there is always the chance that one of these great and powerful beasts may have arrived recently and settled into a large and comfortable cave. However, if that’s the case the creature’s hunting can scarcely have escaped the notice of local farmers and herders, and adventurers may already be in the area searching for its lair.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.HZfZaCjdniz5Z4CP]{Giants} are unlikely to be encountered in the Middle Mountains, unless one has decided, for unknown reasons, to join the Warriors of Chaos in Brass Keep. Rare at the best of times, Giants are far more likely to be encountered in the deeper mountains of the Worlds Edge, where monsters of all kinds are more common.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.8g9rnHLiZ1pJcPPt]{Griffons} and @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.RiXpMLex8SZf6gaQ]{Hippogryphs} are comparatively rare in the Middle Mountains, although efforts have been made to set up wild breeding programmes there. Bailiffs and huntsmen working for the local Electors have established a number of hunting preserves, stocking them with goats and other prey, and artificially improving potential nest sites in the hope that the creatures will breed. Every elector would love to have a Griffon as a mount, or to form a body of Hippogryph knights. Both species are notoriously reluctant to breed in captivity.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Yee9gwxJUceGbnO2]{Pegasi} are more common in the Grey Mountains, which boast a wider expanse of upland pasture than many other ranges. It is also said — mainly by Bretonnians — that the creatures are attracted to their more chivalrous nation.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.KeB0khEeq462qTJw]{Wyverns} are rare but not unknown in the Middle Mountains, and more common in the wilder and more lawless ranges to the east and south.

With a little cunning and a head for heights, they can be employed in a similar manner to the Middenheim Chair Lifts.</p>\n<p><strong>The Gate of Grungni —</strong> Skaven are surging through the main entrance and the party can join them. If they are willing to race through the Hold, past burning Skaven, through collapsing tunnels and down to the Entrance Hall, they will need to fight through [[/br d10 # Clanrats]] @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{Clanrats} to get out.</p>\n<p><strong>The Outflow —</strong> by the time the party reaches the Pit at the bottom of the Hold, the slaves have escaped. This is the safest way out of Karak Skygg.</p>\n<h2>END IN SIGHT</h2>\n<p>With the destruction of the Moonbreaker Cannon, @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss} dead and Karak Skygg ablaze, the Characters are stranded in the Middle Mountains in the dark of the night, with bands of terrified Skaven fleeing the area. It’s also freezing cold. Depending on how the events of the previous chapter played out, the Characters are looking up at a clear night sky illuminated by the grimacing orb of Morrslieb, or possibly looking up at a sky filled with fireballs as warpstone meteorites rain down on Middenland. </p>\n<p>But soon a pinprick of light from the east grows bigger, intermittently flaring, before appearing closer as something rather miraculous — a dirigible — bearing the Todbringers’ livery.</p>\n<h2>NEED A LIFT?</h2>\n<p>Seeing the adventurers trapped on the mountainside, likely waving for help, Baron @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich Todbringer} drops an anchor down from his dirigible, bellowing down to the party, ‘<em>Who are you! What has happened here?’</em> If you have played through the events of <strong>The Power Behind the Throne</strong>, the Characters may have learnt that Heinrich has travelled to Wolfenburg to play diplomat and peacemaker in Talabecland and Ostland.

The light from the blasts of hot air reflects off Veiran’s armour and, and reveals his decorations as a member of the Knights Panther.</p>\n<p>Heinrich asks about the huge explosion they’ve just seen. If the Characters satisfy the initial questions (take a <strong>Challenging (+0) Charm</strong> Test for the Character doing most of the talking, reduced to <strong>Average (+20) </strong> if the Characters provide plausible or compelling answers), the dirigible descends to the mountain so that the discussion can continue — @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.0Z49f8xUPns5OkTA]{Heinrich} will not leave people to die in the mountains. However, Heinrich is suspicious of everyone, especially given his knowledge of human cultists who work for the Skaven.

She then sent the ransom note (via an innocent hired messenger), which gave Orteli three days to raise 500 gold crowns or his son would be killed. Further, the note told Orteli to wait for instructions on how to hand over the money.</p>\n<p>Claudia is now waiting for the deadline to expire, at which point she will send a message to Orteli telling him to go to a certain bar in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt} with the payment. There Paolo will take the money from him and return to the house.</p>\n<p>If Orteli doesn’t come up with the money, Claudia plans to send along a token of Sigismund’s (say, a finger or toe) in the belief this will encourage Orteli’s cooperation. If Paolo comes back with the money, Claudia will kill Sigismund (there’s no sense in leaving witnesses, after all), then the gang will disperse. After going to ground for a few weeks, Claudia and Paolo plan to target another less tight-fisted victim.</p>\n<p>As you may have gathered, @Actor[comd8h9fa4Kl0D4P]{Claudia} is not a very nice person. Fortunately for Sigismund, Claudia hasn’t taken into account the brilliant — nay, astonishing — @Actor[qvHgWQ8HF3rn003M]{Alphonse Hercules de Gascoigne}, who performed the almost impossible task of tracing the paper used for the ransom note back to a vendor in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.2w06sbgxCxV745oJ]{Altmarkt}. The stall’s proprietor, eager to cooperate with the funny-looking figure who was waving money around, gave Alphonse an accurate description of the ‘shifty-looking number with the big, mean dog’ who bought the paper. For a detective of Alphonse’s talents, tracing Claudia to her hideout was child’s play.</p>\n<p>Though she doesn’t suspect that anyone knows where she is, @Actor[comd8h9fa4Kl0D4P]{Claudia} is taking no chances. The victim is bound hand and foot and locked in the basement. @Actor[comd8h9fa4Kl0D4P]{Claudia}, @Actor[IZtbzNLfSa27EWPw]{Paolo}, and @Actor[Qi0tp86o0gJnohzN]{Giuseppe} are stationed in the living room at all times; a guard is on duty in the hall, and another is in the kitchen.

The aim of the game is to get one’s dagger as close as possible to your own foot, with whoever gets theirs the closest winning that round. Mumblety-peg is usually played to the first to win three rounds, though by long tradition anyone who hits their own foot is declared the winner by default. The player with the worst throws must pull the peg or knife out of the ground using only their teeth, likely mumbling curses at the others.</em></p>\n<p><em>What one can draw from this is that cold nights on the Fauschlag are indeed long, and that there is often precious little to do by way of entertainment.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Surveillance</h3>\n<p>The following is a timetable of the events that transpire at number 17 during the Characters’ watch.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: NPCs are listed by name, but as the Characters have no way of initially knowing the villains’ names, consider describing them by their physical descriptions: ‘the brown-haired man’, ‘the tall, scared woman’, and so on.</p>\n<h4>Start (noon)</h4>\n<p>Bedrooms 2 and 3 are empty, and remain that way.

She makes one more trip outside, this time accompanied by a @Actor[Qi0tp86o0gJnohzN]{big, mean-looking dog}.</p>\n<p>The dog, also on personal business, sniffs around the garden and the surrounding area, paying special interest to the undergrowth and other places any spying Characters may be holed up. Anyone hidden in the tenement or tenement’s privy is safe from discovery; others are sniffed out if they don’t think fast by throwing the dog some food or similar. If @Actor[Qi0tp86o0gJnohzN]{Giuseppe} discovers a Character while @Actor[BG2mxjsYI1L0OvaL]{Britta} is away, they can attempt a <strong>Hard (–20) Charm Animal</strong> Test to encourage the Manhound to leave them alone.</p>\n<h4>11:30 pm</h4>\n<p>@Actor[u6aqv6Tplpoh81Mg]{Ilona} enters the kitchen, and she and @Actor[BG2mxjsYI1L0OvaL]{Britta} go to wake up @Actor[itzmGGCtBLD9vWeC]{Knud} and @Actor[GaDt44ecicgBLDea]{Mikhail}. The two pairs switch places: @Actor[u6aqv6Tplpoh81Mg]{Ilona} and @Actor[BG2mxjsYI1L0OvaL]{Britta} go to bed, @Actor[itzmGGCtBLD9vWeC]{Knud} takes up watch in the kitchen, and @Actor[GaDt44ecicgBLDea]{Mikhail} goes to an unknown post on the ground floor (the hall).</p>\n<h4>12:00–8:00 am</h4>\n<p>Bedroom 1 is quiet and dark. A bored @Actor[itzmGGCtBLD9vWeC]{Knud} sits staring out the kitchen window. @Actor[GaDt44ecicgBLDea]{Mikhail} pops in from time to time, refilling three mugs at a small barrel of rainwater, and poking Knud when he starts to doze.</p>\n<h4>8:00 am onwards</h4>\n<p>The dog is let outside again while @Actor[itzmGGCtBLD9vWeC]{Knud} and @Actor[GaDt44ecicgBLDea]{Mikhail} have a bit of breakfast. The guards change shifts at 11:00; then everything proceeds as yesterday.</p>\n<h3>Enter Alphonse (Once Again)</h3>\n<p>@Actor[qvHgWQ8HF3rn003M]{Alphonse} returns to Number 17 at midnight that evening.

Several zings present zemselves, do zey not? What do you zink, mes amis?‘</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now is the time for the Characters to prove to @Actor[qvHgWQ8HF3rn003M]{Alphonse} that his faith in them was not in vain. Alphonse coaxes, goads, and orders them to give their interpretation of the intelligence they have gathered, and asks for suggestions on how to rescue Sigismund.</p>\n<p>Of course, the world’s greatest detective has already deduced everything that can be gained from the evidence the Characters collected, but wants to hear their views anyway so he can show them how clever he is by criticising their plans.</p>\n<h3>Alphonse’s Conclusions</h3>\n<p>Alphonse has made a number of brilliant deductions about the situation, and is only too pleased to share them in as theatrical a manner as he possibly can.</p>\n<h4>Sigismund’s Location</h4>\n<p>The lad isn’t being held in the attic — there are no guards there — and if he was, the villains would have fixed the skylight. Obvious, of course! Sightings indicate that he isn’t in any of the bedrooms. It’s possible he could be locked in a wardrobe, but if so, one guard would be ordered to stay awake at all times in case he got out or started a ruckus. By extension, he probably isn’t on the first floor either.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if still alive, Sigismund is somewhere on the ground floor or in the basement. Since the kidnappers ‘live’ on the ground floor, it’s more likely that he is imprisoned in the cellar.</p>\n<h4>Number of Villains</h4>\n<p>Six: two upstairs, one in the kitchen, plus three more somewhere else on the ground floor (@Actor[u6aqv6Tplpoh81Mg]{Ilona’s} three tankards — don’t the Characters remember such important details?).</p>\n<h4>Lines of Attack</h4>\n<p>@Actor[qvHgWQ8HF3rn003M]{Alphonse} has figured out a number of ways the Characters might pull off a rescue. Again, he lets them make their own suggestions before chiming in with his genius. Though impressed, perhaps justifiably, by his own intellect, Alphonse does know a good plan when he hears one. He defers to the Characters in matters of violence as he concedes they are likely more experienced with it than he, and will be the ones responsible for carrying out the agreed-upon plan in any case.</p>\n<h4>Poisoning the Food</h4>\n<p>Something unpleasant could be introduced into the villains’ grub at the inn. There are several potential drawbacks: the poison might be noticed, Sigismund could be affected, or the villains forewarned of the Characters’ arrival.</p>\n<h4>Frontal Assault </h4>\n<p>Alternatively, @Actor[u6aqv6Tplpoh81Mg]{Ilona} could be ambushed during her foraging trip to the pub, and someone else disguised as her could walk up to the front door. Chances are that the ‘password’ is simply her name (just like the backdoor).</p>\n<p>When the door opens, the other Characters, hidden nearby, could rush in and overpower the guards. Of course, the plan would fail if they use a different password, or if the kidnappers notice it is not Ilona before opening the door. Also, the impostor would have to hold the door alone until the other Characters, likely hidden some way away, arrive.</p>\n<h4>Rear Assault</h4>\n<p>A guard could be tackled in the outhouse and replaced by a suitable party member. The drawbacks here are that the guard in the kitchen might hear the scuffle, and the Characters must act quickly so as to not arouse suspicion.</p>\n<h4>Skylight Entry</h4>\n<p>Apparently the least-defended entrance, which may mean it is trapped. The skylight is also a long way from Sigismund’s most likely location, and would involve a dangerous and possibly noisy trip across the rooftops.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-device.webp\" width=\"234\" height=\"260\" /></div>\n<h3>Planning The Rescue</h3>\n<p>Now the Characters must decide on a plan of action. They should take stock of their resources to see what might be of help in rescuing Sigismund. Using @Actor[qvHgWQ8HF3rn003M]{Alphonse}, you could remind the players of Skills and Talents they might have forgotten. Don’t make their plan for them, but feel free to point out any obvious oversights or mistakes they are making.</p>\n<p>You may be surprised at the brilliant plan the Players concoct. In normal circumstances, combat comes upon Characters suddenly — often somebody opens a door they shouldn’t and combat begins that very instant. While this is often exciting, this type of encounter provides little time for the Characters to think, as they must react to the situation they find themselves in. Give the Players half an hour to exercise their clever imaginations and the resulting plan may surprise you.</p>\n<p>Whatever plan the Players decide upon, play it straight. It is quite conceivable they dream up something so devious they will pull off the rescue without a fight. If so, let them. You shouldn’t feel constrained to have a climactic melee at the end of the scenario if the situation doesn’t warrant it.</p>\n<p>If their plan has a lot of holes, the Characters are in for a hard time. If Claudia’s gang discovers the Characters early, Sigismund’s life and Alphonse’s reputation are done for.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>PERCEPTION TESTS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Each time the Characters make a noticeable noise (tripping over something, falling down the ladder, etc.) make an <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test for the Guards upstairs if they are awake, or a Challenging (+0) Test if they are asleep. You need only make one Test for both of the Guards. Particularly loud noises, especially combat, are instead <strong>Easy (+40)</strong> if the guards are awake or <strong>Average (+20)</strong> if they are asleep. These are not Opposed Tests — no amount of stealth can quieten the sounds of combat.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Exit Alphonse</h3>\n<p>After the Characters come up with a plan, it’s time for Alphonse to disappear. The detective is not a terrible fighter, but this is exactly the sort of thing he pays other people to take care of. If the Characters are short someone to play a key role in an otherwise sound plan, he may remain. If you are worried they may be able to stumble into combat and find themselves hopelessly outmatched, you may want him to stick around. In either case, do not allow his presence to diminish the Characters’ sense of achievement by having him do too much — this should be their moment of glory (or ruin).</p>\n<p>However, if you have decided to have Alphonse taking a back seat during the assault but the Characters insist on having him participate, there are other ways to have him support the assault without stealing the limelight. For example, as the Characters and Alphonse are crouched outside number 17, ready to attack Britta when she goes to the loo, a Watch patrol marches on to the street and begins pounding on doors, obviously conducting a search. Alphonse tells the Characters that he’ll distract them for as long as he can, hopefully giving the Characters time to finish the assault.</p>\n<p>If things get out of hand later and the Characters are in deep trouble, Alphonse can always show up at the last minute to bail them out. However, if the Characters have truly failed spectacularly, and especially if their plan was terrible, feel free to allow them to fail. Stories are much more compelling when success is not assured. </p>\n<h3>The Rescue</h3>\n<p>The actual break-in is as easy or difficult as the Characters make it for themselves. @Actor[comd8h9fa4Kl0D4P]{Claudia’s} objective in the event of trouble is to unlock the door to the basement, grab Sigismund (which takes 3 rounds) and get back upstairs (taking 2 rounds), while @Actor[IZtbzNLfSa27EWPw]{Paolo} and @Actor[Qi0tp86o0gJnohzN]{Giuseppe} buy her time. Paolo fires his Blunderbuss and then charges; Giuseppe runs straight in, biting away. Once Claudia is upstairs with Sigismund, she’ll threaten the boy’s life unless the Characters let her leave.</p>\n<p>When all the swordplay and yelling starts, the guards attempt to rally to @Actor[comd8h9fa4Kl0D4P]{Claudia}, but if they’re badly outmatched they do their best to flee. They are only being paid so much, after all.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-pouch.webp\" width=\"270\" height=\"193\" /></div>\n<h3>Number 17 Wendenbahn</h3>\n<h4>Attic</h4>\n<p>The guards in bedroom 1 can make Perception Tests to notice entry from the attic. If they are awake, these are <strong>Challenging (+0) Tests</strong> opposed by the Characters’ Stealth. If they are asleep, the Characters’ Stealth Test becomes <strong>Easy(+40) </strong>instead.</p>\n<p>Unless oiled, the skylight squeaks when opened. The drop from the skylight to the floor is 3 yards (the guards can make another Perception Test unless the Characters use a rope to avoid the fall). The place contains lots of damp old furniture, plates, and rugs that can trip Characters up. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test is required to avoid kicking over something loud unless they bring a light source or have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.x0WMGwuQzReXcQrs]{Night Vision} Talent. The trapdoor to the first floor is also squeaky and the ladder has a broken step. Unless they think to check the ladder before descending, the first Character down must make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test to see the broken step or otherwise make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics</strong> Test or fall, allowing the guards to make another Perception Test.</p>\n<h4>First Floor</h4>\n<p>The gang is only using bedroom 1 and typically has two guards inside, sleeping or playing cards (see <strong>The Surveillance </strong>above for a timeline of shifts). If alerted, the guards take 1 round to grab their weapons. If they are asleep, it takes them 3 rounds and they won’t have time to don armour.</p>\n<h4>Ground Floor</h4>\n<p>Combat here results in Perception Tests as above. Both the hall and kitchen have a guard (armoured and with a weapon at hand). The living room contains Claudia, Paolo, and the dog. The pair sleep in turns, with Paolo having the day shift. Whoever is asleep takes 2 rounds to wake up, 1 round to get weapons, and will not have time to don armour. The dog wakes and attacks in 1 round.</p>\n<h3>The Resolution</h3>\n<p>There are two possible endings to this encounter: either the Characters capture or kill Claudia before she gets to Sigismund or @Actor[comd8h9fa4Kl0D4P]{Claudia} gets a knife to his throat and delivers a very sincere ‘<em>Back off or the kid gets it.</em>’</p>\n<p>The latter results in a traditional standoff: @Actor[comd8h9fa4Kl0D4P]{Claudia} can’t escape, and the Characters can’t get to Sigismund. A tense bargaining session ensues as Claudia and the Characters attempt to come to terms. Claudia offers to hand over Sigismund for money and safe passage (20 crowns will do it), though if pressed, the leader will accept just the safe passage.</p>\n<p>However, the Characters must convince Claudia that they will let her pass safely. This is a real test of the Characters’ ingenuity, and a possible solution is for one of their number to volunteer to take Sigismund’s place. This is exceedingly dangerous, but Claudia would gain little benefit from killing the Character (there’s no money in it), and the last thing she needs right now is more enemies. If a Character does something this heroic, reward them by sparing their life — Claudia drags them a couple of blocks, and then knocks them on the head and leaves.</p>\n<p>Obviously, if Sigismund is killed or the kidnappers take him somewhere else, the Characters have failed. Sigismund’s father will be distraught, and while there may be some talk of revenge against the Characters in the heat of the moment, they are merely the words of a grieving father and nothing more comes of it. Of course, @Actor[qvHgWQ8HF3rn003M]{Alphonse} may not wish to associate with them again unless the failure was genuinely down to misfortune rather than recklessness.</p>\n<h4>Spin-offs From the Scenario</h4>\n<p>If you wish, there are several directions you could take after the adventure’s conclusion.</p>\n<h4>A Family Affair</h4>\n<p>Claudia is a minor member of a small Tilean criminal group, Masnada, with operations throughout the Empire. She planned this kidnapping operation on her own as a way to make up a loan owed to the family back in Miragliano. Unfortunately, her failure has left a stain on Claudia’s family honour, and a debt unpaid to boot. Claudia’s siblings, a trio of particularly dangerous bandits who cut their teeth raiding caravans returning from the Border Princes, are sure to seek their revenge on the Characters.</p>\n<h4>The Big Cheese</h4>\n<p>Claudia has no particular affiliation with any of Middenheim’s Low Kings, the crime lords that rule the city’s underworld. However, attempting such a kidnapping without their approval would obviously have been a terrible idea. @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.pB1MDVRBRyJTptne]{Edam Gouda} was promised 20 percent of the takings, some 100 gold crowns, for his permission to proceed with the kidnapping. The Characters’ interference has left Gouda out of pocket, and The Big Cheese will be quite unhappy with them until paid. He doesn’t expect the full hundred crowns — the Characters were just doing business, after all — but he expects a cut of whatever they were paid. </p>\n<p>An agent of the Low King will arrive looking for payment the night after the kidnapping is foiled. How the Characters proceed is up to them. Should they pay, @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.pB1MDVRBRyJTptne]{Edam} is as good as his word, but may even attempt to hire the Characters in the future. If they refuse, the following night a gang of thugs will call to remind them why it might be easier just to pay up.</p>\n<p>If the Characters rescue Sigismund, his prosperous (but mean) father will be delighted. They receive many dinner invitations where they can mingle with the good and the great of Middenheim — should they not already have contacts in that group. In this way, the adventure may also work well before the events of <strong>Power Behind the Throne</strong> take place, as it gives the Characters access to powerful NPCs who might not otherwise give them the time of day.</p>\n<p>If the Characters made a mess of things and got Sigismund killed — and lived to tell the tale — there’s always the chance that either Sigismund’s family or any survivors of the gang will come looking for them. Perhaps @Actor[comd8h9fa4Kl0D4P]{Claudia} (if she lives) fingers them as co-conspirators, or even the masterminds of the entire affair! It’s the sort of trick that she would appeal to her, especially if it might get her out of a tight spot.</p>\n<h3>Experience Awards</h3>\n<p>As well as the usual rewards for good roleplaying, you may reward the Characters with the following experience points.</p>\n<p>@Exp[20, Planning]{20–100 XP for quality of planning}. Reward both common sense and ingenious (but not foolhardy!) ideas. Feel free to give a higher award to the Character who consistently came up with the most clever suggestions.</p>\n<p>@Exp[15, Dealt with a Kidnapper]{15 XP for dealing with each of the kidnappers — and the dog!} Capturing Claudia alive and handing her over to the authorities is worth an extra 20 points each, and nets the Characters substantial reward money — Claudia is wanted on a number of charges from extortion to arson.</p>\n<p>@Exp[30, Rescued Sigismund]{30 XP for rescuing Sigismund (more or less) intact.}</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-laurel-skull.webp\" width=\"225\" height=\"249\" /></div>","folder":"iPFjTnKXVnElPe6X","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"A Little Help From My (New) Friends","sort":300000}}}
{"_id":"nAvIeCzTvTvMat4P","name":"Assassinations","content":"<p>Yegard Weill, a priest of Morr, sent @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Captain Schutzmann} a notice regarding several recent murders in the city. The Captain asks the Characters to investigate. The line of inquiry is a viable one, though the Characters may come to regret their involvement, the Skaven Clan Eshin’s Master Assassin is stalking Middenheim killing targets who threaten the Skaven’s plans or have seen ‘too much’. Professor @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Eunice Hachse} is his next target.</p>\n<p>Whilst this section of the adventure can be instigated at any time it is probably best if the Characters are already familiar with @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Professor Hasche} having completed the @JournalEntry[Zk1cJmV9NRTkK6NC]{Cover Up}.</p>\n<h3>Clan Eshin In Middenheim</h3>\n<p>Clan Eshin are the most secretive of all Skaven — masters of stealth, poison, deceit, and murder. Wielding deadly arts learned long ago in distant Cathay, they act as the unseen hand of the Council of Thirteen, ferreting out secrets, sabotaging rivals, and assassinating ‘threats’, and working as mercenaries for other clans. The Eshin maintain a small coterie in Under-Middenheim, ostensibly to assist Clan Scrutens on a contractual basis. Castellan-Warlord Gnawretch Skrray, suspects they also spy on him for their masters (he’s right) but finds them useful all the same. Clan Mange has paid dearly to secure Master Assassin Fleer Twitchkill’s services.  He has been murdering targets at their behest. </p>\n<h3>Corpse Inquiry</h3>\n<p>Located in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.9S51a44wvQCES1CR]{Sudgarten}, the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.u9uiiDA6oT5T8U6a]{Morrspark} also holds the city’s only burial ground. Characters asking about unusual deaths are directed here.</p>\n<p>The graveyard is a warren of burial chambers; plots are limited and expensive. Characters asking about unusual deaths, or specifically for ‘Weill’ are directed to a middle-aged priest with a thickening frame and a bright blue-green glass eye. While Yegard’s ill-fitting blue glass eye is eye-catching,  it occasionally falls out when he grows animated. Fortunately, he is used to catching and replacing it in a deft manoeuvre.</p>\n<p>Asking about the ‘unusual deaths’ piques his interest.<em> ‘Ah yes, those murders, strange, indeed.’</em> Weill produces a mortician’s ledger; after checking particulars, he mentions three murders within the last week. The victims  moved in different circles and were murdered in different locations — yet there was an apparent connection — each was killed with a triangular blade.         </p>\n<h4>Ansten Krohn — The Civil Engineer</h4>\n<p>Ansten’s body was found in an alley in Nordtor. He was killed by a single blade thrust to the back of the skull. The wound was unusual — the blade was triangular. His wife, Britte Krohn, a resident of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.KwjEw2JxTKFp4X03]{the Wynd}, paid for his funeral, and his body was placed in the Eternal Flame.</p>\n<p>Britte is a clerk for the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.fofmTR3LuoaMVLa0]{Komission of Public Works}. Ansten was a civil engineer for the Komission, responsible for upkeep for Middenheim’s monuments, streets, and sewer system. Still mourning her husband’s death, Britte wants justice. </p>\n<p>Britte has no idea who killed Ansten. He had no enemies and not much to steal. Ansten had been working on a map of the sewers and upper tunnels of the Fauschlag, in preparation of sealing off the sewers from the lower tunnels: to make them cleaner and more efficient. His body was found close to one of the larger sewer grates. All of his notes on the undercity have vanished. Britte states that she just thinks they’ve been misplaced as,<em> ‘nobody cared about fixing the sewers as much as Ansten’.</em></p>\n<p>Krohn was killed because the Skaven exploit the porous nature of the sewers. Yellow Fang cultists stole his papers to prevent his work continuing.</p>\n<h4>Yiva — The Burglar</h4>\n<p>Yiva is listed as a grocer, whose body was found in an abandoned apartment in @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.y4MpfiD6PHBOAdX0]{Sudtor}. Like Krohn, she was killed by a single thrust to the back of a skull with a triangular blade. She was given a Pauper’s Funeral attended by friends from the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.Oy2WPyRsa08bFLEE]{Labourers’ Hospice}, Morr’s blessings, and sent over the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.u9uiiDA6oT5T8U6a]{Cliff of Sighs}. </p>\n<p>Further investigation in Sudtor is met with hostility, and Hospice staff claim to have never met Yiva. Careful inquiry will reveal that Yiva was a burglar working for @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.CjgruxP6bLU7tW1y]{The Man}. It will take coin and the right brokers (@Actor[D17cqCKU6D4AzdPI]{Alfric Half-Nose}) to determine that Yiva was employed by The Man, and to discover which parts of the sewers were heavily patrolled by the Sewer Jacks. Her last report indicated that she ‘had seen something she could barely believe’, and had dangerous, blackmail material on one of the Jack Captains. Yiva’s body was found  the next day.</p>\n<p>Yiva came upon a meeting between Yellow Fang Sewer Jack Captain, @Actor[uL6CLyF3u6QpRDQ9]{Raina Müs}, and her Skaven contact. While Yiva thought she hadn’t been noticed, the Skaven picked up her scent and marked her for elimination.</p>\n<h4>Haludan Gerg — The Sewer Jack</h4>\n<p>Sewer Jack Haludan Gerg’s place of death and the circumstances were withheld, though it was noted at his funeral that he ‘died defending Middenheim’, when he was buried at the edge of the Warrenburg. He had been slashed multiple times and stabbed in the chest with a triangular blade.</p>\n<p>Characters investigating will be directed to ask after Sewer Jacks at the Watch office on the Square of Martials. Questions soon lead them to the most-scarred and formidable-looking Halfling they’ve ever met, Jacko Warble, Commander of Middenheim’s Sewer Jacks (see @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-journals.j0YM1Bz8nObuMMVB]{Initial Inquiries: The Skaven}). Unless he knows them, Warble will have some pointed questions, but once the Characters indicate they work for Schutzmann, he becomes cooperative. Asking about Skaven makes him guarded, but he reluctantly says that the Sewer Jacks occasionally tangle with ‘rat headed Beastmen’ with a habit of collapsing tunnels in Middenheim’s Undercity.</p>\n<p>Warble says Haludan was a valiant man, but he can’t tell the Characters much other than that his body was found in a sewer beneath @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.ZWV1AbhVVbWfbEIz]{Neumarkt}. If told about the ‘triangular blade’, he says: ‘<em>Be careful. You don’t want to cross anyone that could take Haludan.’ </em>He hands a folded hide out to the Characters. <em>‘Haludan had that clutched in a death grip. I hope it helps you nail whoever did this.’ </em></p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/handouts/pelt-diagram2.webp\" width=\"277\" height=\"352\" /></div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[PdiS4r0xSbxrijBz]{Pelt 2}</div>\n<p>The hide is covered with odd-shaped runes and unusual markings. It appears to be a map of some kind, but it is difficult to discern. Any Character can make a <strong>Difficult (–10) Intuition</strong> Test – <strong>Average (+20)</strong> if they have any Cartography — to realise the map shows a portion of Middenheim from below. There are grey lines that show sewers and tunnels, with black and yellow runes at various points. Most striking are three  blood-red triangular shaped runes (the Horned Rat’s Sigil): </p>\n<ul>\n<li>one with notations of some sort, including a red line tracing along a sewer beneath @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.jGfyLhox6OTD75oi]{Nordtor} (Ansten’s remains) <br /><br /></li>\n<li>one with several markings beneath @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.y4MpfiD6PHBOAdX0]{Sudtor} (Yiva’s remains)<br /><br /></li>\n<li>one over a portion of Freiburg, just south of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica} (Hasche’s residence)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Haludan came upon the assassin consulting his map and they fought.  Haludan grabbed the map which depicts, among other things, a target mark over Hachse’s residence. </p>\n<h4>What Do We Know?</h4>\n<p>The weapon and the sewers are the links between the murders. The Characters may deduce that Haludan’s death was not premeditated, but as result of stumbling upon the assassin. Intuitive Characters can guess that keeping the sewers in disrepair, avoiding conflict between the Sewer Jacks and the Low Kings is in the Skaven’s best interest. These insights can be granted by passing a <strong>Difficult (–10) Intuition</strong> Test if Players don’t realise them themselves.</p>\n<p>The Characters may realise that @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Hachse} is in mortal danger. If they don’t tie the pieces together in time, by not following the clues, or giving other matters priority, they eventually hear that Hachse’s body was found in the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{Great Park} with a single wound to the back of the skull, made with a triangular blade. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/handouts/pelt-diagram1.webp\" width=\"277\" height=\"352\" /></div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[gzxKQZRxDfGrp4fh]{Pelt 1}</div>\n<h3>Guarding Eunice</h3>\n<p>@Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Eunice} lives in a third-floor flat in the southern end of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.hDeFkdQZ2g2fT0it]{Freiburg} overlooking the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.UKg34kCy7l7dsEjx]{Great Park}. Characters with the Skaven Map may correctly reason that one of the red runes overlays her apartment. No matter how persuasive they may be, no one is likely to believe the Characters if they insist that a Skaven Assassin is hunting the Professor. For her part, Hasche will be sceptical that she is in danger, but will listen to the Characters with focused intent. She’ll look at the map, if they show it to her, studying the runes intently. She taps the crimson Skaven rune over her flat agreeing,‘This does seem ominous.’</p>\n<p>Eunice offers tea and insists on going to the Altmarkt to buy provisions to feed her ‘guests’. It takes a <strong>Difficult (–10) Charm</strong> Test to talk her out of it, but she insists on sending one of the Characters with a very-particular shopping list. If they cannot, play up trying to guard Eunice as she wanders through the Altmarkt. If they question her, she smiles and says, <em>‘How can I be in danger when the courageous folk who saved the Graf himself are guarding me?’</em> or words to that effect.</p>\n<p>Let the Characters make whatever preparations they want in the time they have. @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Hasche} is willing to listen to some reason, and could even be convinced to allow them to set up a trap in her home, but she cannot be talked out of leaving her apartment to be guarded elsewhere from a threat that may not exist.</p>\n<h3>The Assassin</h3>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/fleer-twitchkill.webp\" width=\"330\" height=\"334\" /></div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"text-align:center\">@Actor[hEeKB7frieZ7ru74]{Fleer Twitchkill}</div>\n<p>The Skaven of Clan Eshin spend years perfecting their fighting and subterfuge skills. While even the least of their members are swift and lethal, most are deemed expendable by their masters, and die before they are considered for the vaunted rank of Death Runner, much less the pinnacle of their killing arts: Clan Eshin Master Assassin. Unlike the majority of Skaven, Master Assassins often work alone. They have a myriad of deadly skills and each has their own preferences in how they choose to operate and deal out murder. </p>\n<h4>Fighting the Assassin</h4>\n<p>You should make this one a fight to remember. Fleer Twitchkill is an exceedingly deadly foe, who does not care about the Characters — for the moment — they are merely obstacles on the way to his real target. </p>\n<p>The assassin arrives in ‘Middenheim Above’ in the early evening and will study @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Hachse’s} apartment from a nearby rooftop, looking for anything out of the ordinary. He strikes late at night, using his near preternatural stealth to slip in and kill her. His plan is to climb up the side of the building and enter through a window. He doesn’t expect any resistance, even if she has protection, he assumes they’ll not be aware of his presence until it is too late. He will attempt to charge past any foes, leaping past them to kill Eunice swiftly before retreating. </p>\n<p>He’ll target obvious Wizards with a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.qfd01sggD9xbCuJY]{Black Lotus} coated throwing blade immediately before moving on to eliminate Elves and armoured warriors. Emphasise his ‘wispy’ presence, due to the effects of his cloak. He often appears as a fast-moving shadow, with gleaming green eyes and the flash of a tarnished sword. Describe attacks passing right through him without harm, trailing a wisp of shadow with them, whenever his Ward save prevents him from taking damage. </p>\n<p>Note his great speed, ability to run along walls, and crawl over ceilings. To get past a foe, he may leap up to the ceiling, then rapidly scuttle over it, past a blocking Character to drop down on the Professor. If the fight goes into the street, he’ll rapidly traverse the sides of buildings, hurling throwing blades with deadly accuracy as he runs across the cityscape, before leaping back to attack from on high.</p>\n<p>The Skaven Assassin will not stop until his target is dead, or he is.</p>\n<h4>The Aftermath</h4>\n<p>If the Characters kill @Actor[hEeKB7frieZ7ru74]{Fleer} before he kills @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Hachse} and flees, a remarkable thing happens: his body dissolves due to the effects of the Eshin @Item[K3ZnbunH6RNTLDbw]{Traceless Demise} spell. His flesh disintegrates into nothing, a process that can only be stopped by a swift counterspell. When it is finished, all that remains is a stained piece of cloth (the @Item[placeholder for v10]{Shadow Cloak}), his triangular blade, and several Skaven-symbol shaped throwing blades.</p>\n<p>The blades add to the evidence the Characters are gathering on Skaven existence. If they’ve managed to save @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Hachse}, she makes for a powerful ally in convincing the Graf of  Skaven existence and their threat to Middenheim.

{"_id":"oU0MtvOgNpDAMJgB","name":"Purrsecution","content":"<p>Purrsecution is a series of events that can be weaved throughout the early stages of the Character’s investigations. Yellow Fang agents have convinced Middenheim’s Komission of Public Works to help them cull Middenheim’s cats, all the better to protect a spying device called Akoustikk Ratty. Once the Characters have eliminated Akoustikk Ratty, or have had an @JournalEntry[cKxMqupzYtcrYJPH]{Audience with the Graf} the Komission stops offering a bounty on cats and the various phenomena described here come to a stop. </p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack} fears that the man-things of Middenheim might uncover his plans and arrange to stop him. He has forged contacts with the Yellow Fang in the city to help him cover his tracks, but has also constructed an ingenious spying device.</p>\n<p>This is the @JournalEntry[OumwebV2i2Oh0fKI]{Akoustikk Ratty}, a re-animated rat partially rebuilt with clockwork and fitted with an ingenious contraption capable of recording sound, powered by a fragment of Warpstone. It would be ideal for spying on the humans above ground. Conversation can only be accurately recorded quite close-up, so the clockwork rat is programmed to sneak up in the shadows unnoticed.</p>\n<h4>Back to the Drawing Board</h4>\n<p>@JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss} is currently operating Mark 2 of his invention. Mark 1 met a messy fate at the claws of Myrtle, Watch Commander @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann’s} cat. The Warlock Engineer had to rebuild the construct from scratch. An improvement on Mk1 is the ingenious cantrip Maliss incorporated that allows him to see what the Akoustikk Ratty sees via a crystal ball. He can also remotely control the Ratty’s movements using a hand-held device — a box with a protruding handle, which Maliss has dubbed a ‘Misery Stick’.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss} had not anticipated that a cat would prove the downfall of his masterplan. Before he could unleash Akoustikk Ratty Mk2 on the world, he decided that cats had to be eliminated from Middenheim. Maliss garneried the resources of the Yellow Fang, ordering them to suppress Middenheim’s moggies. They started with Myrtle, which was a total catastrophe for Shutzmann. </p>\n<h4>Plots and Schemes</h4>\n<p>The Yellow Fang carries out the will of their Skaven masters with various schemes and plots, which have been put in action over the past few weeks (the destruction of Akoustikk Ratty Mk1 took place about a month ago). Dr Lanzaro Lindwurm is the chief agent overseeing the pussy persecution. The medical professor is a prominent member of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}, a secret Yellow Fang cultist, and Professor @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Eunice Hasche’s} arch-enemy (see @JournalEntry[Zk1cJmV9NRTkK6NC]{The Cover Up}). </p>\n<p>An outbreak of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.UAwTqZ3hqNb7vq9s]{Itching Pox} in Middenheim, as uncomfortable as it is ultimately deadly, is used by Lindwurm as the excuse to purge the city’s cat population. He has convinced Middenheim’s @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.fofmTR3LuoaMVLa0]{Komission of Public Works} that he has uncovered a link between the dreaded pox and a microscopic organism that inhabits cat fur. The best cure for the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.UAwTqZ3hqNb7vq9s]{Itching Pox}, he declares in a widely disseminated medical treatise ‘<em>The Cat — an Underappreciated Vector in the Transmission of Endoparasites, Disease, New Millennialism, and Daemonic Manifestation</em>’, is to cull the species Felis Catus, thus eliminating the disease at its source.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>DR LANZARO LINDWURM</em></h3>\n<p><em>The Characters can meet the doctor at his study in the |Collegium Theologica during daylight hours. He is eager to talk to the public about how cats are dangerous vectors of disease, and has a number of dry academic studies and files of carefully doctored data to back up his claims.</em></p>\n<p><em>Dr Lindwurm is a thin man, with a shock of blond hair, an unruly moustache, a missing front incisor,  and purple-tinted spectacles balanced on his bulbous nose. His black scholarly robes are in need of a good clean. He is insistent that cats spread Itching Pox, and the only way this disease can be fought is by culling the cat population. The Doctor tries to appeal to the Characters’ sense of civic duty to do all they can to help combat the disease.</em></p>\n<p><em>If he discovers that the Characters know @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Professor Hasche}, he tries to persuade them that she is a crank, and that she achieved her seat through nepotism, riding on the coattails of her late father, the esteemed Professor Justus Hasche. He has nothing but contempt for Eunice. On the face of it this seems like sheer scholarly rivalry, but in truth it is because of her research into the existence of Skaven, revealing things the Yellow Fang would rather keep hidden. </em></p>\n<p><em>Lindwurm is unaware of the @Actor[8HeX6KR3xhVg0Zl4]{Akoustikk Ratty’s} existence. He has merely been ordered by his Skaven contacts to eliminate all cats. He does as he’s told, no questions asked. The fact that Lindwurm is allergic to cats is neither here nor there. </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The Cull</h3>\n<p>The GM can seed the following as minor occurrences. They happen as the Characters move about Middenheim in the early days of the adventure. In each case, the Characters can be passive witnesses, or involve themselves in the action.</p>\n<h4>The Cat’s in the Bag</h4>\n<p>@Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.fofmTR3LuoaMVLa0]{The Komission of Public Works} has offered a bounty on cats’ in a desperate bid to eliminate the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.UAwTqZ3hqNb7vq9s]{Itching Pox}. A reward of 1d a cat makes this a lucrative trade for the city’s urchins. </p>\n<p>A couple of ragged street urchins, Tom and Kittë, are fighting like cats in a bag in the middle of the road. Ironically, a cat in a bag is exactly what they are fighting over. The unfortunate creatures yowls from inside the rough burlap sack as the two tustle over it. If the Characters intervene. ‘<em>This geezer giz us a penny fer each moggy ‘e gets.</em>’</p>\n<p>Both starvelings are desperate to win the bounty. Unless the Characters come to a fair arrangement between them, they’ll start fighting ferociously again. Meanwhile, a third urchin, watching from an alleyway, darts out during the chaos and tries to snatch the bag. </p>\n<p>The urchins won’t divulge the procurer of cats as they want to keep the pennies he pays for themselves. If the Characters track the urchins, or persuade them to confess (a silver schilling would be a fortune to them), they discover that the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.fofmTR3LuoaMVLa0]{Komission of Public Works} is the source of the bounty.</p>\n<p>An officious clerk at the Komission handles the bounties. He can be bribed or intimidated into giving Dr Lindwurm and Hauke Ayinger, a secretary of Middenheim’s @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.I86oiOppQimWvWaP]{Ratters’ Guild} (see @JournalEntry[Dj4BkkwyitJfK0NZ]{The Black Hunger}) as the people who convinced the Komission to take action.</p>\n<h4>Moggy Medical Misery</h4>\n<p>Dr Lindwurm’s treatise is widely read among Middenheim’s medical fraternity. Throughout the city, barber-surgeons encourage their patients to bring the animals to them for ‘processing.’ A crowd of citizens gather outside a barber-surgeon’s premises. They are all clutching cats that are yowling and trying to wriggle free. </p>\n<p>The barber-surgeon, a bald, sweating heavily-jowled man, and his young assistant, are collecting the cats and gleefully processing them. The unfortunate creatures vanish into the back of the surgery. A short but loud few minutes later, one of the barber-surgeon’s assistants returns with a putrid bottle labelled ‘Hessence of Catt’ — a purported cure for Itching Pox. For a small fee, folk can turn their kitty from beloved (or tolerated) family pet to medicinal draught in less than an hour. </p>\n<p>The barber-surgeon has a spare copy of Dr Lindwurm’s treatise explaining this as the appropriate treatment for @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.UAwTqZ3hqNb7vq9s]{Itching Pox}, which he provides to the Characters if they express an interest. </p>\n<p>A Character who reads the tract and passes an <strong>Easy (+40) Lore (Science)</strong> or <strong>Easy (+40) Lore (Medicine) </strong>Test can ascertain that it is so much claptrap and blather — though it seems impressive to anyone without a medical background. Lindwurm wrote his treatise to serve the ambitions of the Skaven. There is no scientific rationale behind his claims at all.</p>\n<h4>Cataclysm</h4>\n<p>Stepping out of an alleyway, the Characters notice a curious sight — a rat catcher emerges from darkness onto the street with three dead cats on the end of his rat catcher’s pole. </p>\n<p>If they engage him in conversation, he introduces himself as Piet Schädling and tells them that cat-catching is the current policy recently introduced by the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.I86oiOppQimWvWaP]{Ratters’ Guild}, and most of his fellow catchers have turned their attention on the city cats as a result. He is offered a small bounty per cat he brings to the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.fofmTR3LuoaMVLa0]{Komission of Public Works}. The official reason is that cats spread @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.UAwTqZ3hqNb7vq9s]{Itching Pox}, so need to be destroyed to stop the disease. However, he confesses that the fewer cats around, the more rats there’ll be for rat catchers to catch, which is good for business. </p>\n<p>Later on the Characters see a rat catcher accosted by an irate shop-owner who berates the Ratters’ Guild for letting his premises become infested with vermin. ‘Not my problem,’ replies the rat catcher. ‘I’m catching cats today. Orders from above.’ Other local business owners join in, and soon the rat catcher is surrounded by furious citizens, threatening him with violence if he doesn’t sort out their rat problem right away. </p>\n<p>If the Characters visit the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.I86oiOppQimWvWaP]{Ratters’ Guild} they are met by guild secretary Isaak Köstritzer. He is not happy at the way the guild is abandoning its traditional responsibilities and ridding the city of cats. He confides with the Characters that it’s down to the avarice of the guild leadership. He holds particular scorn for one of them, another guild secretary named Hauke Ayinger, who has been instrumental in pushing this new policy. Köstritzer also states that the recent turmoil amongst the Law Lords have made it easier for half-baked ideas to become policy. He does not believe that Ayinger is concerned with public health — he’s doing it to drum up work for the guild. ‘Fewer cats, more rats could be his motto’ he spits in contempt. </p>\n<p>Ayinger is a member of the Yellow Fang. He is a short, middle-aged man, with a mop of dark hair, a missing front incisor, and tinted round spectacles. He is richly dressed in fine clothes. He is short of temper, as well as of stature, and despite his height, manages to look down his nose at those he believes are below his rank. He is obsequious to those he deems his social superiors. </p>\n<p>If Ayinger can be followed unnoticed, every second evening at seven o’clock he meets Karl Zeigenalter (see @JournalEntry[Zk1cJmV9NRTkK6NC]{The Cover Up}) at a lively tavern called @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.s25z8m71qxje6Xor]{The Tardy Ass}. Characters who pass a <strong>Hard (–10) Stealth (Urban) </strong>Test followed by a <strong>Hard (–10) Perception</strong> Test are able to hear the following snatch of pertinent conversation as Ayinger states, ‘so you can let Lindwurm know that for the time being the Komission are willing to fund the cull, but such extravagance can’t be guaranteed to last’. </p>\n<p>If the Characters confront the men, Zeigenalter produces a stream of babble but refuses to answer questions — his devotion to the Skaven is so great that not even torture or the threat of death persuade him to talk. Ayinger claims that it was a meeting of acquaintances — a social event. If pressed why he is friends with Zeigenalter, he claims that the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.I86oiOppQimWvWaP]{Ratters’ Guild} benefits from the latest research to come out of the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}. At the end of this meeting Zeigenalter returns to the Collegium Theologica. Ayinger heads out and to the nearest manhole. Checking that he isn’t observed he heads down into the sewers.</p>\n<p>If Characters wish to shadow Ayinger they must make a <strong>Hard (–10) Navigation</strong> Test to travel the Undercity to the Upper Tunnels. If they are successful they come to a small cavern in which Ayinger speaks to a Clan Mange scout. Characters overhear him say ‘Please let the master know that the cull proceeds, your little spies can complete their great work in safety’. </p>\n<p>If the Characters intervene the Skaven flees and Ayinger fights ferociously. If captured and intimidated he claims he believes the Skaven use rats as spies.</p>\n<h4>A Feline Feast</h4>\n<p>The Characters pass a cart in the middle of a square with a large cage loaded on the back. A rather tired looking donkey is hitched to the vehicle, stoically chewing on some hay, while a broad shouldered man bellows about the pressing need for cats outside the city, in the wider @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-scenes.KIXHWLTroXF59wDs]{Grand Duchy of Middenheim}.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Step up, step up, and do your patriotic duty! Rats are abroad in great numbers, and the grain stores across the duchy fall prey to vile vermin! Gather up your fat city cats and make them earn their keep!’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saucers of milk line surround the cart, and as cats gather, the man scoops them up and deposits them in the cage on the back of his cart. This is supplemented by the occasional citizen who tearfully hands over a prized pet ‘<em>for the good of Middenheim</em>.’ If questioned the tout gives his name as Marius Lazard, and explains that he is just a concerned citizen trying to deal with the rats that plague the farms and villages around Middenheim. This is partially true — there have been more rats of late — but Marius is no good samaratin. He is being paid by Professor Lindworm (see above) to collect as many cats as he can. </p>\n<p>Each evening he takes his load of yeowling cats to the forests at the base of the Fauschlag, purportedly to take them to surrounding farms and villages. Despite his grift Marius is an animal lover, and can’t bring himself to simply toss the animals off the Fauschlag, as Dr. Lindworm suggested. Instead, he simply releases the animals into the forest to join their increasingly feral kin from previous days. The Characters can learn this easily by following him, or simply noting how little time it takes him to travel ‘all around the Grand Duchy’.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/cat-catcher.webp","folder":"mYau9ASs23EVayYn","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Purrsecution","sort":-100000}}}
{"_id":"onAzmWqyt35DC8k1","name":"Part One: The Shadow of the Gravelord","content":"<p>This scene takes place during @JournalEntry[0Vz07cD1Twe2VB1Z]{Mysterious Thefts} of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. The day after the Characters interview Agnise Fuensterburg, there is a second break-in at the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.0L20mJ6knecZypX7]{Collegium Theologica}. Despite the increased guard presence — @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann} assigned two of the Watch to keep an eye on things there — someone was able to enter the library and escape unseen with a number of tomes related to necromancy and the undead. However, what sets this apart from the previous theft is that there is a suspect. Professor Gunter Krämer, an elderly scholar of botany, was seen by the guards entering the library after hours. He had every right to be there and the guards on duty waved him through. An hour later, the two guards realised that neither had seen him leave, and one entered the library to find an entire shelf of books in disarray, but no sign of the professor. After alerting Agnise Fuensterburg, reshelving the books, and checking it against the catalog, it was apparent some volumes were missing. Each of the missing items dealt with the undead and the various necromancers that have troubled Middenheim over its long history.</p>\n<h3>What Happened?</h3>\n<p>In fact, Professor Krämer was dead before he ever entered the library, murdered and raised by the Gravelord to infiltrate the building after he noted the increased security. The Professor walked past the guards, gathered every book on the shelf (zombies not being noted readers), and showed them one at a time to his master, who waited just outside beyond a barred window. The Gravelord would have had his servant simply walk out with the books, but he did not trust the creature to be able to get past the guards a second time, especially if asked to explain the sizable pile of books he was laden down with. </p>\n<p>The unfortunate corpse of Professor Krämer has, at the Gravelord’s orders, hidden itself away in a storage cupboard beneath the stairs. It has yet to be found as the cupboard is far too small to hide a living person of the Professor’s size, and the zombie pulverised most of its bones squeezing inside.</p>\n<p>This is a prelude to the adventure, intended to foreshadow the later incidents and let the Players know that @Actor[r4AUsjsfOL9HW8lO]{Gräber} will be crossing their path again. Although there is no immediate threat, the Characters should call to mind their previous encounters with this megalomaniacal but somewhat ridiculous necromancer.</p>\n<h3>A Supplementary Report</h3>\n<p>During the early stages of <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>, the Characters work with Watch Commander @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Ulrich Schutzmann} investigating the remnants of the Purple Hand in Middenheim, and from there pursuing rumours of and connections to the Skaven. This adventure begins with one more tale that can be woven into the many threads of conspiracy and plot that come to light during this part of <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>. </p>\n<p>The Characters are informed of the theft a few hours after it is discovered the following morning. Though the method and style is clearly different, as the original thief left behind no mess, it would be foolish not to investigate whether the thefts are related. If the Characters have already met the Low King Bleyden, he assured them that he had nothing to do with it, but even so most Characters will wish to know what happened. If they seem reluctant to investigate, have the Ranaldan or Schutzmann point out that whoever hired Bleyden may have hired others as well. The Characters would do well to at least ascertain what was taken to see if it is related to any of the already missing items.</p>\n<h3>At The Collegium</h3>\n<p>The Characters arrive at the college to the guards turning away angry scholars from the building’s imposing doors. Without so much as looking at them, the guards give the Characters the same treatment, saying <em>‘I apologise, but the library is currently closed. Watch business.’ </em>However, if the Characters flash Schutzmann’s seal, or remind the guards that they were here only yesterday, the pair sheepishly let them inside.</p>\n<h4>Interviewing Agnise</h4>\n<p>Agnise Fuensterburg is busy consulting the library catalogue as the Characters enter, but looks up and gives them an exasperated sigh as they walk in. She is not displeased to see the Characters, but is understandably frustrated with the plague of larceny infecting her library. She offers the Characters a seat but otherwise wishes to get right down to business.</p>\n<p>Agnise can, once again, provide a list of the stolen books, as well as the following information.</p>\n<p>Characters succeeding on an <strong>Average (+20) Charm</strong> Test can learn from Agnise that she suspects the guards simply fell asleep, failing to notice either Professor Krämer leave or the thief enter and make off with the books.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>LITERARY LARCENY</em></h3>\n<p><em>The following books are missing from the library.</em></p>\n<p>Bile and Darkness: A Guide to Necromancers of the Middle Mountains <em>by Henrietta Gotenfrau, on the various necromancers to trouble Middenheim, written in 2415 IC.</em></p>\n<p>Dead is Better<em>, a treatise on the cursed nature of the undead and the methods and means of their disposal, written by Malthus Morto in 1984 IC. Agnise chimes in that this work is widely considered to be quite useless, and has been blamed for the deaths of countless Witch Hunters over the years.</em></p>\n<p>Tell No Tales<em>, a translation of a Tilean volume consisting of seven transcripts, purported to be conversations between a Tilean sailor and an undead Khemrian noblewoman. The book deals with the types and nature of various creatures, such as Skeletons, Zombies, Vampires, and more. It ends with the sailor leaving his home behind to return to Khemri in search of the noblewoman. Agnise mentions lightly that some find the tome morosely romantic, but that she has never had time to read it. Published in 2115 IC.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/actors/night-watch.webp\" width=\"305\" height=\"233\" /></div>\n<h3>Tired Troopers</h3>\n<p>Gregor and Ilse were the guards on watch during the theft, and the pair have remained in the library awaiting whatever investigators look into the matter. Both are somewhat nervous, as they fear they will be blamed for the theft, but both enjoy a deserved reputation as conscientious members of the Watch and hope it will carry them through. Neither slept last night, and both are quite tired. As the Characters approach, in fact, they hear Gregor mention that he’s been awake so long he’s starting to hear things. If asked what he is referring to, he says he swears he could hear some banging coming from the wall by the stairs, but suspects he is simply tired.</p>\n<p>Gregor and Ilse both give the same story whether interviewed alone or together, and it is the truth of what they have seen. Gregor is careful and deliberate, while Ilse is inclined to include fairly incidental details in her explanation —<em> ‘It was two bells after midnight, which I remember as I saw two black cats wander by just then and I thought well, what a coincidence! You don’t see many cats these days, might be the pox. Anyway, the professor wanders up and …’</em></p>\n<p>Regardless, both deliver the same general story. The professor arrived late at night, sometime after midnight. Both heard him say <em>‘I am Professor Krämer, please let me in’</em>, though Ilse notes that his voice sounded like that of a much younger man. The pair unlocked the door and allowed him entrance, as it is not unheard of for scholars to keep odd hours. Gregor notes that he walked with an unsteady gait, but he thought it to be more a matter of his advanced age than any drunkenness. About an hour later, wishing to lock the door, Ilse entered the library looking for Krämer. She found the books from one shelf strewn across the floor and the professor missing. She points out that the library was particularly cold, as though a window had been left open, but when she checked all were closed. If the Characters think to ask if the windows were all locked — you may allow them a <strong>Challenging (+0) Intuition</strong> Test to think of this — Ilse mentions that in fact one was not, but she didn’t think much of it as the window had bars on the outside with gaps less than a hand thick. There is no way the professor could have left via the window.</p>\n<p>Investigation of the library itself confirms this story, as it is indeed what happened.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-skulls.webp\" width=\"199\" height=\"214\" /></div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">THE KNOCKING IN THE WALLS</h3>\n<p>If the Characters search the library, allow them to make Challenging (+0) Perception Tests.

Feel free to continue adding details to your description of the stain’s colour, shape, texture, scent and so on for as long as the Character continues to investigate it.</p>\n<h4>Bile</h4>\n<p>The professor’s last meal, finally expelled by a stomach no longer capable of digesting it, lies just in front of the window where the creature passed books out to the Gravelord. Agnise has noted the smell, but has yet to find its source.</p>\n<h4>Fingerprints</h4>\n<p>The window is covered in smudged fingerprints where the creature struggled to open it. Characters who think to open the window will discover the professor’s severed fingertip jammed into the frame, lost when the window slammed shut on the creature’s hand.</p>\n<h4>Professor Krämer</h4>\n<p>The unfortunate professor is well and truly dead, raised as a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombie} by the Gravelord, who then used him to access the library and pass the three missing books through the window. Of course, the zombie had to first hold each and every book up where the Gravelord could see it, hence why the entire shelf was cleared. Then, at his master’s orders, the professor stuffed himself into a cupboard beneath the stairs leading to the reading rooms above, and which could barely fit a Halfling standing upright. The Characters can follow the sounds of his knocking — the creature is still trying to fit itself further into the cupboard due to the Gravelord’s poorly worded order — to find this hiding place. The Zombie is a mess of cold flesh and broken bone, limbs and neck at unnatural angles. </p>\n<p>Opening the door causes the creature’s hand to fall out of the cupboard, the frayed sinews no longer enough to hold the door closed. The guards or Agnise can all easily identify the creature as the late professor from what remains of his face and his rather striking turquoise brocade. The guards both shudder grimly, while Agnise lets out a shriek that brings anyone who hears it running.</p>\n<p>With a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test a Character may spot, nestled into his shirt pocket, a note that reads, <em>‘In Death I Served the Gravelord!’</em></p>\n<p>If the Characters do not locate the professor, Agnise is drawn by his knocking shortly after they leave, her terrified shriek audible just as they begin to walk away from the library.</p>\n<h3>Reporting Back</h3>\n<p>There is little else to find in the library, and once the Characters have seen the note and recognised their old nemesis is now in the city, the scene has served its purpose. They may wish to dispose of the professor themselves, in which case describe the rather awful job involved in prying the thing out of the cupboard without getting bitten in as much detail as you like.</p>\n<p>If any Character wonders aloud how the creature was able to talk its way past the guards, and in a younger man’s voice at that, you may allow any Character to make an <strong>Average (+20) Lore (Magic)</strong> Test to recall that the spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.pDvOunMrvaYoXjd9]{Murmured Whisper} allows a Character to throw their voice quite perfectly. This is exactly what the Gravelord did, watching his puppet approach the guards from the nearby shadows.</p>\n<p>Once the Characters have reported back to @Actor[jBamTcOi8iz3mYxe]{Schutzmann}, he is distraught at the idea of a necromancer in the city, but also notes that this would appear to be an unrelated incident. He urges the Characters to investigate this matter if they have time, and circulates the necromancer’s description — assuming the Characters can provide it from their previous encounters — to the Watch.</p>\n<p>A few hours later this pays off, as someone matching that description was seen leaving the city about an hour after the theft at the Collegium. In light of the various disturbances, the guards had orders to let no one leave, but this person was clearly some kind of wizard: he cast a spell that made the guards step back in terror, and was gone before they recovered. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Magic) </strong>Test allows a Character to surmise that the spell was either the Arcane Spell @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.J0wUSVSnos7fBprP]{Terrifying} or a very successful casting of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.neCKUJ2yMwEl6GAX]{Fearsome}. If they think to ask, they are told that this incident happened at the eastern city gates.</p>","folder":"xzib7Wt4bGWxCCv6","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"The Return of the Gravelord","sort":200000}}}
{"_id":"p3NPc0GWlUN3o8vt","name":"The First Stratum — Halls of Valaya","content":"<p>The grand entrance to Karak Skygg once granted admittance to the Entrance Hall, the Merchants Halls, brewery, granaries, storehouses, and kitchens. It was here that the Dwarfs received envoys from the world beyond, traded, and fed the population. The walls still bear carvings of the Ancestor Goddess of the Hearth and several toppled statues litter the rooms.</p>\n<p>The many slaves who work for the Warlock Engineer are kept prisoner on these floors, crammed into pens, and dragged to and from their labours as their masters see fit.</p>\n<h4>The Gate of Grungni</h4>\n<p>Standing, each leg straddling the main gate to the Hold, is a gargantuan statue of Grungi. Stone carvings are either side of him, implacable Dwarf faces which once housed great cannons projecting from their eyes, but now contain nests of rats.</p>\n<p>Through the main gates, new slaves and Clanrats enter the fortress, whipped by their masters. Checking the number of slaves brought in, and their quality, is Tiktik the Tally Rat. He sits with an abacus at the entrance, writing upon his scrolls, directing where the chattel should be taken.</p>\n<p>If the adventurers enter here as slaves they will come face to face with Tiktik, assessed as healthy, and told in broken Reikspiel that they will, ‘Work-toil hard, meaty man-things’. If they are disguised as Yellow Fang cultists, he sneers, and demands they praise him before admittance.</p>\n<h4>Tiktik the Tally Rat, Packmaster of Clan Skryre</h4>\n<p>@Actor[5ubijsSmCm1NFPqR]{Tiktik} appears wizened, for a Skaven. Grey hair trails from the end of his snout, and he hobbles about wincing with pain. His tail is not as long as it should be, because of an ancient injury. He carries scrolls, parchment, and a few vials of ink. His left index finger claw is long and shaped to act as a stylus for writing. A pair of spectacles sit on his snout  , and on brass armatures are numerous lenses that he uses to read closely and inspect slaves.</p>\n<p>@Actor[5ubijsSmCm1NFPqR]{Tiktik} sneers and tuts as he inspects all new slaves brought to him. He is no fool, but the increased number of slaves coming and going has made him less diligent when scrutinising them.</p>\n<h4>The Furnace</h4>\n<p>The Halls of Valaya once had an extensive bakery and kitchens to feed the hundreds of Dwarfs that lived here. Now the fires burn, fed by anything and everything the Skaven consider waste that can’t be fed into the Pit. These fires provide some heat, but primarily help to power the steam system that powers all manner of contraptions and devices within the Hold. The Skaven working the furnaces have patchwork hair, skin sore from burns, and their whiskers are singed almost down to the snout.</p>\n<p>Extinguishing the furnace slows the operation of the equipment far above in the fortress, namely the steam powered winches and equipment used to transport refined warpstone to the cannon. It won’t prevent the Moonbreaker from firing but causes panic amongst the Engineers. Further sabotage and stealth is much easier as the Skaven scramble to bring the furnace back to temperature, and argue and lay blame on each other.</p>\n<p>Food is still prepared in the old kitchens. Bubbling in large vats on hot coals are stinking volumes of ‘soup’, with hunks of meat bobbing about in it — this is the finest cuisine in Karak Skygg, reserved for the Clan Skryre masters. Packmasters, between berating their underlings and cracking whips, will come here to take a break, stir the soup, sip it, and then add some more ingredients. These slacking Skaven are ripe for ambush. The ingredients come from the storehouse and several rusting, blood-stained buckets. From a distance it appears that the soup is made from the off cuts of pigs. </p>\n<h4>The Slave Pens and Prisons </h4>\n<p>The former Merchants’ Halls now play host to slaves, in large cages, watched over by Slavemasters stationed in a former guardhouse. @Actor[E7pge5rgT241TLyD]{Skavenslaves} are kept separate to the unfortunate masses of human and Dwarf captives. If the party is captured and considered escaped slaves, they will be shoved into one of the cages with several slaves, including @Actor[t332rbwPtP1GMkmy]{Hetri} the Dwarf Scout</p>\n<p>The guards keep a small pack of savage @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.oenbbB0PitRWUBfZ]{Giant Rats}. Bred by Clan Moulder, these rats are the size of a small hound, and used to intimidate and occasionally tear apart the slaves. The Slavemasters keep them half-starved, and given the chance they would turn on their masters when easier prey is unavailable. Succeeding at a <strong>Hard (–20) Strength </strong>test breaks the lock on the Giant Rat cage, sending the unruly beasts out into the main hall and creating enough of a distraction for the adventurers to mess with the cages or sneak past.</p>\n<p>@Actor[t332rbwPtP1GMkmy]{Hetri Bittercrag}, Dwarf Slave</p>\n<p>The arrival of the Characters brightens her sallow face, and her heart will be filled with hope once more. She offers the Characters what information she can, but insists they help free her. She is immensely proud of her knowledge of the Middle Mountains. She was exploring around Karak Skygg to look for knowledge of the former inhabitants when she was captured.</p>\n<p>When encountered, @Actor[t332rbwPtP1GMkmy]{Hetri} is suffering from a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition that only escape from Karak Skygg and perhaps a pint of Bugman’s Best Bitter can hope to remove.</p>\n<p>Escaping the jail cell will require guile and subtlety, and Hetri points out that there is a path that they can take if they wish to enter the chamber where the Skaven leave all discarded equipment before they sort through it. Desperate Characters can take this route, but risk being discovered by the two Skaven who are sorting through the pile of clothes, armour, weapons and other items.</p>\n<h4>How did you get here?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘I was exploring Karak Skygg in hope of discovering something of my ancestors, but I was captured.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What is this place?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Thousands of years ago, when you manlings were in furs, my ancestors built mighty Karaks throughout these mountains. Many a Dwarf toiled beneath the ground to raise up citadels such as this, many clans made their home in this mountain, much cheer and many victories were sung in these halls. Karak Skygg was once a jewel in the crown of Karaz Ghumbul, but in their venerated wisdom, my ancestors chose to return to the heartland of Karaz Ankor. They sealed the gates with powerful runes and blessed the halls. The Runepriests declared the mountains accursed and departed. Great Thognar the Wise stood atop this mountain and bellowed, “In the name of Valaya…”’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>No, I mean… what is it now?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Den of foul Raki. Bastards can get in through the tiniest holes.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What are they doing?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘A terrible thing that will see the end of us all. They plan to shoot down the moon you call Morrslieb. We must stop them.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>How?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘I know the passageways here. The ancestors left their runes to guide me. With your help we can escape these cages. Then we can take a closer look at their weapon. If I can’t… then I’ll take the oath of the Slayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>The Storehouse</h4>\n<p>The storehouse is a series of enclosed rooms on several levels which open onto a central chamber. The whole place is piled high with the rotting carcasses of animals looted from farmsteads from about Middenland. Though buzzing with flies and maggots, these supplies provide food for the Hold. Behind a pile of the rotting meat is a secret entrance to the passageways within the fortress that the Skaven have not discovered, but @Actor[t332rbwPtP1GMkmy]{Hetri} can detect from concealed runes on the walls. The passageway here leads up to the @JournalEntry[5hlq3xE8w3btQyjP]{Refinery}.</p>\n<p>If the adventurers need to hide, this pile of cadavers and meat conceals their scent from the Skaven’s sensitive noses. Hiding for more than four Rounds in the rotting mass of meat requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Toughness </strong>Test to resist vomiting, and a further <strong>Average (+20) Toughness </strong>Test to avoid a case of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.diseases.txeLd7R13qxSvmsr]{Galloping Trots}.</p>","folder":"DTYjZfJMc8xgYikO","sort":150000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Locations","sort":150000}}}

{"_id":"r0sMNaRt0r37V3B2","name":"Malevolent Mountains","content":"<p>In order to work out what hazards are faced during the journey  the Characters should make a <strong>Difficult (-10) Navigation</strong> Test. Consult the following table to work out what hazards the Characters face. No matter how well the Characters do they must face Hidden Drops, Altitude Sickness, Landslides, and Deff Batz territory (unless they avoid hazards using @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline’s} map). Plus hazards mentioned in the table below.</p>\n<p>While few of the natural hazards of the Middle Mountains can be avoided entirely, the danger they pose can at least be reduced by a savvy Character. The Characters may prepare against some in advance, perhaps by insisting they tether each other to protect against falls, or being careful not to push themselves so they can acclimatise to the increased altitude. Feel free to let them discuss potential hazards and possible solutions. If the party becomes aware of a danger ahead give them a chance to prepare for it by passing a <strong>Challenging (+0) Outdoor Survival</strong> Test. Success allows a Character to anticipate any hazard. They may take precautions that will give the whole party a +1 SL bonus to any Tests required to navigate the hazard.</p>\n<h3>Inclement Weather</h3>\n<p>In the mountains bright, sunny weather can become a freezing downpour with zero visibility in minutes. An <strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong> Test allows a Character to spot warning signs in advance of a drastic weather change — certain species of flower closing up, slight temperature changes, and so on.</p>\n<p>Clouds gather over the next few minutes, and the temperature drops by 10 degrees. Visibility drops to 30 yards due to low cloud and fine drizzle. Then the wind picks up to gale force, lashing freezing rain against the Characters as they trudge onward, getting colder, wetter and more miserable by the minute. Good weatherproof clothing keeps out the worst of it, but the rain is fine enough to penetrate everywhere, and only a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.spells.NXHZ3RtPN3SrSH8I]{Protection from Rain} spell provides any real comfort.</p>\n<p>Sensible Characters will try to find shelter somewhere — even the lee of a rock is better than nothing. Pitching a tent in these conditions requires an <strong>Extended Very Hard (–30) Dexterity</strong> Test with 5 Success Levels required.</p>\n<p>Some foolhardy Characters may refuse to be cowed by a little bad weather, and may insist on pressing on. Skilled Characters are permitted an <strong>Average (+40) Outdoor Survival</strong> Test to know that this is a very bad idea. Water flows down the track in torrents, turning the whole area marshy and requiring a successful <strong>Athletics</strong> Test to move at any speed above walking pace: on an Impressive or worse failure, the unlucky Character also gains the @Condition[Prone] condition.</p>\n<p>Horses grow nervous and unsure of their footing. Riders or drovers must pass a <strong>Difficult (–10) Charm Animal</strong> Test. Failure means the animal spends the next turn rearing, whinnying, and refusing to move. Pack animals have a 5% chance of shedding their load while doing this. On an Impressive or worse failure, the animal attacks any Character who tries to force it to go on.</p>\n<h4>Cold and Wet</h4>\n<p>Characters who fail to take shelter from bad weather end up soaked to the skin and freezing cold. Every 15 minutes that the Characters persist in moving through bad weather, they must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test. Those who fail gain a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition for every –1SL.</p>\n<p>If a Character gets more @Condition[Fatigued] Conditions than their Toughness Bonus in these conditions, they begin to suffer from hypothermia. Every hour until such a Character can warm up and dry out, they must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test. If they fail they lose [[/br 1d10 #Characteristic Loss]] points from each characteristic. </p>\n<p>If any characteristic reaches zero, the character falls unconscious and can only be roused once all characteristics are raised back to 1 point or more. Once a Character is warm and dry, all characteristics return at the rate of [[/br 1d10 #Characteristic Regain]] points per hour, doubled on a successful <strong>Average (+20) Endurance</strong> Test.</p>\n<h3>Hidden Drops</h3>\n<p>Blizzards can cause snow to build up over a crevice, concealing the drop. Unwary Characters, thinking they are on unbroken ground, could easily step on the snow ‘bridge’ which cannot support their weight, taking a nasty fall, or breaking their ankle or leg. Such hazards are difficult to see (a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test) but passing an <strong>Average (+20) Outdoor Survival</strong> Test is enough to know of their existence and avoid them by testing the ground ahead with a stick. If a Character fails to spot the danger and steps in it, they can attempt an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test. Success means the Character grabbed on at the last moment. However, if they fail, they suffer a fall of [[/r D10 #Fall]] yards.</p>\n<h3>Altitude Sickness</h3>\n<p>As they leave the last signs of Imperial civilisation behind and climb towards Karak Skygg, the Characters risk the effects of thinner air. At some point during their ascent you should call for each Human and Halfling Character to test to avoid contracting Altitude Sickness. Ideally, call for the Test after a day of strenuous climbing and travel.</p>\n<p>A Character can successfully recognise the sickness and recall appropriate treatment by passing an <strong>Average (+20) Healing</strong> or <strong>Challenging (+0) Outdoor Survival</strong> Test.</p>\n<p>@Item[UyMo7lizFl5WfvkL]{Altitude Sickness}</p>\n<h3>Landslides</h3>\n<p>You can decide to tease the Characters from time to time with small rocks and pebbles tumbling down on their hats from higher slopes. They may think there are enemies above them, or move and speak very gently for fear of setting off a landslide.</p>\n<p>A landslide could be instigated by a number of things — a bullet or spell could miss its target, or a bungled <strong>Climb</strong> Test could cause a Character to dislodge a rock that was holding up several others. Landslides are extremely dangerous, so provide a way for Characters to escape the worst of it, such as an outcrop to shelter behind, rope tethers to keep them from falling to their deaths, or even just <strong>Climb </strong>or <strong>Athletics </strong>Tests to grab on to a ledge mid-fall.</p>\n<p>A rockfall causes [[/r 1d10 #Rockfall Damage]] damage to every creature in its path, modified by Armour and Toughness Bonus as normal. Characters may make <strong>Challenging (+0) Dodge </strong>Tests to avoid the rocks, but if they suffer an Impressive Failure or worse, they are swept along with the rockfall, falling [[/r 1d10 #Fall]] yards down the mountain, and suffering additional damage as a result.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[j2zcS1PZvay1Z4kz]{Snake!}</h4>\n<p>A @Actor[j2zcS1PZvay1Z4kz]{snake} has crawled out to warm itself on the stones of the trackway. It is well camouflaged, and requires a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception </strong>Test to spot from a distance. An Impressive or worse failure indicates that the Character’s horse spotted the snake first, and rears in fright, requiring a <strong>Challenging (+0) Ride</strong> Test to avoid being thrown from the horse.</p>\n<p>The snake does not attack unless it feels threatened, and slithers away if subjected to missile fire.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[LGYMCEy7z6xUEqv4]{Vengeful Ghost}</h4>\n<p>Hazards such as avalanches and rockfalls have claimed the lives of many incautious and unlucky travellers, and once in a while, a Ghost haunts a particular stretch of the narrow mountain pass. Driven by a distorted memory of its death, it becomes obsessed with driving others to their doom.</p>\n<p>This kind of encounter is most effective in poor light — either towards dusk or in bad weather. At first, the Ghost might seem to be a fellow traveller, either coming toward the party or standing by the roadside; but as the Characters approach, they can see that its body is translucent and its feet do not seem to touch the ground. With a howl, the angry spirit swoops on the Characters, using its @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.pTorrE0l3VybAbtn]{Fear} Trait to try to make them — or their mounts — panic and fall over the edge.</p>\n<p>Should the Ghost manage to inflict a @Condition[Broken] Condition on either a Character or their mount there is a risk that they will stumble and fall. Any Broken Character should make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics </strong>Test. If they pass, they skirt round their companions and retreat back the way they came. If they fail, they suffer a fall of [[/r 2d10 #Fall]] yards.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[Qdheep8q7c9LoWos]{Clan Mange Stragglers}</h4>\n<p>As the Characters approach a cave mouth by the side of the pass, they should make a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test. Those who pass hear sounds of chittering and squeaking emanating from within. A group of wretched Skaven are making their way to Karak Skygg: survivors of the battle at Brass Keep. These five members of Clan Mange have not yet realised that they have been betrayed. They are in a bad state and try to avoid any Man-things, but if the Characters insist on entering the cave they fight like cornered rats.</p>\n<h4>@Actor[FXghHdVHK0i3NTDH]{Young Wyvern}</h4>\n<p>Wyverns may be seen occasionally in the distance, circling high above the mountains as they scan the ground for prey. A juvenile swoops over the mountains near to Karak Skygg, looking for easy pickings. The Characters can spot the Wyvern before it sees them by passing a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> Test. If they wish to hide from the Wyvern, they can do so by passing a <strong>Stealth </strong>Test opposed by its Perception of 15. The Wyvern leaves the area after 15 minutes, but it returns every hour for another patrol.</p>\n<p>If the Characters successfully evade the Wyvern 3 times, they are spared further harassment by none other than @JournalEntry[tyQFVt3aQpjsWLFd]{Maliss Manrack}. There is a tremendous ‘Zzzzappp!’ sound as the Moonbreaker cannon shoots the creature out of the sky.</p>\n<p>If the Wyvern spots the Characters it follows them at a distance of 200 yards. If the party stays together, the wyvern does not attack, but looks for an opportunity to pick off a pack animal — or a Character — who falls behind by more than 30 yards.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/mountains.webp","folder":"wcl7UoecQXn9SThP","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Into the Middle Mountains","sort":200000}}}

Since his near-disastrous brush with a Skaven spellcaster, he tends to keep to the less-frequented areas. However, sometimes his outrage builds to the point where he makes a furious charge, scattering frightened slaves and @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{Clanrats}, retreating before the rats can counterattack to plan his next forray. Gimbrin knows this is a futile task, as the raki are apparently endless and he is but a single Dwarf — and not even a living one at that. However, he stubbornly persists, which is something in which he has had many long years of practice.</p>\n<p>The GM must judge the best moment to introduce Gimbrin. He might take a hand in a fight that is going against the Characters, or he might pop out of a wall when they are hiding or resting somewhere quiet, exhorting them to drive the Skaven out of his hold. If the Characters miss the explosives stowed in the walls (See @JournalEntry[5hlq3xE8w3btQyjP]{The Hidden Arsenal}) then Gimbrin will point it out — he is in fact responsible for having them placed there. Gimbrin choose to remain with the keep after it was abandoned, and was killed in its defence shortly thereafter. The only reason he has not detonated the casks himself is that he still felt the Keep could be saved. Seeing the cope and size of the Skaven infestation has changed his mind, but he was unable to get near the Arsenal without the Characters aid.</p>\n<p>Gimbrin might also appear if the Characters are captured and appear to need proper Dwarf assistance. If they seem to be doing well enough at the task of escaping, he will hang around making unhelpful comments, urging them to hurry up and deal with these cursed ratmen. If they are in genuine trouble because of unlucky dice or lack of ideas, he could help — indirectly. After all, it would be too easy simply to have him cut their bonds with his ethereal axe; he might offer advice — laconic and contemptuous, since they have not impressed him, but genuinely useful since they are the only allies he has.</p>\n<p>Gimbrin’s @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.JIAe7i7dqTQBu4do]{Territorial} Trait restricts him to the inside of the hold, and he becomes @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.D0ImWEIMSDgElsnl]{Unstable} outside it. When the hold is destroyed, his spirit is either shredded in the Warpstone-laced explosion, or laid to rest by the destruction of all the Skaven who had invaded his realm.</p>","folder":"pVeEFFZsj7o6z9yH","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Chance Acquaintances","sort":0}}}

It was here that the Deep Forges burned and the Underway carried swift messengers to other Holds in the Middle Mountains.</p>\n<p>Today, the lowest levels of the Hold are choked with rockfalls and riddled with Skaven tunnels from where the ratmen first broke into Karak Skygg. The tombs were removed wholesale to the World’s Edge Mountains, and the Temple deconsecrated and stripped bare. The Underway is sealed with colossal stone barricades and flooded with a foot of water, while the mines have been blocked with rubble.</p>\n<h4>The Outflow</h4>\n<p>A reinforced tunnel, wide and tall enough for a coach and horses to ride through. This was once the culvert carrying waste from the Hold — runoff from the forges, waste water and sewage. The tunnel opening is in the valley below the mountain, surrounded by a grotesque carved head resembling a goblin and covered with a rusty iron grill with large gaps. A trickle of foul water still flows from the tunnel, sustaining a lush growth of tall reeds. These provide perfect cover for anyone trying to sneak in.</p>\n<p>After navigating the dark, stinking tunnel, the outflow eventually opens in a large drainage chamber with a broken pump. Climbing this leads up into the Pit.</p>\n<h4>The Pit</h4>\n<p>Below the prisons and slave pens is a chamber that was once the cistern, where drinking water would gather and collect, and below that is the outflow. The Skaven have excavated this area, breaking through to the former Halls of Gazul and Temple of Grungni. It is now a huge open chamber supported by massive pillars of cut stone. From holes above, filth and waste is thrown down, including the dead. This pile of rotting organic matter provides fertiliser for Black Corn, a putrid Skaven crop which is grown here to feed the lowest denizens of Karak Skygg. The only light in the Pit comes from the glowing fungus that clings to the walls and roof, and creeps across the crop, bathing everything in a faint blue glow.</p>\n<p>Any adventurers entering the Pit, from the outflow or some other route, must contend with the Skavenslaves who work here gathering the corn, and who are whipped and punished by packmasters if they dare eat the harvest.

The Graf would supply the guards and the prisoners, who would serve a sentence of labour in lieu of death.</p>\n<p>In return, @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegarde} and the Sisters of the Tears of Pity would undertake both to reform these criminals and make the mines profitable. Only the Shallyans saw this arrangement as anything other than a compromise. ‘<em>Give her a year in that wilderness,’</em> the Graf was overheard to say, ‘<em>and she’ll be back, wanting to burn those wretches herself.’</em> The Shallyans succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations, except perhaps those of Sister Hildegarde herself. An able administrator with the ability to reach the most calloused soul, she not only convinced many (including some guards) to give up their sinful ways, but the mine itself was turning a profit by the end of the second year. Middenheimers were stunned to see convicts return after their sentences were up and look for honest jobs, while the city’s @Compendium[wfrp4e-pbtt.pbtt-actors.htCpUSEFBVpiknOx]{Chancellor} couldn’t believe there was so much profit left in the old mines. For over ten years, Sister Hildegarde made her experiment a model for others. When she died, the graceful prison population actually built a statue of her that stands by the chapel in the Square of Hope to this day.</p>\n<p>The von Kärzburdgers were not, however, going to allow such a valuable source of metal and free labour to be controlled by someone else. After @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Sister Hildegarde’s} passing Graf Erich’s son Wilhelm took direct control, putting the @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.bzoTTpyfsrsLTv7y]{Middenheim Miners’ Guild} in charge. The Shallyan chaplains still minister to the needs of the prisoners and try to save their souls, but the convicts’ real role is as unpaid labour for the City of the White Wolf.</p>\n<h3>Location</h3>\n<p>The road to the prison begins about a day’s ride north of Middenheim along the Nordland Road, where the weary traveller will come across a grim intersection. The northbound fork is well-used and leads quickly to the <em>Fox and Crown</em>, an independent coaching inn that prospers from the Middenheim-Salzenmund traffic. Riders heading toward Salzenmund hurry through the intersection and on to the inn, while those travelling south will often delay their journey at the inn until the next morning if dusk is falling. Few want to be caught near the crossroads after dark, for the eastbound road leads to the dreaded Middenheim Mining Colony and Penitentiary.</p>\n<p>Twin granite pylons mark the start of the road, each bearing a pair of manacles and the seals of Middenheim and its Miners’ Guild. From this point, wagon trains carrying shackled prisoners wind for two and a half days through the Forest of Shadows and along the base of the Middle Mountains until they reach a narrow valley set between two ridges. Tall, with sharp peaks and little cover, these ridges curve towards each other, almost meeting at the far end of the valley. Long ago, some sardonic wit named the ridges the ‘Graf ’s embrace’. The grim caravans and their escorts pass through reinforced gates and follow the road to the far end of the valley, where the gap between the ridges is blocked by a keep and a wall. The wagons are unloaded in the Square of Hope in the centre of the barracks and workhouses, beneath the gaze of Sister Hildegarde’s weatherworn statue. Sometimes, they carry back the fortunate few whose time is done: more often than not, they carry back nothing but iron bars.</p>\n<p>The convicts are met by mercenaries in the employ of the Guild’s Resident Master, currently a Dwarf named Yarrik. The duty sergeant reads the rules to newly arrived prisoners, making sure they know in grim detail the punishments meted out for any infraction or rebellion. His monologue is punctuated by the hammering of the blacksmith as he fits a heavier set of shackles to each new arrival. Once the blacksmith is finished, the guards lead the prisoners to the barracks, where each is assigned a bunk and a bucket. The next morning, before dawn, a meal of thin porridge is alI they get before being led into the mines for the first of many long days, marching under a faded sign that reads ‘Honest work makes an honest man.’</p>\n<p>Work in the mines is hard and cramped, with few tunnels high enough for a man to stand in, and shifts lasting for 14 hours. Tools are dull and inadequate because the guards fear giving the prisoners anything that they could turn into a weapon. They have little to be afraid of, though, for the men are almost always too exhausted to do more than work, eat and sleep. One afternoon in 16 is considered ‘free time’ for trusted inmates, most of whom spend the time praying in the Shallyan chapel.</p>\n<h3>A Deadly Secret</h3>\n<p>Founded in hope, the penitentiary has now become a grim place where most inmates just try to survive until their sentences run out, or for those condemned for life, as long as they can. Still, there are a few with unbroken spirits who try to resist. Until recently, the camp overseers dealt with such troublemakers by working them until they broke or gave the guards a reason to kill them, but Resident Master Yarrik has found a better way. Big, strong prisoners, who look like they have wit and spirit to match their brawn, are illegally sold to pit fighter managers who travel the back roads of the Old World.</p>\n<p>Each caravan travelling to the mining colony has an undercover contact riding with it. When alerted of a likely candidate by Yarrik’s cronies, the contact passes a message to a middleman at the Fox and Crown, who in turn sends notice to a ‘merchant’ in Salzenmund. At the penitentiary, another unfortunate death is recorded, usually ascribed to a mining accident or a brawl.</p>\n<p>The parties involved are discreet enough that few notice the lone covered wagons heading east from the crossroads, and no one has yet made the connection between, for example, a pit fighter with his tongue cut out in Bretonnia and a recently deceased Middenheim racketeer. The gold lining Yarrik’s pockets keeps him warm through the cold northern nights.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/karzburdger-estate.webp","folder":"JTeIyCtQuF0ycF4v","sort":150000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"A Guide to the Middle Mountains","sort":150000}}}

But Maliss was frustrated by Morrslieb’s unpredictability,  and even after stealing more astronomical research, could not forecast a moment when the moon would be above Karak Skygg. He had a breakthrough when he coerced a kidnapped Astromancer to use their expertise to give him an answer. Deputy High Wizard @Actor[ZVVaOEUN9ArYrYnM]{Janna Eberhaeur} has unknowingly provided the last piece of research for Maliss — and she’s about to outlive her usefulness.</p>\n<p>The Moonbreaker Cannon is a humongous device which channels the raw power of refined Warpstone to generate bolts of Warp lightning.

There is still work to be done completing construction of the cannon and refining sufficient Warpfuel, so he wants the whole place to work faster and harder. When Morrslieb reaches a fixed point in the night sky, the bell tolls 13 times, and the cannon has a narrow interval to fire its volley. The intervals between tolls are as irregular as Morrslieb’s trajectory is chaotic, so the whole of Karak Skygg is on tenterhooks, unsure when the bell will ring next.</em></p>\n<p><em>The great thing about Morrslieb’s unpredictability is that you can make the bell toll whenever you want to pick up the pace — use the tolling bell to spur the Players along. The first time they hear it, the party will just hear one chime, but on the second and third they’ll understand that it’s counting up. If they talk with any Skaven or Yellow Fang cultist, they can explain that 13 is the sacred number of the Horned Rat. </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\n<p>There are three effective ways for the party to prevent Maliss’s scheme and save the Empire from catastrophe.</p>\n<p><strong>Target Maliss</strong> — by sneaking through Karak Skygg and evading capture, the party could reach the Warlock Engineer’s laboratory and kill him before the Moonbreaker Cannon is fired. This is perhaps the most straightforward solution, although they’ll need to evade capture, and it leaves the problem of a mountain full of Skaven and a deadly cannon.</p>\n<p><strong>Slave revolt</strong> — Many Clan Mange mercenaries were wiped out at Brass Keep, with the remainder now enslaved in Karak Skygg. But the sadistic Maliss kept the Clan Mange Warlord alive to witness the fate of his clanmates. If the party free @Actor[322W7XoWqKEy7kWk]{Warlord Kratz} and explain what happened at Brass Keep and under Middenheim, the general may set aside his suspicion of man-things and whip up a desperate rebellion. The Skavenslaves vastly outnumber Clan Skryre, and may be able to overwhelm them, especially if the party lends a hand by freeing enough captives.</p>\n<p><strong>Sabotage </strong>— the Moonbreaker Cannon is an intricate device which must be fired at a very specific time — and it’s still not quite finished. If the party delays completion, tampers with the refined Warpstone or interferes with the workings, they could prevent the cannon firing on Morrslieb, or cause it to malfunction and explode. The Skaven spy @Actor[B0rOVyG0wgVoVA6z]{Brokenclaw} could be their unlikely ally in this or traitor engineer @Actor[A0xZ7cdmHmr6LA9X]{Hermann von Talg} may also unwittingly help direct their wrecking efforts.</p>","folder":"AB2bLgqo3QiAniTe","sort":-250000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Karak Skygg","sort":-250000}}}

Spreaders of malicious gossip, fear mongers, and panic-causers, for certain, attract his ire. </p>\n<p>The Characters might be paid an unfriendly visit by Gaffel and his men, should word get to him that they are encouraging citizens on his patch to believe that the Skaven myth is real. Perhaps he is aware that they are allies of @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Professor Hasche} (whom he despises), or they have talked to the wrong person about their experiences with the Skaven, and they have been reported as troublemakers to the Watch Captain. </p>\n<p>Gaffel will be intent on ensuring that the Characters shut their mouths. His duty is to make sure the streets are not panicked by idle rumours. He is not the sort of person who asks politely, but will attempt to arrest the Characters for sedition. Woe betide them if they attempt to resist — they will earn a life-long enemy in him. A night in the cells will be a sleepless one, as Gaffel insists on being present to force the Characters to accept that Skaven do not exist. If the Characters can convince him that he has illuminated them, he will release them with a fine. However, if they cross his path again, and he finds out that they still believe that ratmen roam the shadows, woe betide them!  </p>\n<p>@Actor[O9O5o4EwERgFjWCY]{Heimrad Gaffel}</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-weapons.webp\" width=\"193\" height=\"250\" /></div>\n<h4>The City’s Secrets</h4>\n<p>If the Characters have been snooping around in Middenheim’s shadows, they might stir up unwelcome attention from its criminal denizens. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.RxiiV4ppXNCUyh37]{Low Kings of Middenheim} — the leaders of the various criminal gangs and factions that profit from organised thievery, smuggling or assassination – like to keep themselves and their agendas hidden, and anyone unearthing their nefarious enterprises is likely to suffer a serious ‘accident’ to ensure their silence. </p>\n<p>Members of the Yellow Fang keep surreptitious contacts among the criminal underworld who they utilise to carry out the plans of the Skaven masters — of course, the criminals have no idea who they are running errands for, and prefer not to know. The Low Kings do not do anything for nothing, and only ally with Yellow Fang cultists, who can themselves provide a service or a profit. So if the Characters kill a member of the Yellow Fang, they might unwittingly have destroyed the profitable contact of a crime lord, who reacts against the Characters accordingly. </p>\n<p>Thugs and racketeers may warn the Characters off, or even try to waylay isolated members of the party (use the profiles given in for @Actor[cGkOlnBTPyJ65tmg]{Thugs}). However, the Low Kings may realise that there could be a much more profitable way to cause trouble for the Characters. Adventurers are well known for travelling around flashing cash and prized items found during their quests. So @Actor[Tf3p5t1sa7U4ldNN]{Hissing Heinrich}, one of Middenheim’s finest burglars, is despatched to follow them about and acquire as much of their treasure as possible. He may even abscond with handouts and other useful clues.</p>\n<p>@Actor[Tf3p5t1sa7U4ldNN]{Hissing Heinrich}</p>\n<h4>Shadows in the Dark</h4>\n<p>If the Characters begin to make their activities known to the Yellow Fang, but do not yet pose a very significant threat to them, cult agents might try to curb their investigations through subtle means. Killing the Characters at this stage might bring unwanted attention should the would-be assassin fall alive into the hands of the law, or should the authorities seek to investigate any attempt at murder. </p>\n<p>A small cell of Yellow Fang agents of the lowest order are employed for the task — thugs and ne’er-do-wells who know nothing of the grander schemes of their cult but follow the orders of their direct superior. Should the Characters, or anyone else, catch them, they offer very little information apart from a shadowy description of their cells’ cult contact, who keeps their identity a carefully guarded secret from those they order about. </p>\n<p>These agents are at first told to shadow the Characters, to find out who they talk to, where they go, what their habits are — any information that can be used to manipulate them. Whether an agent successfully accomplishes this is governed by the agent’s competence and the Characters’ diligence.  Characters passing a Perception Check opposed by the Agents’ Stealth may spot these folks tailing them.</p>\n<p>If the Characters are observed committing a criminal act, the agents will report this to their contact, who then orders them to blackmail the Characters to force them to desist their investigations. Alternatively, a situation can be contrived by the agents where the Characters are tricked into apparent criminal behaviour, with the same consequences of blackmail. </p>\n<p>If the Characters are observed to maintain close contact with an enemy of the Yellow Fang, such as @Actor[gGLIMaBhne9pMPBj]{Professor Hasche}, the agents might be given the task to smear their reputation with that person, to sour that friendship. The agents themselves might be tasked with engineering a fake friendship with the Characters, winning their trust and offering their help, only to mislead and confound them at every turn. The cultists will do whatever it takes to steer the Characters’ attention away from the scheming of the Yellow Fang network, short of murder — for now.</p>\n<p>@Actor[iFMStgNCPokDRQ5D]{Yellow Fang Spy}</p>\n<h4>A Blade in the Back</h4>\n<p>If the Characters continue to confound the Yellow Fang’s best attempts to divert them, and are getting closer to thwarting the cult’s schemes, or bringing them to light, the Yellow Fang will be forced to undertake more extreme measures. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/items/knife.webp\" width=\"267\" height=\"41\" /></div>\n<p>@Actor[gmHi3iDFL7RaYje2]{Jannick Warsteiner}, a trusted and competent agent, is despatched with orders to track down and murder the Characters. If the Characters’ overall fighting capabilities are known by the Yellow Fang to be strong, they will give Warsteiner their permission to hire hoodlums to help him ambush them, otherwise he’ll try to pick them off in their sleep, preferably one by one. </p>\n<p>If @Actor[gmHi3iDFL7RaYje2]{Warsteiner} is obliged to resort to hired help (he prefers to act alone), he chooses men who’ll do the job no questions asked. Minions do not know anything about the man who hired them. Should Warsteiner himself be captured, he’ll bide his time, waiting for a way of escape, pretending to be a mere hitman hired by the Low King known as @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.gy8z3RbyyEKaoJ2e]{Bleyden}. If the questioning gets too rough, he’ll bite off his own tongue to avoid talking, then seek a quick death.</p>\n<p>Warsteiner is a short, wiry young man, with close cropped hair, clean-shaven and lantern-jawed. He wears dark, well-cut clothes, and is always immaculately presented, especially when presenting himself to a ‘client’. An expert in dagger-work, stealth and caution is his byword when in action. He’ll stalk a victim until an opportunity presents itself for a clean, calm kill and an easy escape. </p>\n<p>@Actor[gmHi3iDFL7RaYje2]{Jannick Warsteiner}</p>\n<h4>Refugees</h4>\n<p>This encounter can take place in Middenheim or on the outskirts. </p>\n<p>A crowd of refugees shuffles towards the Characters, blocking their path. The refugees are victims of the instability plaguing the lands surrounding Middenheim. Perhaps their village was razed during a private war between local nobles, or between Sigmarite and Ulrican factions, or they are folk who have settled in the north from elsewhere in the Empire, driven out by force by Nordlanders agitating for self-rule. The horrific fact that should be made evident to the Characters is that this suffering was not caused by creatures such as Orcs or Beastmen, but by antagonistic factions within the Empire. </p>\n<p>The group consists of about two dozen miserable souls — women, children, old folk, and a scattering of injured young men, all dressed in drab, ragged clothes. Their faces are drawn with hunger, their eyes hollow. Many have bare feet, the others shod with worn footwear — all limp on forwards despite their evident pain and weakness, as though determined to make as much distance as they can from whatever horrors they’ve left behind them.</p>\n<p>On closer inspection, the refugees are from all walks of life. The attire of a few of the women and elderly folk denote their status as minor nobility, though their clothes are as torn and filth-encrusted as those of the peasants with whom they rub shoulders. An old scholar staggers among the crowd, his spectacles broken, clutching a leather-bound book burned round the edges.</p>\n<p>A young woman helps a soldier stagger along, his breastplate pierced in many places, a vicious wound scarring one side of his face. A priest of Taal with thinning hair and brown robes, wanders along in a daze, eyes half closed, muttering supplications to his god, arms raised as if in prayer. Bloody bandages are wrapped around the stumps where his hands should be. </p>\n<p>If this scene takes place on the streets of Middenheim, or in an outlying town or village, the reaction of passers-by is almost invariably the same — people shy away from the refugees with expressions of terror as though fearful that these unfortunates will attract the calamity they have escaped. A few individuals seek to engage the refugees — a priestess of Shallya offers prayers, a compassionate baker brings bread to ease their obvious hunger, or a crazed flagellant approaches them, and begins whipping them, extolling their deliverance from sin with pain. A band of street urchins might dart amongst the refugees, pilfering their few pitiful possessions. </p>\n<p>The Character may want to come to the aid of those who are trying to alleviate the sufferings of the crowd, or stop those causing them harm. </p>\n<p>Eventually, the refugees are rounded up by the forces of law and order within the vicinity. The Characters might be involved in discussions on what to do with them, especially if the captain of the watch or local militia wants to wash his hands of these people and move them on elsewhere — let them be someone else’s problem; there are too many new mouths to feed… </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/reavers.webp\" /></div>\n<h4>Scourge-Riders</h4>\n<p>The political instability also affects the areas surrounding Middenheim. The following event can take place whenever the Characters are travelling beyond the city gates. </p>\n<p>A pall of smoke attracts the Characters to a burning village. If they help put out the flames, the grateful villagers tell them that their village was targeted by a band of mounted men in the blue and yellow uniforms of Nordland state troops. They arrived without warning, and set about with fire and destruction. The Characters can follow their trail to another village, and intervene before the horsemen can inflict too much damage. If the Characters get into trouble, a contingent of Road Wardens rides to their rescue. </p>\n<p>In fact, the raiders are mercenaries from the Border Princes, the self-styled @Actor[9mh4uluDmKuXCNnI]{Scourge-Riders} led by one Lobar Zumborski, a Kislevite exile, a vicious killer who delights in atrocity. They have been hired by a wealthy woman in Salzenmund who provided their clothing. If the Characters capture one of the riders, he gives the following justification for their actions.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<p>‘We were hired by the agent of this fine fellow called Gausser, proper gentleman he is. He’s paid to show Middenheim’s Graf what for if he doesn’t respect the rights of Nordlanders to rule for themselves. So we’re here to give the Todbringers a bloody nose. Death to the rotten Graf of Middenheim! Death to his lackeys the lickspittle Nikses! Long live Count Gausser and a free Nordland!’ </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The riders have been paid extra to divulge this information if they were captured, and for all they know it is true. In fact, their patron is a secret agent of the Altdorf cell of the Purple Hand, tasked to spread destruction among the villages that provide Middenheim with its vital food supply, and to exacerbate tensions between the provinces. </p>\n<p>If a captured scourge rider is asked about the identity of Gausser’s agent, they do not know; but if asked if Gausser’s agent wore purple clothing they say, <em>‘she had a very fine mauve hat on her’.</em></p>\n<p>@Actor[9mh4uluDmKuXCNnI]{Scourge Rider}</p>\n<h4>From the Gutter</h4>\n<p>If the Characters continue to frustrate the Yellow Fang’s plans, and the cult’s indirect and direct action fails to faze them, the cultists’ Skaven masters might decide to seize the initiative themselves. </p>\n<p>The ratmen will not confront the Characters directly — if anything goes wrong, they risk revealing their presence to the upper world. Their aim is to discover how much the Characters know about their existence, and to engineer a fatal ‘accident’ — if they decide the Characters pose too much of a risk. </p>\n<p>Their first action will be to tail the Characters, discover where they are based, and break into their rooms and rifle through their belongings, stealing any items incriminating to Skaven existence. The Gutter Runners tasked with this mission leave virtually no clues behind, though a sharp-eyed Character might spot a trace of a paw print that resembles that of a man-sized rat to an imaginative onlooker (it’s certainly not decisive evidence). </p>\n<p>If the Skaven decide that the Characters pose a significant threat to their plans, they’ll try to dispose of them sneakily. The Characters might experience a flurry of ‘accidents’, each increasingly more devastating and indiscriminate than the last,  for example: a collapsing wall; a runaway horse and cart; a sinkhole swallowing the street due to a collapsing sewer work; an exploding building apparently caused by a build-up of gas in an underground drainage system. </p>\n<p>The Characters should escape these events by the skin of their teeth, or with minor injuries. Worse will be the effects on those around the Characters — the innocents caught up by the devastation. No doubt the Characters will want to go to the help of the injured, or rescue those endangered by the carnage. </p>\n<p>Such accidents occur whenever the Characters spend more than two nights in a row in the same location, they might earn a grim reputation as accursed individuals, and people familiar with them might get nervous at their approach…</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/items/skaven-equipment.webp\" width=\"270\" height=\"258\" /></div>\n<h4>Mantrappers</h4>\n<p>The Characters may also fall foul of the Skaven while travelling the wilds alone. Clan Mange is constantly on the prowl for slaves. It prefers to prey on Middenheim’s weak and vulnerable, the destitute and forgotten souls who will not be missed by society. But should the watch patrols strengthen due to rising disturbances within the city, the clan might be forced to widen its range to encompass the settlements and roadways beyond the city walls. </p>\n<p>A Clan Mange kidnapping attempt will take place in a remote area in terrain suited for their purposes. They tend to choose isolated stretches of road with soft cover (such as bushes) to one side and hard cover (such as rocks) on the other. They bury their @Item[NTK53nLy10bZrjgQ]{mantraps} around the rocks and hide in the bushes. When a small group of travellers pass by the mantrappers open their ambush with a hail of bullets from the bushes. Those targets who remain in open are soon subdued by the slingshots, and those who seek cover incapacitated by the mantraps.</p>\n<p>If the Skaven have underestimated their intended prey, and the Characters stand their ground, the ratmen slink away into the wilderness. There will be other, easier targets, and it is not worth their while risking their lives unnecessarily or revealing their existence. </p>\n<p>If the Characters are unlucky and find themselves all trapped, they should be rescued at the last minute by the chance arrival of Road Wardens. The Skaven prefer to escape, leaving their victims behind, sooner than face any sort of determined resistance from well-armed opponents. There will be no indication of any Skaven presence by the time the horsemen have appraised the situation, and the Characters’ protestations that they have been victimised by ratmen will be met with ridicule and scorn. </p>\n<p>@Actor[7m85tjWQXzU1wD7G]{Clan Mange Slave Master}</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-skaven-shield2.webp\" width=\"225\" height=\"214\" /></div>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/reavers.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Encounters","sort":0}}}

In recent weeks, two miners have gone missing in the tunnels and now the other miners are too scared to work. A menacing @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror} has made its lair within the mine following the deaths of its @JournalEntry[GDJrTdC0a8HHqyr8]{Clan Moulder} handlers. </p>\n<p>There are three ways to get the Characters involved. They could be passing through the village for some reason, in which case the mayor of the village, Johann Mulderbrek, approaches them and tries to hire their help. Alternatively, Johann may approach them in a tavern in a larger town, offering to pay for their assistance. This may be easier, since it avoids Character worries about getting to places on time if they are just passing through. Johann approaches the Characters rather than the authorities because the miners at Oberholzbek have not paid full due taxes on their silver for some years (having declared a lower income than they actually obtained), so he is extremely reluctant to have officials — even militia — anywhere near the place. </p>\n<p>The third way is for Johann to have voiced concerns to the authorities in Middenheim about goings-on at the mine during <strong>The Horned Rat</strong>. In this case, the Characters can be asked to investigate Oberholzbek whilst they deal with the series of similar events after their audience with the Graf.</p>\n<h3>Briefing for the Characters </h3>\n<p>Johann’s story is simple. He is the mayor of a village called Oberholzbek. The sole source of income for the villagers is a small silver mine. The yield is meagre, but it is just enough to get by on. However, two men have recently disappeared in the mine. Axel Muller vanished 19 days before the Characters meet Johann, and Kurt Zondervan vanished 8 days ago. They were alone, doing maintenance work, when they vanished. No trace of their bodies has been found, but some of their equipment was recovered, littered over some distance. </p>\n<p>Noises have also been heard recently, coming from the deepest recesses of the mine. The villagers are now terrified and dare not enter. They are desperate, since they have no other source of income, and if the mines are not maintained they may fall into disrepair and become unworkable. The Characters cannot delay if they are going to help. Johann offers each Character @Pay[3gc EACH]{3 GC} if they locate and slay the creatures that killed or captured Axel and Kurt. If the Characters make a successful opposed <strong>Haggle </strong>Test (Johann’s Haggle score is 42), the mayor can be pushed up to 5 GC each, but the village cannot afford to pay more. If the Characters are prepared to help, Johann and the other villagers are prepared to give them all normal supplies, and also provide the two @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.JX4Qy1qVog3PZBvA]{Davrich Lamps} they have. </p>\n<h3>OBERHOLZBEK</h3>\n<p>The mining community consists of 36 adult occupants, most of whom are miners. No map of the village is given here, since it is not needed in play. There are no notable buildings and the average house is a modest affair. There is one tavern with a common room called the <em>Pit Prop</em>, which has a small stable beside it, and a smithy, which doubles as a trading store. There is no priest and no militia in the village. </p>\n<p>Lukas Schultz runs the <em>Pit Prop</em> with his barmaid Gretchen; both are surly sorts, but honest. Josef Hartmann is a jack-of-all-trades who owns the smithy; he can forge iron (and makes simple items for use in mining), shoe a horse, construct a fair wagon, and suchlike. He and Johann take care of the maintenance of the mines, with Kurt and Axel’s help. @Actor[rr95rETxpF7xzivq]{Wilhelm Koch} and @Actor[t9iXKA9Bw6UJvpdB]{Martina Kurtz} are special cases, and are dealt with below.</p>\n<h3>Village Enquiries </h3>\n<p>If the Characters make no attempt to ask questions of the villagers, hold them up for a little time while Johann gets the equipment they may need. As they wait, anxious villagers badger the Characters with questions and introduce some of the information here. </p>\n<p>If the Characters enquire, make it clear the villagers do not have much money and that they cannot afford more lost mining time — get their desperation across. A sanguine villager could say something like: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘We all hope one day we’ll find the big one, the vein of pure silver — but it’s been scavengings only for as long as anyone can remember, and the big one is just a dream.’ </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Greedy Characters may consider taking the village over and running the mine themselves. If they try this, the best way to deal with the situation is to let them seem to get away with it. Then, while the Characters are still resident, Imperial tax collectors arrive, with well-armed escorts, having discovered the villagers’ falsified tax payments. They inevitably hold the party responsible. </p>\n<p>If the Characters ask about the missing villagers, they discover only that there was nothing unusual about the men, nor about the time of their disappearances. Axel was a married man of 35, Kurt a youth of 17. Axel was a drunken lout, while Kurt was a solitary, introverted, and spotty youth. Axel’s wife Etelka is still in mourning after the death of her husband, despite his unpleasantness, and can give the Characters no useful information. @Scene[xVhgwauxF2EH99B8]{Lower Tunnels} shows the areas where the miners’ gear was found, if the Characters ask for this (irrelevant) detail. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/misc/spot-candle.webp\" width=\"170\" height=\"196\" /></div>\n<h4>Mapping the Mines </h4>\n<p>Johann does have a map of the mines and is bound to offer it to the party. @Scene[xVhgwauxF2EH99B8]{Lower Tunnels} is the GM’s map of the mines, showing the @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror’s} tunnels as well as the worked passages within the mine. The map Johann gives the Characters only shows the latter. The mines are safe enough, although small pockets of gas build up in places from time to time. It’s harmless to breathe this gas but it is flammable, making the careful use of @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.JX4Qy1qVog3PZBvA]{Davrich Lamps} essential. See @JournalEntry[vgQPae9Z1SH61shO]{Down in the Mines} for more information. </p>\n<h4>Village Threats</h4>\n<p>Bandits have not tried to raid the village in years — the money is not worth it. Hence there is little need for a militia. Orcs have been sighted nearby recently, and this has sparked significant concern, but Baron Holzbek has been too busy trying to suppress the Blackweb Forest Goblins to the south to despatch troops to drive the Orcs back. The working folk of the village have leather jacks and can use pickaxe handles to good effect, if need be. </p>\n<p>There are two important NPCs whose information may help and intrigue the Characters, and these are now dealt with. </p>\n<h4>@Actor[rr95rETxpF7xzivq]{Wilhelm Koch}</h4>\n<p>Wilhelm imposes himself upon the Characters at any time, as you see fit. He suffers from a form of paranoia, and while he sounds rational to begin with, he slowly slips into deluded monomania. He believes the end of the world is at hand, and that the creature in the mines is a monstrous Daemon called Frau Jägerin who has an insatiable thirst for human blood. After introducing Koch as quite sensible and soft-spoken, begin to slowly emphasise his unhinged state.</p>\n<p>If any Character listening to this hypothesis manages to avoid laughing at @Actor[rr95rETxpF7xzivq]{Koch}, he imparts the one useful piece of information he does have. This is not the first time something has appeared down in the mine. Fifty years ago, a wizard had been down the mine, searching for something. Koch asserts that she summoned the Daemon to the mines, and he believes that now another wizard must have summoned Frau Jägerin again. He openly suspects any obvious magic-using Characters. </p>\n<p>This is mostly nonsense, of course, but it does contain a germ of truth. The important thing is to try to get the Characters interested that a wizard may be involved. If they ask around, other villagers may remember something about a visiting wizard, but no one knows what she may have been searching for. </p>\n<p>If the Characters ask @Actor[rr95rETxpF7xzivq]{Wilhelm} more about the missing wizard, he becomes tight-lipped and protective. However, if they insist on getting more from him and pass a <strong>Difficult (–10) Charm</strong> Test, he fetches a piece of old vellum from his cottage. The sheet is stained by long years of handling, and the writing on it is hard to make out in places and utterly obliterated in others.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/handouts/handout10.webp\" width=\"282\" height=\"260\" /></div>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[0HKj7INtJAS0A05n]{Handout 10}</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘… from the blasted city of Mordheim… it was then I realised that my unfortunate apprentice could be thought of as human no longer … about the size of an Ogre’s clenched fist, precious to the right customer … a cave beneath the roots of the western Middle Mountains near the source of the Kleiflusch …’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@Actor[rr95rETxpF7xzivq]{Wilhelm} says he found the parchment following the disappearance of the wizard. Oberholzbek is indeed in the foothills of the Middle Mountains, close to the source of the Kleiflusch.</p>\n<p>@Actor[t9iXKA9Bw6UJvpdB]{Martina Kurtz}, Mine Foreman </p>\n<p>Martina has a guilty secret of sorts. A month ago, she was approached by a man called Karlinsel Spedklingeln, a wizard travelling with his warrior henchman, who asked Kurtz to show them the layout of the mine, paying him 3 GC for the information. These two had failed in their attempts to get Johann to let them into the mines (see <strong>Getting Equipped</strong>, below). Karlinsel Spedklingeln said that he was searching for a lost magical treasure in the mine, but if Martina spoke of this to anyone, she would be very sorry afterwards. Martina showed them Johann’s map, and went down with them on two evenings, after normal working hours. They went alone a third time, and never came back. Martina has no idea what happened to them, but Axel disappeared soon afterwards. </p>\n<p>@Actor[t9iXKA9Bw6UJvpdB]{Martina} knows about @Actor[rr95rETxpF7xzivq]{Wilhelm Koch’s} rantings. Although she never took them seriously in the past, she is afraid that the wizard he took down the mine did indeed summon a Daemon, which is now devouring villagers. Martina is even more afraid that someone may find out what she has done. </p>\n<p>Obviously, he is not going to release this information to the Characters easily. Although his information should be made available, the Characters must approach him carefully to learn what he knows. </p>\n<p>On first contact, allow the Characters a <strong>Difficult (–10) Intuition</strong> Test to detect that @Actor[t9iXKA9Bw6UJvpdB]{Martina}is tense and nervous, even by comparison with other villagers. To arouse Character suspicions further, Martina hangs around the Characters often. He is torn between conflicting drives, fearing that the Characters may learn of what he has done but also desperately hoping that they can fix the terrible mess he thinks he has caused. </p>\n<p>You may decide that if and when the Characters go to consult Johann’s map, they find it missing. Johann knows that Martina is the only person who has access to it. (In fact, Martina did borrow it and has forgotten to return it.) This worries Johann, and he arranges a thorough interrogation of @Actor[t9iXKA9Bw6UJvpdB]{Martina} in the <em>Pit Prop</em>. If the Characters get Martina drunk, she might let something slip, or even confess her story to a sympathetic Character who promises not to tell Johann or to let other villagers know. To do this, the Characters must match Martina for drinks and she must fail at least two Consume Alcohol Tests. If she confesses to them, and they shop him to Johann, angry villagers run Martina out of town.</p>\n<h3>Getting Equipped </h3>\n<p>The Characters probably need wooden poles, ropes,and similar equipment, which the villagers are happy to lend. Weapons are another matter; the Characters should have their own, and the villagers have only a handful of ordinary maces, bows, and pickaxes between them, in addition to a few knives and daggers. The miners don’t use songbirds to search for gaseous dangers in the tunnels — they are unaware of the trick — and blackdamp is not present in lethal concentrations. Characters who pass a <strong>Hard (–20) Trade (Miner) </strong>or <strong>Lore (Geology) </strong>Test know of the trick, but acquiring a bird would be quite difficult. Requests for other common items such as roughspun sacks or face coverings are granted. </p>\n<p>The most important items are lamps. Because of the odd gas pocket and the fact the mines are unlit, lanterns are essential. The villagers are happy to loan each character a simple lamp. @Actor[t9iXKA9Bw6UJvpdB]{Martina} and Johann possess @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.trappings.JX4Qy1qVog3PZBvA]{Davrich Lamps}, and whilst they are willing to lend these to the Characters, they are precious items that must be returned.</p>\n<p>One vial of oil keeps a lantern burning for 4 hours at full brightness, or 8 hours with the strength of a candle. Make sure you keep note of how many vials of oil the Characters take and how much they consume. Impose sensible limits on how many vials each Character can carry, depending on what other supplies they have. If a Character insists on carrying some ridiculous number of vials of oil, impose penalties to Movement rate, Initiative, and Agility as you see fit. </p>\n<h3>The Horror in the Mines </h3>\n<p>The creature in the mines is a @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror}, a bloated giant rat of monstrous proportions bred for war by @JournalEntry[GDJrTdC0a8HHqyr8]{Clan Moulder}. The creature’s handlers were transporting it to @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.YVXiBNy42vmgHsI5]{Under-Middenheim} on the orders of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.iIRMNhKXPYVwkjHD]{Master Moulder Skree}. @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-actors.unVj7oRQCYswID6V]{Castellan-Warlord Gnawretch Skrray}, whilst publicly approving the addition of a Brood Horror to Under-Middenheim’s arsenal, privately feared that such a beast would tip the balance of power too greatly in Clan Moulder’s favour. He sent a scouting party to intercept and slay the Packmasters as they transported the Brood Horror.</p>\n<p>The creature ran wild and burrowed into the rock and soil, emerging into a chamber underneath the mines. From here it tunnelled out into the passages at large. It has eaten the missing men, the wizard and his henchman into the bargain. </p>\n<p>The @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror} made its way to the chamber because it was attracted by the presence of a large shard of Warpstone. A warlock and his apprentices had hidden the warpstone there in 2000 IC. Then fifty years ago a wizard arrived, chasing rumours of the hidden stone. She ventured into the mines, tried to teleport into the chamber, but died as the result of a magical mishap. More recently, Karlinsel Spedklingeln and his companion entered the mine, and they were consumed by the Brood Horror.</p>\n<p>The Characters are unlikely to know or discover any of this, of course, but they should probably realise that the appearance of a wizard in the mines seems to be associated with the appearance of a ravenous monster. Wizards among the Characters would be wise to fear the mines.</p>\n<p>Any Character with @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} who goes near the mine and passes a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test senses the presence of <em>Dhar</em>. If that Character is familiar with Warpstone, they feel the swirling <em>Dhar </em>leaching from the mine is consistent with Warpstone. The Brood Horror remains close to the corrupted stone, from which it derives a sense of familiarity and comfort.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/handouts/mine-map.webp\" /></div>","folder":"paL9BPwvstPNo5rx","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Horror in the Darkness","sort":100000}}}

{"_id":"vgQPae9Z1SH61shO","name":"Down in the Mines","content":"<p>The mines are pitch-black and the air is dank and musty. Dripping water can be heard in the distance, there are faint, occasional sounds of wood creaking, and noises echo loudly. The tunnel walls have wet patches, small outcrops of moss and lichens, and the floors are sometimes uneven and rocky. @Scene[xVhgwauxF2EH99B8]{Lower Tunnels} shows some specific details in individual areas. </p>\n<p>The @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror’s} tunnels are rock-strewn and irregular, although they are always wide enough for two Characters to walk side by side. In these tunnels, which are marked separately on @Scene[xVhgwauxF2EH99B8]{Lower Tunnels}. It will be very clear to the Characters where the mine passages end and Brood Horror tunnels begin, even if they don’t have Johann’s map. Describe the junction points clearly to them: <em>‘It looks as if something has tunnelled through here; there are rock chunks all over the floor and no supports’, </em>and so on<em>. </em></p>\n<h4>Gas Pockets </h4>\n<p>@Scene[xVhgwauxF2EH99B8]{Lower Tunnels} shows which areas have significant concentrations of gas in them. You may change these around on different days, should the Characters spend several days in the mines.</p>\n<p>A smell like rotten eggs indicates the presence of the highly flammable firedamp, the most feared of all underground gases. Characters must pass a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test to smell the gas before it is too late. The gas pocket occupies the full width of the passage. </p>\n<p>The chance of an explosion is a cumulative [[/br 1d100 # Explosion Chance]]{5%} for every yard a Character travels through the gas pocket with a naked flame. </p>\n<p>If an explosion occurs, the gas ignites with a flash and a bang. Each Character loses [[/r 1d10 # Damage]] Wounds, modified by Armour Points and Toughness Bonus, and must succeed a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance </strong>Test or gain the @Condition[Prone] Condition. Additionally, all Characters gain Toughness Bonus – SL @Condition[Deafened] and @Condition[Stunned] Conditions and 1 @Condition[Ablaze] Condition.</p>\n<p>There is also a chance that an explosion triggers a cave-in (see below). </p>\n<p>The gas is also slightly deleterious to the senses. It does not affect Characters immediately. However, after 8 hours in the mines, Characters suffer a –10 penalty to all Agility-based Tests. The villagers are habituated to the gas, and this effect does not influence them much during a normal working shift. The villagers do not mention the gas’s effects on the senses, unless the Characters specifically ask about hazards. Typically, this penalty fades after the Character has spent two hours in the fresh air. Any technique that could be used to remove a @Condition[Poisoned] Condition can be used to help someone recover from the gas. </p>\n<h4>Cave-ins </h4>\n<p>The mines have not been maintained for a week and the odd pit prop is sagging a little, there are pools of water on the floor caused by slow leaks from above, and ominous creaking noises  can be heard. The chance of a cave-in is [[/br 1d100 # Cave In Chance]]{10%} per 12-hour period. When one does occur, it takes place at a random point in the mine. Typically, a section of wall has caved in, leaving the ceiling mostly intact. All in the area must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics </strong>Test. Those who fail the Test are hit on the head by falling rocks, taking [[/r 5 # Damage]] Damage that can be reduced by Toughness Bonus and any armour worn on the head.</p>\n<p>The rubble fills an area equal to 3 square yards and requires [[/br 1d10 # Hours]] hours of work to clear. The total time needed is reduced by 1 hour (to a minimum of 1 hour) for each additional Character working to clear the blockage. </p>\n<p>In rarer cases, the ceiling of the mine may give way, causing a stretch of passage [[/br 2d10 #Yards]] yards long to become completely blocked. If the Characters are caught in a cave-in, all in the area must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Athletics </strong>Test. Those who fail take [[/r 7 # Damage]] Damage that can be reduced by Toughness Bonus and any armour worn on the head, and must then succeed on an <strong>Average (+20) Strength </strong>Test to pull themselves out of the rubble. Characters may attempt this Test once per round. Clearing a completely blocked passage requires [[/br 2d10 #Hours]] hours of work per 3 square yards, with the total time needed being reduced by 2 hours (to a minimum of 1 hour) for each additional Character working to clear it. </p>\n<p>Be careful with cave-ins. It is better to use them as a plot device to trap or steer the Characters than to crush your party into pulp. A very loud noise, a fumble while trying to move some debris, or any similar occurrence has a [[/br 1d100 # Minor Collapse Chance]]{10%} chance to cause a minor collapse, while any explosion has a [[/br 1d100 # Minor Collapse Chance]]{25%} chance <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">of causing a minor collapse and may even cause the ceiling to give way if the Characters are particularly cavalier about casting destructive spells. </span></p>\n<h4>Mapping and Movement </h4>\n<p>Even if the Characters have a copy of Johann’s map, they have to stop and check their bearings, so you should insist on a cautious movement rate unless combat, or running like the blazes, is involved. </p>\n<p>If the Characters insist on moving faster, or are forced to do so (for example, because of the fear induced by the @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror}), they must succeed on a <strong>Difficult (–10) Navigation</strong> Test to not become lost. Additionally, an <strong>Average (+20) Agility </strong>Test is required each round the Characters spend running. On a failure, the Character trips and falls, suffering a @Condition[Prone] Condition.</p>\n<h3>Playing the Brood Horror </h3>\n<p>The @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror} is an enormous and bloated gigantic rat. Fleshy and hairless, both front and back legs end in iron-hard claws that can be used for tunnelling through stone or tearing apart the enemies of the Skaven. </p>\n<p>The @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror} is massive and vicious. In a confined area it is a deadly enemy indeed, capable of inflicting lethal damage very quickly. The Characters must try to lure it into an area where several people can get around the creature and attack it, or to get into a position where they can use missile fire and ranged spells while the creature cannot get at them. This can only be done with very narrow passages where the Brood Horror cannot follow, but where a line of sight can be established. @Scene[xVhgwauxF2EH99B8]{Oberholzbek Mines - Lower Tunnels} shows the few such places where this can be done. Luring the monster is not too difficult, since the Brood Horror is ravenous and will certainly chase the Characters. The Brood Horror will not leave the mine if the Characters retreat to the surface. </p>\n<p>@Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horrors} are not intelligent. It is not obvious to the Brood Horror that following prey towards a narrow passage where it cannot follow, but down which they can launch missile attacks, is stupid. To represent the monstrosity’s low intelligence, it falls for any trick once. These may include the narrow passage plus missile fire trick, the use of a decoy and a rear attack, an ambush lure, the use of a (very strong) trip rope, using a tethered animal as bait for an ambush, and so on. The Brood Horror has a simple goal: to get at people in the mines and eat them. </p>\n<p>The @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror} is able to tunnel through rock. So powerful are its claws and jaws that it can move through solid rock with an effective movement rate of 2. This allows it to bypass obstacles (such as narrow passages) and take the most direct route to its prey. The Characters may not be fully aware of this, and it is quite fair to surprise them. </p>\n<h4>Rising Horror </h4>\n<p>The Brood Horror cannot ascend the iron ladders in the shafts (see below), but it can climb between levels by tunnelling through rock. Obviously it can’t do this in a vertical line. When the Brood Horror ascends a level (from its tunnels to the lower mines, or from the lower to the upper mines) by tunnelling, it takes 20 rounds, emerging at a spot 1d10 yards away from where it began tunnelling upwards on the lower level, leaving an irregular winding passage behind. This will leave a pile of rubble on the lower level below the passage. Map 1 shows the two ascending tunnels the Brood Horror has already dug from its lair to the lower mines. It can ascend and descend these tunnels at a movement rate of. </p>\n<h4>Wounded Horror </h4>\n<p>If the Brood Horror is reduced to 10 or fewer Wounds, it backs off and tries to hide in the tunnel complex it has created. Its high movement rate should enable it to escape and outrun the Characters. It retreats back to the sealed cavern marked on Map 1. The Brood Horror will not sally forth again until it has regenerated back to 25 or more Wounds. It will almost certainly have to be hunted down to this chamber and killed here. Note that the two entrances allow the Characters the possibility of creating a diversion at one entrance to distract the Brood Horror and catch it off guard, if they can move through the other entrance quickly enough.</p>\n<h3>Mine Locations </h3>\n<p>@Scene[xVhgwauxF2EH99B8]{Lower Tunnels} notes many of these, such as major mine faces and abandoned mine faces. While these are self-explanatory, a number of locations on the map require further details. </p>\n<h4>Alcoves </h4>\n<p>The map indicates alcoves along the passageways. These are small recesses off main mine tunnels that are used to store rope, sacks, boxes, and the like. They usually have a couple of strong wooden boxes on which miners can sit and eat or drink during working hours. The lamps here have run out of fuel and there is no spare oil hidden away. </p>\n<h4>Partially Collapsed Mine Sections </h4>\n<p>The map shows certain areas where minor collapses have already occurred. In passages, these partly block the way. In mine-face chambers, they provide rock cover that Characters can hide behind. This is important when Characters consider the possibility of luring the @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror} into an ambush. </p>\n<h4>Shafts </h4>\n<p>These vertical shafts lead from the upper to the lower mine levels. They are 15 yards deep and 3 yards across. On two sides, iron rungs have been driven into the rock to create sturdy ladders (they have to take the weight of miners with sacks of ore). Use standard climbing rules when the Characters climb the shafts. </p>\n<h4>Weak Areas </h4>\n<p>The pit props and supports here are particularly weak. Ominously creaking wood and dust falls are typical in these areas. You can use them to unnerve the Characters, or to increase the chances of a minor cave-in. </p>\n<h4>Rock Debris </h4>\n<p>These are piles of rock that hamper, but do not totally prevent, Character movement. They are caused by the tunnelling @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror}, or a pit prop collapsing, leading to part of the wall or ceiling giving way. It takes the Characters twice as long to bypass them as their normal movement rate. If Characters have (or want) to run through the debris, they must make an <strong>Average (+20) Agility </strong>Test. Those who fail suffer the @Condition[Prone] Condition. </p>\n<h3>Ending The Adventure </h3>\n<p>The townspeople pay the Characters promptly when they emerge with evidence of the @Actor[JDzaQOn62nmGgpuL]{Brood Horror’s} death, and begin to restart maintenance work on the upper mine levels. There should be nothing in particular to delay the Characters. </p>\n<h4>Experience Points </h4>\n<p>@Exp[20, Roleplaying in Oberholzbek]{20 XP per Character for roleplaying in Oberholzbek.}</p>\n<p>@Exp[20, Careful Planning]{20 XP each for careful planning} (getting supplies, asking about a map, planning a course of action, and so on).</p>\n<p>@Exp[50, Killing the Brood Horror]{50 XP per Character for killing the Brood Horror.}</p>","folder":"paL9BPwvstPNo5rx","sort":150000,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Horror in the Darkness","sort":150000}}}

are heading to a cavern in the Lower Tunnels that they stumbled across by accident the last time they went down. They made a rudimentary map and have good equipment including ropes and lanterns. The GM decides that the test should be a Challenging (+0) Navigation Test. Astrid has the best Navigation skill at 45, so she opts to lead the party. Astrid rolls a 60 for her Navigation test, but she benefits from Gottri and Benni lending her assistance, meaning her Navigation is effectively 65. So she passes the test with +0 SL — a Marginal Success. This means that the party will face 3 Hazards in the Sewers, 3 in the Upper Tunnels and 3 in the Lower Tunnels</em>.</p>\n<h4>Order of Encounters </h4>\n<p>The GM decides the order in which Encounters are faced by the Characters. 50–75% of Hazards are faced during the journey into the Undercity, and the remainder faced on the way out. However, in order to reach the Upper Tunnels Characters must first navigate the sewers, and in order to reach the Lower Tunnels they must navigate the Upper Tunnels. Under-Middenheim, should Characters be mad enough to go there, is deeper still.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Astrid, Gottri and Benni head down. Their goal is a cavern in the Lower Tunnels. The GM decides the journey will go along the following lines: 2 Sewer Hazards – 1 Upper Tunnel Hazard – 2 Lower Tunnel Hazards – the goal is reached – 1 Lower Tunnel Hazard – 2 Upper Tunnel Hazards – 1 Sewer Hazard – back on the streets of Middenheim.</em></p>\n<h4>Calling it off</h4>\n<p>It may be that after a damaging Hazard the party feel they have no hope of reaching their goal. If this is so they can return to the surface. If the GM still has Hazards left to play on the party for the levels they return through, these may still be faced.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:<em> Astrid, Gottri and Benni are suffering from the effects of 2 bruising Hazards and they have only reached the Upper Tunnels. They decide to turn back. The GM had planned to have them face 2 Upper Tunnel Hazards and 1 Sewer Hazard on their return journey. Feeling merciful, the GM opts to have them face only the Sewer Hazard before they reach the relative safety of the surface.</em></p>\n<h4>Marching Order</h4>\n<p>Whether it is a narrow platform on the side of a sewer culvert or the passageways of the tunnel systems, most of the Undercity is very cramped and narrow. The Characters will have to decide on a marching order. Two people may walk side by side in normal conditions, and therefore benefit from the assistance of those directly in front and behind them, if need be. Certain Hazards may affect people according to marching order.</p>\n<h4>Raina’s Patrol</h4>\n<p>@Actor[uL6CLyF3u6QpRDQ9]{Raina Müs} is an important villain.

This vat of horrors will strip the flesh from the bones of any creature unfortunate enough to fall into it, and vats of it are occassionaly hauled up to the walls both to act as weaponry against any attackers, and as a source of sustenence to the current denizens of the Keep.</p>\n<h4>The Lower Keep</h4>\n<p>Since the coming of the forces of Nurgle to the Keep much of its interior has become covered in unnatural growths. The walls are coated in thick, leathery skin that bulges with sodden, putrid life. Blisters as large as dinner plates swell and rupture, spilling corrosive pustulent material to the floors below, along with the occassional Nurgling, a lesser and unusually joyous daemon of Nurgle. Should the Characters pursue any Skaven into the keep, they will find some of them being dragged into these ruptured blisters by a horde of giggling daemons. If they get too close they may find the same happening to them.</p>\n<h4>Middle Floor</h4>\n<p>Should the Characters make it this far they will find the central floors of the tower transformed into a place of worship. Here rivulets of bile criss-cross the floor, drawing out an arcane tribute to Nurgle, the Plague Lord, and God of Disease. Any living creature who sets foot upon these floors without divine protection must make a <strong>Difficult (-10) Endurance</strong> Test each round or contract @Item[GPWRN4YA3fMWcgEH]{Nurgle’s Rot}. For each hour they remain here they will contract some other disease of the GM’s choosing, should the Rot not prove sufficently lethal.</p>\n<p>The Chaos Champion Woerot the Tainted can be found here, offering up choice Skaven corpses as vessals for new disease to his favoured diety. As the Characters watch, the corpses bloat and burst, spilling yellow-green bile across the flagstones.</p>\n<h4>Upper Floors</h4>\n<p>Once the sole domain of Morath, and designed to echo the glory of lost Mourkain, this dimunitive tower is the last spot in Brass Keep to resist the corrupting power of Nurgle. Despite numerous attempts by the servants of Nurgle, the lingering essense of Death cannot be cleansed from the place. While the undead are often carriers of disease, they do not fall prey to it, and so are hated by the Lord of Plague. Thus this area is shunned, and should the Characters make it this far (the Skaven certainly won’t) they may find a brief reprieve from the plague ridden horrors that pursue them. </p>\n<p>Such a reprieve will be especially brief, however, as the necromantic energies of the tower drains their very life. After a Character has spent a number of muinutes equal to their Toughness Bonus in the tower, they will begin to loose one Wound each turn. This does not feel painful — rather they begin to feel cold and particulary tired. Any Character with the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent will notice this immediately, as hungry strands of <em>Dhar </em>being to stream into their mouth and nostrils, but others must pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test to realise what is happening. </p>\n<p>If a Character in the Tower is reduced to 0 Wounds, they immediately die, and return as a @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.T79RqnDOAQLn3I1s]{Zombie} [[/br 1d10]] minutes later. </p>\n<h3>Denizens of Brass Keep</h3>\n<p>The @Actor[MWUYvCCpNwg6eosZ]{Blightkings} are the current masters of Brass Keep, holding out in hope that the forces of Chaos will again swarm them Empire. On that day the gates of Brass Keep will be thrown open, and a plague erupt forth that will surely end the Empire at last.</p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-horned-rat/assets/images/brass-keep.webp","folder":"rFdWy2j3CtQIsdy6","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AUExJb3c35oBvDuA":3},"flags":{"wfrp4e-horned-rat":{"initialization-folder":"Brass Keep","sort":0}}}

Seconds later a rumbling roar echoes from the mountains. The picket’s garrison stumble from their barracks, clumsily preparing weapons, as @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} shouts orders at them and Hildegund queries the sentries as to what they saw. Minutes later, the sound of distant, tolling bells emerges from the pass, ringing discordantly. They fade away, to be replaced with a faint, high-pitched screeching, like thousands of rats all squealing at once.</p>\n<p>Clan Mange has begun its attack on the Brass Keep. </p>\n<p>The atmosphere of dread and anticipation breaks as the camp springs into action. @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} soon has the garrison organised into ranks, halberds and crossbows at the ready. Degni can be seen shouting at a trio of soldiers as they drag Astrid towards the palisade. @Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik} and his men are soon mounted and ready for action, though they look uncertain as to what role they might play. If Characters offer to help, @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund} asks them to stand ready. Everyone is expecting an attack to emerge from the pass, but instead the sounds of bells and squealing continue unabated.</p>\n<h3>Any Volunteers?</h3>\n<p>The next hour is spent at attention, with a hasty breakfast ferried to watchful soldiers as sounds of battle echo down from the Keep. Occasional chunks of fortification land far off in the blasted wasteland, and more than once the ground churns where Skaven digging machines draw close to the surface. It is clear that approaching the Keep is a dangerous prospect, but as the long minutes wear on and the sounds of battle wane it becomes clear that someone must soon venture out to scout the Keep.</p>\n<p>As the sun begins to dawn, @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} confers with @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund}, @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni} and @Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik}. If the Characters are on good terms with her, she invites them too. If not, Hildegund suggests including them, to which Emmiline reluctantly agrees.</p>\n<p>@Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} needs to know what is happening in the pass, but is reluctant to send her own men. @Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik’s} rota could go, but the terrain is unsuitable for cavalry. If the Characters do not volunteer, @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund} points out that this disturbance coinciding with their presence at the picket is unlikely to be a coincidence. This is why the Graf sent them — they would be failing in their duties if they didn’t investigate now.</p>\n<p>@Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} agrees to let the Characters scout the pass. If they are on good terms with her, she is happy to support their effort to complete their mission. If they’ve angered her, she’s happy to let them get themselves killed.</p>\n<p>If the Characters have won the good regard of any of the NPCs at the picket, they approach to offer their support.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} lets them requisition any equipment they want from the Storehouse.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>@Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund} gives them directions to a hidden path, a little over halfway down the pass. It leads to an excellent vantage point from which to observe the Brass Keep.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>@Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik} hands one of the Characters a horn, carved around the rim with pictures of Ungol horse archers. He tells them if they are in serious need, to sound the horn three times, and he will lead his rota to their aid.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>@Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni} gives them his supply of explosives, with advice on how to use them. They’re not much use as ranged weapons, but he hopes the Characters find use for them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The garrison watch, silently, as the Characters cross through the palisade gate. They clearly don’t expect to see any of them again.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>DERELICTION OF DUTY</em></h3>\n<p><em>Discretion is the better part of valour, but if the Characters fail to take the initiative in the events to come it ends badly for everyone, so they should be given every chance to get close to Brass Keep and witness events with their own eyes. However, should they fail to do so, and assuming you wish to keep the adventure on track, events can play out a little differently. </em></p>\n<p><em>While the troops watch the mountains, and a volunteer force led by Hildegund ventures into the wasteland, a rumbling is heard behind the picket line. Characters have a moment to react as a section of the picket collapses inward, tents and all. A handful of navigationally challenged Skaven spew out of a tunnel that was meant to exit in the courtyard of Brass Keep. The Skaven attack the picket forces, who see them off with little trouble. Characters may contribute to the fight, but the unfortunate Skaven are outmatched and the battle can go only one way.</em></p>\n<p><em>The tunnel is collapsed, preventing the creatures from escaping, and the creatures can be pressed for information. The captive may even be pressed into assisting with the interrogation. The creatures squeal that it’s all a ‘</em>big-big mistake<em>’, and that they were meant to ‘k</em>ill the plague things, and steal their life-stone, yes-yes!<em>’ If these captives are asked about the flash of green light, or the observers on the peak (see <strong>The Scout Returns </strong>below), they look from one to another before clamming up. If persuaded to continue speaking, a one-eared Skaven will offer </em></p>\n<p><em>‘</em>Test-test new cannon, yes yes! Meant for killing plague things only!<em>’ The foul creatures claim to have no further information, and indeed they know precious little more — but if they are imprisoned together they eat the one-eared Skaven.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Into the Pass</h3>\n<p>The pass is dark, and the temperature seems to fall two degrees as soon as the Characters cross the picket line. There is no life to be seen. The ground is bare stone, and the only movement is that of the stream. The cacophony has died down, but the Characters still hear the squealing of rats, and clash of weapons.</p>\n<p>If the Characters ride up the pass, the ground by the stream is flat enough for horses. The ground ascends unevenly to either side, rising up to sheer cliffs (any Ride tests in this terrain are three steps more difficult). The pass twists and turns, quickly hiding the palisade from sight.</p>\n<p>Any Character with @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} can see that the pass is heavy with <em>Dhar</em>. Any spells cast with <em>Dhar </em>gain +2 SL, while casting with any other wind of magic suffers a penalty of –1SL.</p>\n<h4>Rats Fleeing a Shattered Siege</h4>\n<p>A few minutes after entering the pass, the Characters encounter a band of @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{Clanrats}. These Skaven have realised the battle is going badly. Rather than returning to the tunnels (where they would either be punished or ordered back to the Keep), they have decided to take their chances with the pass. They are making no effort to be stealthy, screeching to each other in anger and fear, so Characters hear them coming with an <strong>Easy (+40) Perception</strong> Test. There isn’t much cover in the pass, but Characters can attempt to hide with a <strong>Hard (–20) Stealth</strong> Test, opposed by the Clanrats’ Perception (roll one Perception test for the Clanrats, as they aren’t paying much attention to their surroundings). If the Characters win, the Clanrats suffer a @Condition[Surprised] Condition.</p>\n<p>There are two Clan Mange @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{Clanrats} for every Character. They round the pass 40 yards ahead. All of them suffer from injuries taken in the battle at the Brass Keep (each has only 6 Wounds remaining), and are exhausted from the battle and a lack of food (suffer a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition). Despite their poor condition, they charge the Characters once they see them.</p>\n<p>The Clanrats’ desperation drives them, and they fight to the death in their attempt to escape in any direction except back towards the Keep. Once they are defeated, the Characters notice that they are armed with hammers and axes that are clearly not of Skaven manufacture. While rusty and notched, they are clearly well made, and each is marked with a Khazalid rune. An <strong>Easy (+40) Lore (Dwarf) </strong>or <strong>Trade (Any) </strong>Test will identify the rune as some kind of maker’s mark. It is actually the guildmark of the Karak Skygg Weaponsmiths’ Guild, which @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni} is able to identify if they are shown to him.</p>\n<h4>Ratholes</h4>\n<p>As the Characters round another twist in the pass, they spot what appears to be the entrance to a mine up ahead. Loose earth and rocks are scattered around the entrance, and the roof is propped up with crude wooden supports. The tracks of hundreds of Skaven can clearly be seen emerging from the tunnel and heading east, further down the pass. Anyone who has ever been a miner, or who has the <em>Trade (Engineer) </em>or <em>Track </em>skills, can tell that the mine was dug out from the inside, and only within the last few hours.</p>\n<p>If the Characters venture inside the mine, they find it descends steeply for 30 ft and then twists out of sight. There are smaller tunnels, barely big enough for a human to fit through, branching off from the main tunnel. These lack any support at all, and the Characters find one that has collapsed completely. The arm of an unfortunate Skaven can be seen sticking out of the rubble. A thick layer of dirt covers everything, and as they enter the mine one of the supports slips loose, causing another shower of earth and rocks to rain down. The sounds of Skaven squealing and skittering can be heard further down the mine, though they don’t appear to be coming any closer.</p>\n<p>A number of pickaxes and shovels are scattered along the tunnel. These are well-made dwarf tools, and each bears the guildmark of the Karak Skygg Metalsmiths’ Guild.</p>\n<p>It should be clear that exploring the mine is unwise. Not only could there be any number of Skaven inside, but the whole thing is unstable, and could come down at any moment.</p>\n<p>If the Characters want to destroy the mine entrance, they have several options. Damaging supports at the entrance causes a partial collapse, but the Skaven can dig through it in mere minutes. A Character with <em>Lore (Engineering)</em>, or equivalent skill, can make an <strong>Average (+20)</strong> Test to identify some load-bearing supports a little deeper into the tunnel, and use ropes to pull them loose from the safety of the entrance. Alternatively, if the Characters have any of @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni’s} bombs, they can use them to destroy the tunnel. If Degni instructed them in how to set the explosives, no test is required, otherwise an <strong>Easy (+40) Ranged (Blackpowder) </strong>or <strong>Lore (Engineering)</strong> Test is required.</p>\n<h4>Approaching the Keep</h4>\n<p>The pass turns again ahead, and the sounds of battle are closer. The Characters have almost reached Brass Keep. They can continue travelling along the floor of the pass, but an alternative path climbs the cliff wall to their left. If @Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund} has given them directions to it, the Characters find it with ease. Alternatively, a Character trying to find another way to the Keep can try a <strong>Hard (–20) Perception</strong> or an <strong>Average (+20) Outdoor Survival</strong> Test to find it. If they have horses with them, they must decide whether to hobble them at the base of the pass, or release them to make their way back to the picket.</p>\n<p>If they continue along the floor of the pass, they come upon a band of 12 Skaven @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{Clanrats} milling about in confusion. A larger, better-fed Skaven tries to organise them, battering them with the flat of his blade and screaming orders. If the Characters attack, the Skaven suffer a @Condition[Surprised] Condition on the first round. If the Characters wait, one of the Clanrats musters enough courage to attack their commander, and suddenly the rest turn on him as well. After hacking him to death, the Clanrats turn to flee — right into the path of the Characters.</p>\n<p>The Clanrats are all injured (down to 6 Wounds) and suffer a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition. They are armed with Dwarf weapons from Karak Skygg. If half of their number are downed they rout, running back towards Brass Keep. The Characters can pursue them, making it round the final bend in the pass.</p>\n<p>If the Characters use the hidden path, they will be able to spot the Skaven far below them, and see the Clanrats turn on their officer and flee. The Characters can continue along the pass wall. The going is steep, and the footing occasionally treacherous. Each Character should make a <strong>Challenging (0) Athletics </strong>or <strong>Easy (+40) Climb </strong>Test, or suffer a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition.</p>\n<h3>The Brass Keep</h3>\n<p>As the Characters round the last bend of the pass, Clan Mange’s last effort to assault the Brass Keep plays out before them. The keep sits high above the pass, a strange light glowing from the windows of the central tower. A waterfall pours from a tarn next to the keep, pooling at the base of the cliff before flowing down the pass. A crooked, twisting stairway climbs the side of the mountain, upon which hundreds of Skaven scrabble up towards the keep. Others climb straight up the cliff walls, heedless of the risk. Stones drop from above, killing ratmen in droves, their bodies falling to the pass below. Hundreds more corpses lie on the sides of the pass, casualties of earlier assaults. Mine entrances, similar to the one the Characters passed earlier, dot the pass near the foot of the stairs, where bands of Clanrats mill about as their officers try to get them organised.</p>\n<p>Of interest is a massive hole blasted in the east side of the Keep. It’s edges glow with a harsh green light, and Skaven are pouring towards it. Unfortunately the hole is too high to be of much use in actually breaching the fort, but is an impressive sight. The walls of Brass Keep have seen off many a siege down the years, and its walls have proved highly resistant to damage from magical and mundane artillery alike, which Degni is happy to tell the Characters should he hear of the breach. </p>\n<p>Characters who pass a <strong>Difficult (–20) Perception</strong> Test notice an odd sight. On a nearby peak, close enough to get a good look but far enough to be out of danger, several figures are watching the battle. If viewed through a spyglass, they are seen to be Skaven, pointing odd devices towards the keep and apparently taking measurements. They are low-ranking Engineers from Karak Skygg, dispatched to observe the effectiveness of the Moonbreaker cannon, which just breached the castle wall.</p>\n<p>Suddenly a thunderous groan emanates from the keep, drowning out all other sound. The great gate rumbles open. The Skaven surge forward for a moment, until they are met by a charge from within. Dozens of huge warriors, clad in full plate mail and wielding greatswords and huge axes, flow out of the keep and cut through the Clanrats. The Skaven lines hold for a second, then break. Panic takes hold, Skaven surge down the stairs, dozens falling to their doom as their fellows push them out of the way. Seeing this, Skaven at the base of the cliff turn and run, forcing their way into the mine entrances — which begin to collapse under the pressure. As the dust clears, the surviving ratmen scatter in all directions. The Chaos Warriors continue to pursue them down the stairs, cutting them down in droves.</p>\n<h4>On the Run</h4>\n<p>While the Skaven are confused and disorganised, if the Characters don’t hurry, they’ll find themselves cut off or overrun by the Skaven and the pursuing Chaos Warriors. </p>\n<p>Their one advantage is that the Skaven are confused, and getting in each other’s way. Some are desperately trying to dig their way through the collapsed mine entrances, while others flee in every direction, some trying to climb the walls of the pass. A few are even trying to organise a desperate defence, but as the Chaos Warriors grow closer their nerve fails.</p>\n<p>If the Characters took the high pass and left their horses hobbled below, they find that one of them is dead, and is currently being devoured by a trio of starving Skaven. The Characters can easily sneak up on them (they automatically suffer a @Condition[Surprised] Condition), but one of the Characters will then have to ride double with another (–10 to any Ride tests).</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em>THE ROTA TO THE RESCUE</em></h3>\n<p><em>If Tylik gave the Characters his horn, they may decide to use it to summon aid. @Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik} immediately leads his rota into the pass, but it takes some time for them to reach the Characters. You should have them arrive at a dramatically suitable moment, announcing their arrival with a flight of arrows that cuts into the Skaven ranks. This causes the Skaven to scatter in confusion, giving the Characters a chance to escape. Tylik and his men will surround them and escort them to safety.</em></p>\n<p><em>If the Characters use the horn before Clan Mange are broken at Brass Keep, it draws attention. A dozen @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{Clanrats} led by a @Actor[DcBGKJTI6xFzE4PK]{Stormvermin} are dispatched to investigate, and find the Characters a few rounds before the Ungols. The Characters have to hold them off until the rota arrives to help.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether the Characters made their way up the high path or along the pass floor, they have enough of a head start on the Skaven to keep ahead of them — until they reach the mine entrance. If the entrance still stands, the Characters find eight @Actor[CegfesYJax9LhoYz]{Clanrats} led by a @Actor[DcBGKJTI6xFzE4PK]{Stormvermin} waiting for them. If the Characters damaged the entrance to the mine, they find that the Skaven have partially cleared the debris. Four Clanrats are outside, and squeal for help. Two more Skaven emerge each round, until all 12 are out, followed by the Stormvermin. If the Characters completely destroyed the mine entrance (using @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni’s} explosives or some engineering ingenuity), they find a single desperate Skaven, frantically clawing at the collapsed mine entrance. It flees as soon as it sees them.</p>\n<p>The Characters can fight their way through the Skaven, or (if they are on horseback) try to go around them. In order to evade the Skaven, they will need to make <strong>Hard (–20) Ride </strong>Tests.</p>\n<p>If the Characters spend more than 6 rounds at the mine entrance, they hear the screeching of the surviving Clan Mange forces as they approach. They have 2 more rounds to dispatch any remaining Clanrats before the routed horde arrives. While most of the Skaven will try to flee through the mine entrance (or begin desperately digging their way through the detritus), over three dozen will immediately begin following the Characters.</p>\n<p>Use the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.03r3y37RFKAFM82c]{Pursuit} rules. The Skaven begin at a distance of 6. Make a single Athletics test for the Skaven each round. If the Characters are on horseback, don’t forget to modify their Ride tests because of the uneven terrain of the pass.</p>\n<p>If the Skaven score the highest SL on any round, choose one of the following events.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some Clanrats break off the chase for a moment, take out their slings and fling rocks at the Characters. Each Character is attacked by a sling shot (roll to hit as normal).<br /><br /></li>\n<li>As the Characters round a corner of the pass, one of the more adventurous Clanrats takes a shortcut. He leaps nimbly over the rough terrain by the side of the pass and jumps at the lead Character. Have them make <strong>Opposed WS</strong> Tests (the Character may use <strong>Melee (Brawl)</strong> instead). If the Character is successful, the Skaven is knocked aside. If the Clanrat is successful, he clings to the Character for a moment before thinking better of it and letting go (the Character suffers a –2 SL penalty to their next Pursuit test).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Caught!</h4>\n<p>If the Skaven catch up to the Characters, they quickly surround them, but are reluctant to engage. They are panting for breath, and half-starved. The Characters can see a wild, desperate ferocity in their eyes. Some eventually muster up the courage to attack, and one Skaven leaps forward per Character. In their maddened state, these Clanrats have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.yRhhOlt18COq4e1q]{Frenzy} Trait.</p>\n<p>If a Skaven is reduced to 0 Wounds or is otherwise knocked prone, a starved Skaven pounces on him, biting into his flesh and ripping out gobs of meat. Other Skaven join in, and suddenly they all turn on each other, biting and stabbing ferociously. Skaven engaged with the Characters continue to fight, but if the Characters flee, they are not followed. If they look back, they see Skaven devouring each other in a frenzied melee.</p>\n<h3>Return to the Picket</h3>\n<p>Once the Characters make it back to the picket, @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Commander Emmiline} immediately demands they report their findings. She then orders @Actor[lRSRPvsV4jJlJua5]{Tylik} to take a message to the Kärzburdger Estate. If the Characters are on good terms with her, she will also have him send one of his men with a message to Graf Todbringer.</p>\n<p>@Actor[PmyVnox18I2TIETs]{Hildegund} is eager to hear what the Characters have to say, and asks them to repeat what they saw of the battle at the Keep itself. Neither woman will wish to see the Characters depart the picket until the following morning at least. They are the sole witnesses to events at the Keep, and as such cannot be allowed to wander the pass even as daylight stretches thin. </p>\n<h4>The Scout Returns</h4>\n<p>As the Characters are being debriefed, shouts of welcome are heard elsewhere in the camp. A scout is ushered into the command tent shortly thereafter. The scout, Private Ewa Bruchmeier, breathlessly raves about witnessing <em>‘a bolt of green lightning shooting from the peak of a mountain to the east</em>’. If the Characters are on good terms with @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline}, she allows them to stay while the scout catches her breath. If not, she ushers them out of the tent before asking the scout to continue. They must track the woman down later if they wish to hear her story.</p>\n<p>The scout recounts that she was posted high above the picket on the south side of the valley, carrying out her observation of the keep, when her attention was drawn by a bright green flash from a mountaintop, within the Middle Mountains and several days south of Brass Keep. She watched as bright flashes flickered out and struck the keep. Blocks of the wall tumbled away where the beam of lightning struck. The sound reached her many seconds later, which she thinks indicates that the source of the blast was very far away.</p>\n<p>Ewa also noticed figures on the nearby peak observing Brass Keep, but she keeps this to herself, unless specifically asked. Observing them through her spyglass, she noted their ratlike features, and decided to neglect to mention seeing creatures that reminded her of her aunt’s ravings about Skaven. However, if the Evidence Tracker is at Plausible Denial or higher, she mentions seeing ‘creatures’ on the peak, revealing more details if pressed. She got a good look at them, and noted that they were carrying devices very similar to those used by @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni} when test firing Astrid; brass objects that measure range and trajectory.</p>\n<h4>Dwarf Craftsmanship</h4>\n<p>The Characters may have recovered some of the Dwarf weapons or tools from the Skaven. If they show any of these to @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni} (or describe the guild marks on them), he instantly identifies them as being from Karak Skygg. He has seen copies of these runes in the records of @Compendium[wfrp4e-middenheim.middenheim-journals.A6D8GCA2S0g8vw8K]{Middenheim’s Dwarven Engineers’ Guild}, and heard stories of the fall of Karak Skygg from other engineers. He can tell the Characters how to reach Karak Skygg from the picket, and what he knows of its history.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[4S4DpdUVZgRqo7Kn]{Degni} is informed of what Ewa Bruchmeier witnessed, and has a chance to confer with the scout, he determines that the distant mountaintop is the site of Karak Skygg. He says no artillery piece designed by either Dwarf or Manling could shoot accurately over such a distance, and the implications of such a weapon terrify him. </p>\n<h4>Unexpected visitor</h4>\n<p>As evening approaches, a shout sounds out from the picket line, as a guard spots something in the pass. A strange buzzing noise echoes off the mountain walls, grating on the Characters’ ears. Flying high above the mountain stream is a hideous beast, a bloated black insect at least 10 ft in length. Its round belly is covered in yellow pustules, and writhing tentacles slither out from between its mandibles. Sitting between its wings is putrid figure clad in tattered robes, bile streaming from a dozen open wounds. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Chaos) </strong>Test identifies the creature as a sorcerer of Nurgle, and doubtless an ally to the armoured figures in the keep. He pauses and tosses something into the stream, gurgling ‘<em>Catch it!’</em> in a phlegm-filled voice. He then turns and flies back up the pass.</p>\n<p>The object slowly floats down the stream towards the palisade. @Actor[rCdeAWvx9ToE9CDy]{Emmiline} has one of her men carefully retrieve it, piercing it on the head of a halberd and then shoving it in a sack, before burning it. If any of the Characters ask to look at it before it’s destroyed, they will find it is a rotting Skaven head, with strange symbols carved into the skin.

If the party is really going off-track, Sergeant Stoll arrives at their lodgings. @Actor[WkrLGgu5qPHzUFiB]{Kalzbad} returned and ordered him to bring a final strongbox from the barracks to the purple door on Begleitersallee.
