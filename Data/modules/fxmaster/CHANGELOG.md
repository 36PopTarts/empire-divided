## [3.0.0](https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/fxmaster/compare/v2.7.0...v3.0.0) (2022-07-17)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* * Support for v9 has been dropped
* Weather effects have been renamed to particle effects:
  * The hooks `fxmaster.updateWeather`, `fxmaster.switchWeather` have been
    replaced by `fxmaster.updateParticleEffects` and
	`fxmaster.switchParticleEffect`. Compatibility shims exist but will be
	removed in v4.
  * Properties of `canvas.fxmaster` have been renamed (`weather` =>
    `particleEffectsContainer`, `weatherEffects` => `particleEffects`,
	`drawWeather` => `drawParticleEffects`)
  * `CONFIG.fxmaster.weather` is deprecated and has been replaced by
    `CONFIG.fxmaster.particleEffects`. A compatibility shim still exists
	but it will be removed in v4.
* The hook `fxmaster.drawWeather` has been removed
* Many assets have been moved. For the most important things (e.g. macro
  icons), there are migration, but not for everything.
* The possibility to apply filters only to specific canvas layers has been
  removed (unfortunately necessary due to changes in foundry core).
* The implementation of the masking functionality has changed completely,
  which very likely breaks compatibility with modules such as
  Weather Blocker and Perfect Vision, which have been patching that
  functionality.
* The `updateMask` hook has been removed.

### Features

* add support for Foundry Virtual Tabletop v10 ([d8c48a4](https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/fxmaster/commit/d8c48a435ff42c73d9e5036b1c73cd4ba93f4766))

## [2.0.0-rc1](https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/fxmaster/compare/v1.2.1...v2.0.0-rc1) (2021-12-17)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* remove `canvas.fxmaster.playVideo`, use
`canvas.specials.playVideo` instead.
* In foundry V9, it's not possible anymore to manipulate
the permissions in `CONST`. For that reason, it was necessary to switch
to using a setting instead. Unfortunately, it is not easily possible to
to migrate from the old way to the new way, so users will have to adapt
their settings to match what they had configured previously.
* A lot of things have been moved around. In particular, the es modules
  * module/controls.js
  * filterEffects/FilterManager.js
  * filterEffects/filtersDB.js
  * specialEffects/specialsDB.js
  * specialEffects/SpecialsLayer.js
  * weatherEffects/weatherDB.js
  * weatherEffects/WeatherLayer.js

  do not exist anymore. Asset files also have been moved.
