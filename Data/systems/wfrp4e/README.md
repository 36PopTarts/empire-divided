**[Current Version]**: `5.1.0`

**[Compatibility]**: `FoundryVTT V9`

This system is intended for use with [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](http://foundryvtt.com/) to play in the grim and perilous world of Warhammer.

## Installation - Auto Installer (Recommended)

You can install the system from the Foundry system installer, simply search for Warhammer Fantasy and it should show in the results.

## Current State

**Version 1.0** marked, by our estimation, where the system is fully equipped with all the necessary features as well as the bells and whistles that should provide a very smooth experience when playing Warhammer Fantasy 4th Edition.

**Version 2.0** marked the removal of content due to increasing copyright concerns. Luckily Cubicle 7 was open to supporting Foundry officially, bringing us to 3.0

**Version 3.0** brought back warhammer better than ever, the official modules provided by me working with Cubicle 7 brings the Warhammer system to the forefront of the possibilites of gaming in Foundry VTT and the seamlessness of official content to make the GM's life easier. See below for more details on official modules.

**Version 4.0**, Foundry 0.8.x compatible, major refactoring for cleaner code to take advantage of the Document refactor.

**Version 5.0**, the current version, compatible with Foundry V9
